Now a variety of\ncompanies are building them\u2014or something close.\n\nBy Gideon Lewis-Kraus\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nBy 2030, customers could have access to self-driving, electric air taxis that\ntravel between neighborhood \u201cvertiports.\u201d One company promises a seven-minute\ntrip from Manhattan to the airport for the price of a rideshare.Photographs by\nBalazs Gardi for The New Yorker\n\nA little more than a decade ago, Founders Fund, a venture-capital firm run by\nthe entrepreneur, investor, and political gadfly Peter Thiel, issued a\nproclamation called \u201cWhat Happened to the Future?\u201d As an investment thesis, it\nwas underwhelming\u2014it advanced biotechnology, energy, and the Internet as smart\nbets\u2014but it was received as something of a spiritual treatise. Thiel was best\nknown for his early investment in Facebook, but he believed that the nation\nhad become sluggish. We might have been attempting to terraform nearby planets\nor surmount death. Instead, we made apps. His statement belonged to the genre\nof the writer F. T. Marinetti\u2019s Futurist Manifesto of 1909, which proposed\nthat Italy\u2019s moribund museum culture be razed in favor of a machine cult of\nspeed and steel: \u201cWe are going to be present at the birth of the centaur and\nwe shall soon see the first angels fly! We must break down the gates of life\nto test the bolts and the padlocks! Let us go! Here is the very first sunrise\non earth!\u201d Thiel, no poet, was punchier: \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we\ngot 140 characters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my flying car?\u201d quickly caught on as a meme in Silicon Valley and\nbeyond. For Thiel, one culprit was obvious: regulators. In a contentious\ndebate, he told Eric Schmidt, then the executive chairman of Google, that\nSchmidt was doing \u201ca fantastic job as Google\u2019s minister of propaganda,\u201d but\nthat the company had capitulated to an ethos of caution. \u201cWe\u2019ve basically\noutlawed everything having to do with the world of stuff, and the only thing\nyou\u2019re allowed to do is in the world of bits,\u201d he said. The economist Tyler\nCowen offered a more neutral assessment in his book \u201cThe Great Stagnation,\u201d\nwriting that perhaps \u201cthe low-hanging fruit has been mostly plucked.\u201d The\ncomplaint found surprising allies. The late anthropologist David Graeber, who\nat the time had no clue who Thiel was, wrote, \u201cA secret question hovers over\nus, a sense of disappointment, a broken promise we were given as children\nabout what our adult world was supposed to be like.\u201d The question? \u201cWhere, in\nshort, are the flying cars? Where are the force fields, tractor beams,\nteleportation pods, antigravity sleds, tricorders, immortality drugs, colonies\non Mars?\u201d Graeber blamed bureaucratic risk aversion and corporations concerned\nonly with short-term capitalist incentives. By 2020, when the investor Marc\nAndreessen grumbled, in one of his routine tirades, that we still didn\u2019t have\nflying cars, it felt almost dutiful.\n\nCartoon by P. S. Mueller\n\nLink copied\n\nWhile one segment of Silicon Valley lamented the perpetual absence of flying\ncars, another, it turns out, was quietly building them\u2014or, at least, something\nflying-car adjacent. Just three months after the Founders Fund manifesto\nappeared, a Canadian inventor named Marcus Leng invited his neighbors and a\ncouple of friends to his rural property, north of Lake Ontario. Leng was in\nhis early fifties, with a bowl cut of coarse graying hair. He instructed his\nguests to park their (conventional) cars in a row and cower behind them. He\nstrapped on a helmet and boarded a device that he\u2019d built in his basement. It\nhad a narrow single-seat chassis and two fixed wings, one in front and one in\nback, each with four small propellers. It was at once sleek and ungainly, as\nif a baby orca had been hitched to two snowplows. Observers described it, for\nlack of a better comparison, as looking like a U.F.O. Leng called it the\nBlackFly.\n\nLeng, who had been flying since he was a teen-ager, had long dreamed of the\n\u201cperfect aircraft\u201d\u2014something \u201cthat didn\u2019t require a pilot\u2019s license, and could\ntake off or land anywhere.\u201d He\u2019d paid close attention to past designs but\nsuspected that their propulsion systems were too heavy, too complex, and too\nunresponsive. In the previous few years, however, he\u2019d noticed that full-sized\nremote-control airplanes had all of a sudden become very good: they had enough\npower to hover and could be controlled with precision. It was nevertheless an\nentirely different thing to put a person inside one. He told me recently, \u201cThe\noriginal had no redundancy built into it at all, and any single point failure\nwould result in a total failure. It was fundamentally unsafe.\u201d At his demo,\nthe BlackFly\u2019s propellers came online with a whine, then a purr, and it lifted\ninto a hover about a metre off the ground. He pitched forward, in the\ndirection of his guests. He\u2019d thought that he would pivot into a skidding\nstop, in the manner of a skier. As he initiated a banking turn, though, the\nedge of one wing caught on the lawn. \u201cI thought, This is not going to end\nwell,\u201d he said. But the craft held steady, dug a curving divot through thirty\nfeet of grass, and came to rest. The trip lasted about twenty seconds. It was,\nas far as anyone knew, the first manned flight in an \u201celectric vertical\ntakeoff and landing vehicle,\u201d or eVTOL (pronounced \u201cee-vee-tall\u201d).\n\nToday, there are more than four hundred startups in what is called the\n\u201cadvanced air mobility\u201d industry. The term covers everything from actual\nflying-car-ish contraptions to more traditional-looking airplanes, but it\ngenerally refers to eVTOLs. For the most part, these crafts bear a greater\nresemblance to helicopter-plane hybrids than to automobiles, and they can\u2019t be\ndriven on the road; they might better be described as electric aerial vehicles\nwith the ability to hover and the no-fuss point-to-point flexibility of a car.\nSome are single-seat playthings: Jetson One, a Swedish company, has developed\na craft that looks like a little aerodynamic cage and handles like Luke\nSkywalker\u2019s X-wing. Others fly themselves: EHang, a Chinese company, has been\ntesting an autonomous passenger drone with a quadcopter design. (Its Chinese\nname translates to Ghost Intelligent Aerial Robot.) The first widespread use\nwill be for air taxis\u2014initially with pilots, then without\u2014that will move\npassengers between neighborhood \u201cvertiports.\u201d Matthew Clarke, a postdoctoral\nfellow in aeronautical engineering at M.I.T., said, \u201cIn a best-case scenario,\nwe\u2019re seeing certification in two years and flying two or three years after\nthat.\u201d The 2028 Summer Olympics, in Los Angeles, may feature the ferrying of\nathletes through the air from the village to their stadiums. Regular\ncivilians, or at least the courageous among them, could have access to such\nservices by the end of the decade. One company promises a seven-minute trip\nfrom Manhattan to an airport, with an aspiration to land inside security; seat\nprices would eventually be competitive with rideshares. Proponents imagine a\nsystem of cheap, sustainable aerial transit\u2014ribbons of humming vehicles\ninterlaced overhead.\n\nLeng\u2019s company, now called Pivotal, occupies a few nondescript buildings on\nthe marshy end of Palo Alto, wedged in behind Google and a NASA research\ncenter. The company recently began selling the BlackFly to hardy individuals.\nIt has the footprint of a monster truck, but it weighs less than three hundred\nand fifty pounds. This past January, Kristina Menton, Pivotal\u2019s C.O.O.,\nwelcomed me to the company\u2019s training center, a miniature flight school for\nprospective customers. There was a foyer with a sweeping C.G.I. panorama of\nthe aircraft in flight over a rocky Pacific coastline, a cavernous showroom\nwith a single demonstration vehicle, a classroom, and the all-important\nsimulator chamber. Menton, who served as a test pilot in the early days, told\nme, \u201cBack then, it was terrifying. You did months of training for thirty\nseconds of flight, with fifteen people there to support you. Now we just want\nto get more people in the air.\u201d She added, \u201cEverybody comes down from their\nfirst flight and has the same exact face, just the pure joy of flight.\u201d\n\nPivotal\u2019s aircraft is permitted under the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s\nspecial carve-out for \u201cultralights,\u201d a concession to the reality that the\ngovernment cannot plausibly prevent you from fastening a lawnmower engine to a\nkite and barnstorming over your back yard. Ultralight pilots are not subject\nto any training requirements. The Pivotal team is aware, however, that just\none crash might render the company\u2019s trajectory unrecoverable, and potential\ncustomers are expected to complete a two-week program at its training center.\nMeals are catered.\n\nWatch the writer fly an eVTOL himself and discuss the future of air taxis and\npersonal aerial vehicles.\n\nBefore I arrived, the company\u2019s P.R. person called to ask if I exceeded the\npilot\u2019s weight limit of two hundred pounds. The team had recently developed an\nabbreviated curriculum that took less than a week, and they invited me to try\nmy luck. If at the end they deemed me sufficiently unlikely to die, and take\nthe company with me, they would green-light me to fly. My odds of success, she\nnoted, were likely to correlate with my aptitude for video games. My small\nchildren were resolutely enthusiastic about the endeavor, my wife somewhat\nless so.\n\nThe training setup looked like a dentist\u2019s chair, with two joysticks and a\nvirtual-reality headset. A software engineer at the company reminded me that\nthis equipment could afford to be a little janky: \u201cA sim can\u2019t fall out of the\nsky.\u201d The actual BlackFly has the glide ratio of a dishwasher; a catastrophic\nfailure would entail a direct plunge to the ground. As I hesitated at the\nentrance to the training room, Menton tried to reassure me. \u201cThe simulator is\ngood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe simulator has to be good. Because even your first flight\nis a solo.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, the technologist J. Storrs Hall published a manifesto called\n\u201cWhere Is My Flying Car?,\u201d one of the few recent cultural artifacts that takes\nthe question seriously rather than symbolically. Storrs Hall\u2019s story begins\nnot with the fanciful flying cars of the future but with those of historical\nrecord. In the nineteen-twenties, a Spanish aeronautical genius named Juan de\nla Cierva invented something called an autogyro, a kind of low-rent helicopter\nprecursor. The vehicles fell to earth a lot, but their passengers frequently\nsurvived. Unfortunately, the engineer himself died as a passenger in an\nunrelated plane crash. In the thirties, Waldo Waterman sold a handful of\nAerobiles, cars with removable wings and a road-ready fuselage. Machines like\nthese might have been unwieldy, but the concept seemed within reach,\nespecially once so many veterans returned from the war with pilot training.\nThe aviation company Cessna ran magazine advertisements for the Family Car of\nthe Air, a sensible little plane that you could park in your garage, with copy\nlike \u201cRemember, Mrs. America likes to go places and see things. And when she\nfinds out that she can cover 600 miles in a morning, to shop or visit in any\none of a dozen cities, she\u2019s going to fly.\u201d\n\nBy the mid-fifties, it was almost a given that some future sedans would come\nwith wings. If we were going to live in mile-high space needles, how else\nwould we move about? The title sequence of \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d which premi\u00e8red in\n1962, doesn\u2019t show the ground once; George takes his wife and children to\ntheir respective floating platforms in his domed airship, and then heads to\nhis office at Spacely Space Sprockets, Inc. (Storrs Hall estimates that George\nhas a 1,341-horsepower vehicle, which draws on the equivalent of a thousand\npounds of jet fuel.) Some of this imagery was the standard-issue utopianism of\nthe bright-eyed mid-century, but it really wasn\u2019t that far-fetched. After all,\nmany of the era\u2019s predictions came to pass: portable radios, televisions with\nscreens \u201cthe size of a pocket handkerchief,\u201d air-conditioning, plastics. \u201cThe\nJetsons\u201d more or less foretold the invention of the Roomba. And flying cars\nwere already being built. The Aerocar had wings and a tail that could be\nstored in a trailer. The ConvAirCar had an airplane attachment that could be\nrented at an airport. But the flying car was always something of an\nengineering chimera. Ideally, cars grip the road\u2019s surface rather than depart\nfrom it\u2014a spoiler is the opposite of a wing. Most pure flying-car designs have\nbeen jury-rigged compromises between a lousy automobile and a stupid airplane.\nThe ConvAirCar\u2019s test pilot ran out of gas in the air\u2014he\u2019d been looking at the\nautomobile\u2019s fuel gauge rather than the airplane\u2019s\u2014and crashed; he survived,\nbut the project did not. The military continued to experiment with things like\nthe AirGeep, a small craft that didn\u2019t require a runway. But, for the most\npart, the dream of a flying car was dead by the late seventies.\n\nFor Storrs Hall, this was not inevitable. He lays out several interlocking\nreasons for our supposed technological stagnation, but the gist is that, as a\nsociety, we\u2019ve lost our taste for Promethean ambition\u2014flying cars fell victim\nto \u201cthe wave of hostility and suspicion of technology\u201d that swept America. In\n1973, the F.A.A. banned the Concorde from flying over the United States,\nciting noise concerns. Storrs Hall argues that it was the ban itself that\nprevented the development of quieter supersonic flight. He sees a similar\nmentality at work in the retreat from nuclear power, which seemed, well into\nthe nineteen-seventies, like the obvious successor to fossil fuels. But after\nthe core meltdown at Three Mile Island, in 1979, despite the fact that there\nwere no documented fatalities, it became almost impossible to build new\nnuclear plants in the United States. This now looks like a mistake.\n\nFor theorists of stagnation, flying cars were another victim of our\nunwillingness to bear the costs of progress. It\u2019s often remarked upon, in\nboosterish circles, that American society allows about forty thousand road\nfatalities a year but refuses to tolerate even one aviation death. Storrs Hall\ntold me, of the F.A.A., \u201cWhy can\u2019t they say, \u2018If you want to develop a flying\nmachine, go out in the desert and do whatever you want\u2019? I remember when\nAmazon was trying to test drone delivery they had to do experiments in\nCanada.\u201d In the sixties, a heliport was built atop New York City\u2019s Pan Am\nBuilding. After a period of inactivity, it was put back into use in 1977, with\nas many as sixty-four scheduled departures each day to local airports. That\nMay, there was a landing-gear failure. Four people were killed by spinning\nrotor blades; a fifth was killed by a blade that careened to the street below.\nThe heliport was permanently closed.\n\nA BlackFly is assembled at Pivotal\u2019s manufacturing center.\n\nThis story, as an explanation for why we don\u2019t fly out of our driveways, is\nboth true and incomplete. It\u2019s also the case that the contours of aviation had\nbegun to change. By the eighties, flying your own little plane had grown so\nexpensive that the activity shifted from being useful to being a hobby. At the\nsame time, commercial aviation became not only vastly cheaper but also less\nand less likely to kill you. Fifty years ago, planes went down all the time.\nThe most recent fatal crash of a domestic commercial jetliner was in 2009. For\naviators, this is nothing short of a miracle. We didn\u2019t panic and retreat from\ntechnology; we panicked and improved it. But, for decades, we didn\u2019t have the\nadvances required to make a personal flying machine that would be stable, easy\nto use, and cost-efficient. And the safety concerns are strongly felt.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this different limbic-system response\u201d to flight, Cyrus Sigari, a\npilot and a prominent investor in advanced-air-mobility companies, said.\n\u201cEverything in our bodies tells us that it\u2019s not normal, so the strong\nreaction we have to plane crashes, as a society, is \u2018Hey, I told you we\u2019re not\nsupposed to be in the air, and you went in the air and crashed.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThen, about fifteen years ago, a lot of people simultaneously noticed that\nseveral relevant technologies had caught up with us. In 2010, Larry Page, a\nco-founder of Google, had Sebastian Thrun, a German engineer, over for dinner.\nThrun ran Google X, the company\u2019s Skunk Works, and he was one of the world\u2019s\nforemost developers of autonomous vehicles. Page produced a spreadsheet of\ncalculations, which Thrun described as \u201csimilar to what Elon used to argue the\ncorrectness of Tesla.\u201d Batteries had become better and lighter, and electric\npropulsion systems dramatically more powerful. New sensors had improved\nautonomous capabilities. Page\u2019s calculations showed that there were newly\nviable methods to get into the air and stay there. \u201cWe thought it might even\ninvalidate self-driving cars, because, all things being equal, you\u2019d rather\nfly than drive,\u201d Thrun said. They decided that this was too experimental a\nproject for Google\u2014self-driving cars were one thing, but flying ones? \u201cLarry\nsaid, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ll do it myself.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the next few years, Page secretly funded multiple companies\u2014including one\ncalled Zee.Aero and another, run by Thrun, called Kittyhawk\u2014that functioned as\na kind of distributed research-and-development shop. His initial idea was to\nbuild a self-driving flying machine that could take off from and land in a\nparking space. He had an array of corporate jets, but presumably the trip to\nthe airport was still annoying. In the first five years, he put more than a\nhundred million dollars of his own money into one company alone. Page, who\ninitially kept an apartment above one of the design hangars, was never\nreferred to by name; he was called Gus, for \u201cthe guy upstairs.\u201d One team had\ntrouble sourcing batteries, so Page bought ten motorcycles off a lot and\nstripped them for fuel cells. Some engineers couldn\u2019t secure access to a wind\ntunnel, so they put their prototype on an exposed train car to Southern\nCalifornia. It was a bit of a madcap scene. At one point, a team of engineers\ndevoted themselves to their entry in Red Bull Flugtag, a contest in which\nparticipants take a running leap off a pier and glide as far as they can. (The\nteam set a record, which still stands, using the wing design from its\nvehicle.) By 2014, the team\u2019s proof-of-concept craft had completed more than\ntwo hundred successful test flights. Word began to get out, and planespotters\nskulked around outside the hangars, trying to get a glimpse of Page\u2019s\nunearthly machines.\n\nSoon enough, these successes ushered in an entire industry. Airbus spent four\nyears developing an eVTOL prototype. A German company raised an enormous\namount of money for a craft that was later rumored not to work. Storrs Hall\nattributed the sudden flourishing of flying machines to the prevalence of\ndrone technology in everyday life, and to a greater mood of optimism about\ntechnology: \u201cThe whole Zeitgeist has changed a bit, and people are beginning\nto say, \u2018Why aren\u2019t we landing on the moon anymore?\u2019 \u201d Page spread his bets\naround. Three years after Leng\u2019s maiden voyage, Pivotal got funding from Page\nand moved to Silicon Valley. In 2022, a former drone executive named Ken\nKarklin came aboard as C.E.O. He told me that, when he took the job, he got a\ncall from Chris Anderson, a former editor of Wired and later the C.T.O. of\nKittyhawk, to say, \u201cWelcome to Larry Page\u2019s air force.\u201d\n\nPivotal\u2019s simulator room is a carpeted space with an azure accent wall, a\ncouch for resting, and a snack table. The simulator chair rotates only on one\naxis\u2014nose up or nose down\u2014to capture the vehicle\u2019s jarring ascent. Some eVTOLs\nuse two sets of propellers, one for lift and one for thrust. Others use a\ntilting mechanism\u2014imagine if a helicopter rotor rotated forward to become a\npropeller. The BlackFly is unusual: the entire vehicle rears back nearly\nninety degrees and launches like a rocket ship. At about forty feet above the\nground, you bring the machine back to level, and the wings generate lift. It\u2019s\nonly then that the craft starts to look as though it wants to be in the air.\n\nMy first flight instructor was Charlie Bushby, a soft-spoken, bespectacled\nBritish pilot with a genteel accent and a collection of refined loafers. He\nhad actually never flown a BlackFly\u2014he slightly exceeded its size limitations.\nBut, he told me, \u201cover the fortnight you\u2019re with the customer, you take them\non a very unique journey. It\u2019s a dream they\u2019ve always had\u2014to experience\nflight.\u201d The curriculum typically began with the very basics\u2014the use of\nchecklists and the like\u2014but the training was supposed to be a \u201cbespoke, white-\nglove customer experience,\u201d and Bushby wanted to get me into the simulated air\nas quickly as possible.\n\nI assumed the pilot\u2019s chair, put on a virtual-reality headset, and gripped the\njoystick with carnival-booth force. (Bushby noted that aircraft generally\nrespond better to gentle movements than to twitches of terror.) He set the\nsimulator to begin in Central Park and led me through the ignition sequence.\nThe chair pitched back abruptly as I lifted into a hover, then evened out.\nBushby added in a nice tailwind and topped off my battery as I flew south\nthrough midtown, past the abandoned heliport of the old Pan Am Building, and\nthen over the East River in the direction of my apartment, in Brooklyn. It was\nhard not to feel a sense of wonder, peering down over recognizable streets and\nbuildings I\u2019d never seen so closely from above.\n\nNobody is going to be flying himself home from Manhattan anytime soon. For one\nthing, we don\u2019t yet have the ground infrastructure; Thrun thinks that landing\non rooftops, for example, would be a pain. \u201cYou would need the right roof and\nthe right fencing, so kids don\u2019t fall off,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it sounds very\nexpensive.\u201d Regulators would also laugh you out of the room. Operating a\nstandard, nonexperimental aircraft in an urban environment already involves\nmultiple layers of bureaucracy: from the F.A.A., which oversees airspace, and\nfrom municipalities, which oversee the ground. The municipal rules can be\nstrict. Until recently, San Francisco prohibited nearly all helicopters from\nlanding within the city limits. Uri Tzarnotzky, the lead designer at Wisk, one\nof the companies traceable to Page, told me, \u201cThe reality is that people\nreally don\u2019t want everybody to have one of these. If you look at the comments\nsection of the YouTube videos, there\u2019s a mix of NIMBYism and \u2018Have you seen\nhow people drive?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe BlackFly cannot be flown in controlled airspace\u2014near an airport or above a\ncertain altitude\u2014or over congested areas, and it can\u2019t be employed in\ncommercial activities. It can\u2019t even be flown in a strong wind or a light\ndrizzle. Its batteries currently allow for a maximum flight time of about\ntwenty-five minutes, but battery life is not something you want to mess with;\npower is required for a controlled descent. The company\u2019s newest model costs\nabout two hundred thousand dollars. Karklin, Pivotal\u2019s C.E.O., said, of his\ncustomers, \u201cIf I\u2019m going to generalize, they\u2019re white, over fifty, and male.\u201d\nBushby projected that Pivotal\u2019s customer base would represent \u201cplaces with\nsome money and a lot of uncontrolled airspace.\u201d Miami was no good, but maybe\nLouisville.\n\nCartoon by Glen Baxter\n\nLink copied\n\n\u201cAs a business case, don\u2019t underestimate recreation,\u201d Karklin said. \u201cPolaris\nis a multi-billion-dollar company, and they sell snowmobiles.\u201d Some customers\nhave actual use cases in mind. They might, for example, survey their\nvineyards. A customer in central California wants to commute a dozen miles,\nfrom his ranch to his manufacturing plant, and Pivotal\u2019s team had drawn up a\ncourtesy flight plan that wouldn\u2019t endanger his neighbors. Other customers\nwere more ambitious: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a father-daughter superfan team that wanted to\ncross the country twenty minutes at a time.\u201d (The company talked them out of\nit.) Pivotal\u2019s first customer, Tim Lum, lives in Washington\u2019s North Cascades.\nOne of his buddies lived on the next ridge over, a forty-minute walk or a two-\nminute flight. He told me, \u201cMy first few flights, the townspeople or the\nranchers would call the sheriff.\u201d One day, he approached a neighbor who he\nheard was planning to shoot down what the neighbor thought was a surveillance\ndrone: \u201cMy neighbor said, \u2018It\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 I said, \u2018Of course it is.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKarklin readily conceded that the BlackFly was, for the moment, a pleasure\ncraft for the wealthy. But nobody would have looked at the Wright brothers\u2019\nplane at Kitty Hawk and predicted that we\u2019d have a Boeing 707 sixty years\nlater; these new crafts could be just the beginning of a similar sea change in\naviation. \u201cEvery transportation revolution going back to probably the\nchariot\u2014who are the early adopters? People with resources. Who bought the\nfirst cars? People called them \u2018toys for rich people.\u2019 \u201d Karklin continued,\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re Michael Douglas in \u2018Wall Street,\u2019 on the beach with that\ngiant brick of a cell phone.\u201d Leng, for his part, believes that regulatory\nanxieties will ease as people grow habituated to personal flight, just as they\ndid to commercial. Imagine a parallel universe, Leng suggested, where small\nairplanes were the norm: \u201cNow you say, O.K., I want to build a plane for five\nhundred people, it\u2019s going to weigh a million pounds, on takeoff it\u2019s going to\nbe carrying four hundred thousand pounds of highly flammable fuel, and we\u2019re\ngoing to fly it over our biggest cities!\u201d\n\nFor now, Pivotal maintains a degree of gentle paternalism. Karklin told me\nthat the company had been approached by a YouTube influencer wearing a\nskintight flight suit and had given her a \u201csoft no,\u201d suggesting that perhaps a\nfuture model would better meet her needs. The company anonymously monitors all\ncustomer usage and is prepared to ground customers who damage the aircraft or\nget edgy with battery capacity.\n\nMy childlike delight persisted in the simulator until I encountered virtual-\nreality nausea, first gradual and then sudden. But there was no time to lie on\nthe carpet. The BlackFly\u2019s flight controls are intuitive\u2014like a relatively\nsimple video game\u2014but the stakes are high, and the cognitive load is\nconsiderable. Motor temperatures and battery levels must be monitored\nconstantly, lest the vehicle experience what is politely referred to as\n\u201cuncontrolled descent into terrain.\u201d As these thresholds near, the craft\nbecomes agitated, with dinging alarms and colored alerts: yellow, or land\nsoon; red, or land immediately; and purple, or pull the red knob to activate\nthe whole-craft parachute. Nobody has ever pulled the red knob. The company\u2019s\nbest guess is that it doesn\u2019t really help below about a hundred and sixty\nfeet. My own flight was not supposed to exceed a hundred and ten. They\nnevertheless had to insure that I knew how to pull the red knob.\n\nThe BlackFly lands the same way it takes off, by tilting back nearly ninety\ndegrees to induce drag, in the manner of a descending pigeon. This position\nmakes it difficult for the pilot to see the ground below. In my attempt to set\ndown gently in Prospect Park\u2019s Long Meadow, I smashed into a large tree.\nBushby, apparently unperturbed, was optimistic: \u201cMaybe one day you really\ncould be flying this over New York.\u201d For the next three days, I arrived early\nto practice. I was drilled in how to recover from the loss of various\ninstruments\u2014G.P.S., altimeter\u2014and what to do if a joystick failed. (The\nprotocol for the loss of the right joystick is to trigger the left joystick;\nthe protocol for the loss of both joysticks is to hope it never happens.) At\nthe end of the final simulator day, I was tested by the chief flight\ninstructor, an Army veteran named Rob Dreer, who flew drones in Afghanistan\nand Iraq. After three hours, Dreer cleared me for my first actual flight. He\ngrew solemn, as if he were sending me into battle. He had seen photos of my\nchildren. \u201cThe true milestone of being a real pilot is being up there by\nyourself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll experience that tomorrow\u2014being a true aviator.\u201d\nThen he set the simulator location to Yosemite, where I let my anxiety drain\noff in slow, serene loops between Half Dome and El Capitan.\n\nAlthough advanced air mobility in America is heavily concentrated in Silicon\nValley, the tacit industry motto seems to be \u201cMove slowly and break nothing.\u201d\nThere are a variety of more or less measured approaches to the aerial transit\nof the future, and a company called Beta Technologies has decided to focus\nfirst on cargo logistics and military applications, sectors in which eVTOL\noperations can be refined without the need to build additional infrastructure\nor to convince passengers to come on board. On a cold, overcast day in\nJanuary, I met Beta\u2019s C.E.O., Kyle Clark, at the company\u2019s research-and-\ndevelopment facility, in a renovated hangar in South Burlington, Vermont.\nClark is tall, restless, and rangy\u2014a \u201clanky-ass bastard,\u201d he called\nhimself\u2014with a tattooed band on his ring finger. The F.A.A. requires that\nplanes accommodate all passenger sizes from the fifth percentile of women to\nthe ninety-fifth percentile of men, but Beta had to extend the latter to the\nninety-ninth percentile for Clark. \u201cRight now, we operate in this two-\ndimensional world,\u201d Clark told me. \u201cEven a commercial flight going three\nthousand miles at thirty-two thousand feet, that\u2019s horizontal, for all intents\nand purposes. And we\u2019re going to go ahead and add a whole other dimension to\nwhere you can be and go? The whole thing\u2014how can it not be really intriguing?\u201d\n\nWhen Clark was a kid, all he wanted to do was fly. Every birthday and\nChristmas, he requested an airplane. His parents were unusually permissive,\nbut, when an adolescent Clark started building an ultralight in his garage,\nhis mother set the parts on fire. She drew the line at D.I.Y. aviation. As a\njunior at Harvard, in 2001, Clark left to play hockey for the Washington\nCapitals. He spent his signing bonus on flight training. When he returned to\ncollege, a few years later, he won the engineering department\u2019s prize for his\nthesis, a plan for an aircraft that a pilot could guide with body pressure;\nultimately, he envisioned a flying motorcycle that you could drive out of the\nairport. When he sold his first company, which made power electronics, he\nbought a Cessna and a partially assembled kit aircraft, which he completed\nhimself.\n\nIn 2017, Martine Rothblatt, the founder of a biotechnology company, told Clark\nthat she needed an environmentally friendly, cost-efficient way to move organs\nbetween medical facilities. He rushed over to the Burlington airport and\narranged to rent an office. Not long after, the airport leased him a derelict\nhangar where snow-removal equipment was being stored. His team, then made up\nof eight people, had to invent and manufacture its own parts. Such is the\nforce of Clark\u2019s personality that he and his team finished an eVTOL prototype\nin ten months. In an initial funding round, the company raised three hundred\nand sixty-eight million dollars. \u201cEvery day, I say that there are two things\nthat\u2019ll put us out of business\u2014running out of money and killing people in our\nplanes,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re doing everything we can to insure that won\u2019t\nhappen.\u201d Beta now has more than six hundred employees, most of whom seem to\nhave wandered in from a dog park outside a microbrewery. One of the company\u2019s\npilots, who flew me in the chase plane that accompanies their aircraft for\nobservation, was previously a local pizza-delivery guy who moonlighted as a\nflight instructor. From the beginning, Clark wanted his engineers to know how\nto fly\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s different to design landing gear when you\u2019re the one flying the\nplane\u201d\u2014so he hired a retired fighter pilot as an in-house teacher. The\ndecision was canny, morale-wise. \u201cWhen people get the bug and love flying,\ntheir passion drives them harder than any perks or bonuses,\u201d he said. One\nemployee told me that, in his first interview, Clark taught him how to fly a\nhelicopter.\n\nThe drive from South Burlington to Beta\u2019s facilities in Plattsburgh, New York,\nis about an hour and a half and includes a ferry ride. It\u2019s also a twelve-\nminute flight. It was what Clark unironically described as a \u201cbeautiful day\u201d\nin January\u2014freezing temperatures under a gunmetal sky. We climbed into the\ncompany\u2019s 1967 Cessna, and, as we ascended, I withdrew my phone to record the\npatterns of fractured ice on Lake Champlain below. \u201cSee? If we were in a car,\nI bet you wouldn\u2019t be taking pictures,\u201d he said. The airstrip on the far shore\nstretched out before us, and Clark came in for a low, slow descent. As he\ntouched down, he made sure that I registered his relaxed achievement: \u201cThat\nwas a no-flap landing, by the way.\u201d\n\nClark\u2019s team was busying itself in a whitewashed Cold War-era hangar. Its\neVTOL, called Alia, is vaguely based on the skeleton of an Arctic tern, with a\nfishbowl cockpit. To me, it looked immaculate, but Clark said, \u201cCould\u2019ve\ncleaned the fucking bugs off the windscreen.\u201d UPS had already ordered as many\nas a hundred and fifty of the vehicles, which it planned to use for its\n\u201cmiddle mile\u201d routes, between distribution centers and warehouses. Other\npotential customers showed an immediate interest in a conventional-takeoff\nversion, which in any case was going to be easier to certify, so the team\nbuilt a near-identical second model without lift propellers. Clark\u2019s pitch was\nnot only about sustainability. Electric motors run at much lower temperatures\nand show less performance wear. Electric aircraft are orders of magnitude\ncheaper to fly, and they will improve over time as higher-capacity batteries\nare swapped in. Like helicopters, they can also land pretty much anywhere, but\nat a fraction of the cost and with less of a din. Certain drones are already\nbeing used to transport blood and medical supplies in parts of sub-Saharan\nAfrica where there are few roads, but you can\u2019t put a doctor, or hundreds of\npounds of medical equipment, in them.\n\nCharlie Bushby, one of Pivotal\u2019s instructors, uses its flight simulator.\n\nClark told me that he also recently signed a contract with the U.S. Air Force,\nworth up to a hundred million dollars. Electric vehicles could make forward\noperations less reliant on fuel supply lines. The Pentagon recently spent more\nthan ten billion dollars in a year on fuel alone. A study found that more than\nhalf of the American casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan were in fuel or water\nconvoys, not actual battles. One National Guard officer sketched for me a\nvision of a decentralized Pacific theatre in which electric vehicles could\n\u201crefuel\u201d with solar panels on remote islands. Vertical takeoff and landing\ncould be used for the transfer of supplies to far-flung places without\nairstrips. The military recently tested Beta\u2019s craft in a simulated casualty\nevacuation and found that sixteen hundred dollars of fuel could be replaced by\nfive dollars of electricity.\n\nBack in the Cessna, Clark turned to me and said, \u201cYou take the controls now.\u201d\nI put my feet on the pedals and practiced some rudder movements as we turned\nonto the runway, where he instructed me to throttle up a bit. As we reached\ntakeoff speed, he coached me to lift the nose, and I could feel the wings bite\ninto the air. He directed me into a banking right, but in my exhilaration I\nmay have pushed our angle of attack into dangerous territory. \u201cUm, maybe nose\ndown a little before we stall there,\u201d he said. He asked if I wanted to fly the\nrest of the way back, and land, but I happily gave up the controls. He still\nthought we all deserved to experience personal flight, but he acknowledged the\nscale of the challenge. When he first raised money for the company, he told\nme, \u201cthere was all this social pressure to do the obvious thing\u2014to hop over\ntraffic\u2014and we thought about doing that, but we\u2019re pragmatists about the way\nto get there.\u201d He added, \u201cWe do believe we\u2019ll get to urban air mobility.\u201d As\nwe crossed back over the small bays where he used to play hockey, he peered\ndown to examine them. \u201cIf it were late February, I\u2019d offer to land on the\nice.\u201d He smiled as he thought it over. \u201cWell, it\u2019s probably safe if we needed\nto,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I guess we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe world wasn\u2019t quite ready for Larry Page\u2019s original vision of a personal\ncraft that could land in a parking space, but his efforts ultimately coalesced\nin the form of a company called Wisk, now a subsidiary of Boeing. Wisk, along\nwith its rivals Joby and Archer, settled on an air-taxi model. Wisk\u2019s design\nemploys rotors that operate vertically for lift and then tilt horizontally for\nthrust. (This is the architecture used by the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, which\nwas recently cleared to fly again after being grounded in the wake of several\nfatal crashes.) The company\u2019s current craft, called Cora, has an average speed\nof about a hundred and forty miles an hour and a range of about a hundred\nmiles. The company\u2019s design shop is in the Bay Area, in a cul-de-sac behind\nPivotal. When I visited, last year, Wisk employees showed me a prototype of\ntheir newest model, which seated four passengers. With a bulky fuselage\npainted a blinding shade of yellow, the vehicle looked like a miniature school\nbus. Tzarnotzky, the Wisk designer\u2014a large, thoughtful man with the aspect of\na plush bear\u2014told me, \u201cOur competitors have a dark, exclusive branding that\u2019s\nsupposed to communicate a jet-set life style. People have criticized this for\nlooking like a minivan with wings\u2014but that\u2019s a good thing! You want Grandma in\nthe minivan, not in the thrill ride.\u201d\n\nThe air-taxi idea goes like this: you book your trip through an app; you\nstroll a few blocks to the closest vertiport (an existing helipad for now,\nwhile municipalities or contractors construct new infrastructure); you stow\nyour bag in the \u201cfrunk,\u201d climb in, and fasten your seat belt tight across your\nlap; the taxi ascends in a hover, transitions to forward flight, and joins a\nzippy procession of other craft along an established aerial corridor, probably\none that follows a highway below. They will almost certainly be used first for\ntransit to airports or for local tourism\u2014to reach offshore islands, say. If\nthis sounds like the democratization of the helicopter, it is. \u201cThere\u2019s a\nreason a lot of this is focussed on Los Angeles,\u201d David King, a professor at\nArizona State University who studies transportation, told me. \u201cThe reason Kobe\nBryant flew around in helicopters was because he was rich, but the other\nreason a fairly high share of rich people in L.A. are already getting around\nby helicopter is because up until a decade ago all skyscrapers there had to be\nflat on top, for helipads.\u201d\n\nWhat differentiates Wisk from its competitors is the absence of a pilot. More\nthan half of the company\u2019s team flies their own planes; on sunny Saturdays,\nthey have a club that meets for what hobbyist pilots like to call a \u201chundred-\ndollar burger.\u201d But Wisk\u2019s business-model calculations suggested that pilots\ndo not pencil out\u2014they add weight, require training, and typically insist on a\nsalary. Also, there aren\u2019t nearly enough of them, and a discount pilot is much\nworse than no pilot at all. Planes already do about ninety per cent of the\nflying themselves. Even if most commercial passengers are aware, on an\nintellectual level, that the skilled but underutilized pilots in the cockpit\nare mostly being paid to drink coffee, the idea of fully autonomous flight\nwill require some acculturation. When I took a seat in a full-scale mockup of\nWisk\u2019s prototype, a soothing video displayed my proposed flight path. A\nsupervisor on the ground oversees the flight and can intervene if necessary.\nThe display consoled me with the prospect of communicating with a \u201cremote\nhospitality crew.\u201d\n\nIn the long run, these companies imagine a world of aerial commuters.\nAccording to a Deloitte report, air-taxi services would be three to five times\nfaster than existing ground transit. Over time, we might free up resources\ndedicated to decaying roads and bridges in favor of streams of evenly spaced\naircraft proceeding overhead. Despite the metropolitan \u201cBlade Runner\u201d allure\nof this vision, Cyrus Sigari, the prominent investor, told me, \u201cThe suburban\nand rural use cases are way more relevant and easier to address\u201d than flying\ntaxis within cities. In theory, it would be possible to live in Scranton or\nBinghamton and make it to New York City in half an hour. David King, the\nArizona State professor, noted, \u201cAir-taxi routes could help rejuvenate some\nrural economies, if the cost was such that you could legitimately live ninety\nto a hundred miles away from your work.\u201d Matthew Clarke, the engineering\npostdoc, told me that, as someone from a minority background, he tends to be\nskeptical of shiny technocratic solutions, but he sees something real here.\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to janitors from Stockton, people who spend a lot of money on gas\nevery day to commute for hours, who could take a short flight from Stockton\nAirport to Palo Alto Airport. Instead of waking up at 4 a.m., they could wake\nup at 7 a.m.\u201d (Alternatively, the Bay Area could build more housing.)\n\nWisk has a tentative agreement with the Council of Mayors of South East\nQueensland, Australia, which is hoping to offer Wisk services to tourists and\nlocals in time for the Brisbane Olympics, in 2032. My visit to Wisk coincided\nwith the arrival of a delegation of Australian officials, who had come to\nwatch a test flight at a rural airport. Adrian Schrinner, the ruddy, thick-\nnecked Lord Mayor of Brisbane, swept his hand over his brilliantined hair and\ntold me that he\u2019d volunteer to take the first passenger flight. (His P.R.\nperson leaned over and said, in a stage whisper, \u201cThe Deputy Lord Mayor is\nquite O.K. with that!\u201d) We stood in a light rain at the end of the runway and\nwatched Cora take off in a sibilant hover. At about a hundred feet, the\naircraft shifted to horizontal flight. The moment of transition drew muted\nawe, but once in flight it just looked like a little airplane\u2014although a\npassenger alone inside would presumably have felt otherwise. By the end of the\ndemo, most of the mayors were glancing down at their phones, trying to figure\nout if the videos they took were impressive. Jim Tighe, Wisk\u2019s C.T.O., told me\nthat he hopes to see this sort of behavior among customers in the air, too:\n\u201cWhen people get out their phones and doomscroll during a flight, I think, I\nreally nailed it!\u201d\n\nAt Wisk\u2019s offices, Schrinner told me that air taxis could one day connect\nremote Indigenous communities to urban hospitals, or sightseers to the Bay\nIslands. \u201cIt\u2019s only eighty kilometres from Brisbane to the Gold Coast,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cIt should only take an hour by car, but on a busy weekend it can take\ntwo.\u201d Out of curiosity, I asked how long public transit takes. He paused\nbefore admitting that he didn\u2019t know. But in a Wisk it might take as little as\nfifteen minutes. He picked up a toy model of Cora and said, \u201cAt back-yard\nbarbecues, people tell me, \u2018This is far-fetched, we\u2019ve heard about flying cars\nfor decades.\u2019 But we saw it this morning, and it\u2019s not a pie in the sky. I\ntell them, \u2018It will happen.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPeople in the industry tend to think that flight is useful and awesome, and\nnot necessarily in that order. One of the reasons that the idea of flying cars\nhas endured is that it seems to promise two different kinds of freedom: on the\none hand, to get from point A to point B without a lot of hassle; on the other\nhand, to know the euphoria of exploring the third dimension. Most people at\nthese companies got into the business because they were personally enraptured\nby flight. They are nonetheless well aware that airplanes and automobiles have\nvastly different requirements, and that the vision of a car that both drives\nand flies never made a ton of sense. An inventor and professor named Paul\nMoller spent four decades working on his Skycar, believing for years that it\nwas just within reach. In 2009, as the modern industry was starting, he went\nbankrupt. For a period, a company called ASKA had a mockup of a flying car in\na window display in downtown Los Altos, California; members of its \u201cFounders\nClub,\u201d who paid a five-thousand-dollar deposit to get on the preorder list for\nan eight-hundred-thousand-dollar vehicle, were entitled to customize their\naircraft\u2019s design. Today, the storefront is vacant. (The company says it\u2019s\nlooking for a bigger showroom.) Soberer parties now understand that you have\nto make trade-offs between the breathtaking and the handy. During one of my\nvisits to Wisk, I was inadvertently shown a set of talking points that\nemployees had been given. Their comments were to be restricted to observations\n\u201cgrounded in reality/today,\u201d and they were instructed to \u201cavoid making bold\nclaims that cannot be backed up with data/proof.\u201d Beta was even reluctant to\nbe portrayed as building anything like a flying car.\n\n\u201cA revolutionary war was brewing, but I managed to turn it into a culture\nwar.\u201d\n\nCartoon by Adam Douglas Thompson\n\nLink copied\n\nOne company already has a deal with United to start air-taxi services to\nNewark Airport next year, but such deals remain highly provisional: a German\nstartup planned to fly passengers at this summer\u2019s Paris Olympics, until\nEuropean regulators quashed the idea. Dubai seems poised to begin offering\nservices; China\u2019s regulatory body just approved the mass production of an\neVTOL for commercial use. But for such plans to become a widespread reality,\nlet alone the future of transport, regulatory agencies will have to be coaxed\ninto an overhaul of the way that airspace is structured and administered. We\nwould need foolproof, digital detect-and-avoid systems to prevent collisions.\neVTOLs might not be helicopter loud, but they are noisy. Engineers think that\nthis issue can eventually be ameliorated, but, if it can\u2019t, no one will be\nhappy with an insistent mosquito buzz in the background. And then there\u2019s the\nsheer number that would be needed. Before the pandemic, about four hundred\nthousand people a day crossed the Hudson River into Manhattan. Aerial\ncommuting would require tens of thousands of drone taxis operating on regular,\nreliable schedules, with flawless safety records. David King told me, \u201cSo all\nof a sudden you\u2019re into the realm of, \u2018Why didn\u2019t we just build a train?\u2019 \u201d\n\nMost responsible urban planners believe that public transit is a political\nproblem, not a technological one. The tools to improve urban mobility\u2014trains,\ntrams, bicycles, sidewalks\u2014have been around for a long time. The issue isn\u2019t\nthat we were promised flying cars and got a hundred and forty characters; it\u2019s\nour attachment to a nostalgic kind of gizmo-first futurism, one that speaks to\na profound failure of the national imagination. There\u2019s something a little\ndismal about the fact that the mid-century dream of the future might, if\neverything goes perfectly according to plan, come to fruition in the form of\nsaving half an hour en route to J.F.K. Then again, that isn\u2019t too far from the\ninitial vision. In an age of abundance, the promise of the future sold to\naffluent suburbanites was one of ever-greater consumer ease. George Jetson was\nnot dizzyingly free; he had a flying car that folded up into a briefcase, and\nhe used it to get to work quickly.\n\nAlmost everyone in the industry thinks that personal aerial vehicles will\narrive eventually\u2014maybe in twenty years, maybe in fifty. If they do, it will\nbe through a series of gradual changes\u2014the kind of thing that can look, to the\nuntrained eye, like stagnation. Peter Thiel and J. Storrs Hall seem to find it\nalmost personally insulting that jets look just like they did in the sixties.\nBut Brian Yutko, a former Boeing executive who is now Wisk\u2019s C.E.O., told me,\n\u201cThat\u2019s so off base. Do the airplanes largely look the same if you\u2019re a four-\nyear-old holding up two pictures? Yes, but they\u2019re actually pretty different.\nThey got seventy per cent more fuel-efficient, they have a much longer range,\nand safety incidents have been driven as close to zero as possible.\u201d He\ncontinued, \u201cThat\u2019s technological progress that took human ingenuity for five\nor six decades. Other sectors should learn from that! It\u2019s not stagnation,\nit\u2019s \u2018How did you do that?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLast fall, I joined Wisk\u2019s team in New Zealand, where it was participating in\nan \u201cairspace integration test\u201d\u2014a pioneering attempt to introduce unmanned\nflights into an area with commercial planes and other air traffic. New Zealand\nhas a lot of empty sky, crashes pose a risk largely to sheep, and the\ncountry\u2019s regulatory agencies have been hospitable to experimentation. The\ntests took place about twenty miles south of Christchurch, on a thin, dusty\nisthmus called the Kaitorete Spit. The airfield there is a joint venture with\nlocal Maori councils, who named it T\u0101whaki, for a god who gathered knowledge\nfrom the heavens and brought it back to earth.\n\nOne design for early automobiles, known as Horsey Horseless, featured an\nartificial horse head mounted on the front of the chassis, so that it would\nresemble something familiar to other horses on the road. Wisk took a similar\napproach in the test. It was using a Boeing drone that was not being flown\nautonomously but by pilots in regular communication with air-traffic control;\nthe pilots simply happened to be on the ground rather than in the cockpit.\nThis was quite a big step for commercial aviation, in which virtually all\nprocedures are based around the presence of an onboard pilot, but the\naccomplishment was buried under a barrage of bureaucratic acronyms: they hoped\nto do B.V.L.O.S. for an R.P.A. under I.F.R. conditions in C.T.A. One employee,\nwho had come to Wisk from a jet-pack startup, told me that \u201ca scaled-up U.A.M.\noperation would saturate the existing system within minutes.\u201d U.A.M. means\n\u201curban air mobility,\u201d and what they were doing here, he continued, was laying\nthe groundwork for a P.S.U.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a P.S.U.?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cA provider of services for U.A.M.,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s an acronym\nwithin an acronym.\u201d\n\nThe pilots, dressed in vintage patterned fleeces and heavy work boots, were\ncamped in the rear of a ground-control trailer. They were confident that their\nvehicle\u2019s path would be even more precise and reliable than that of a standard\ncraft. It was launched with the faint snow cover of the Southern Alps in the\ndistance, and it climbed in a tight spiral to twenty-five hundred feet before\nthe pilots requested clearance to enter controlled airspace. The reply came\nover the radio: \u201cYou are identified and cleared.\u201d To a civilian, it wasn\u2019t\neasy to tell what the fuss was all about. Aviators, however, knew better.\nBoeing\u2019s regional executive, who had come to make a bottle-breaking\nappearance, declared it an \u201cenormous milestone for aviation.\u201d\n\nByron Airport is an uncontrolled airfield about forty miles east of the Bay\nArea. On the morning that I arrived, the winds were calm, at about three knots\nfrom the east, with scattered cloud cover at thirteen thousand feet. Mt.\nDiablo was visible in the haze, and the windmilled hillsides, freshened by a\nweek of rain, were a deep green. Wyatt Warner, Pivotal\u2019s chief test engineer,\nhauled a BlackFly on a trailer to a small landing pad, which made a sucking\nsound in the mud. We waited for a planeload of skydivers, who bloomed against\nthe gray cloud cover, to finish their descent. Then Warner took off in the\nBlackFly for a nine-minute test flight. His flight was elegant, though the\ncraft still looked as if it didn\u2019t want to be in the air\u2014like a tractor having\na nightmare. Allison King, a mechanical engineer who was monitoring flight\ndata, told me that she\u2019d come across Pivotal\u2019s Web site shortly after\ngraduating from M.I.T. \u201cI thought, Well, that\u2019s just C.G.I.,\u201d she said. \u201cThen\nI looked at the disclaimer that said, \u2018This is not C.G.I.,\u2019 and I was, like,\n\u2018Wait, what?\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen Warner returned, Charlie Bushby, my first flight instructor, said, \u201cYou\nknow what that means?\u201d They gave me a flight suit with a smart BlackFly patch.\nWarner, watching the jumpers, was reminded of an old joke: \u201cThe good thing\nabout when your parachute doesn\u2019t open is that you have the rest of your life\nto solve the problem.\u201d Idle conversation turned to plane-crash survival: a\nSerbian flight attendant who fell from thirty-three thousand feet and lived;\nthose who walked away from the 1999 crash in Sioux City. We spoke about a\nlocal test pilot who had worked for Beta and interviewed at Pivotal; he had\ndied weeks before in a tragic kit-plane crash. Bushby said, \u201cPerhaps let\u2019s not\ntalk about this right now?\u201d\n\nThe BlackFly was used in what may have been the first manned flight of an\neVTOL.\n\nWith a clipboard checklist strapped to my thigh, I climbed up into the vehicle\nand slid the plexiglass canopy over my head. I turned the propellers on,\ntested the controls, and then initiated the takeoff sequence. My first flight\nwas a simple hover\u2014up and then down. The propellers began to spin with the\nsound of leaf blowers, the craft reared back, and I was wrenched upward,\npinned to my seat, heart hammering. Warner had instructed me to breathe, but\nmy body sent only lurching reminders that flight is wrong. I hung there just\nlong enough to steal a hurried glance in each direction, then thumbed the\ntoggle to descend. In what felt like both an instant and an eternity, I was\nback on the ground. We let the craft rest for ten minutes before my second\ntest flight, which involved flying in a small box pattern over the landing\npad. The flight plan meant a long interval in pure hover, and while I was\nairborne my motor temperatures quickly hit a hundred and twenty degrees. The\nyellow warning lights flashed; although I wasn\u2019t perfectly centered over the\npad, this seemed like a good time to land, which I did, with a little skid\ninto the mud. I hopped out, and Warner and I dragged the BlackFly back to the\nproper takeoff spot.\n\nI was now ready, they told me, to fly for real. As I took off into a hover, I\ntwisted the stick to the right, turning away from everyone below, and lit out\nin the direction of the hills. Once I levelled off, the propellers quieted to\na much softer hum, and all at once I had a feeling of lightness and agility in\nthe air. Below me were muddy ponds, glistening patterns of water and grass, a\ncluster of black cows. I crested through a long, slow turn over the base of\nthe foothills, and the machine felt alive to my touch. The company had\ndisabled cruise mode, limiting me to an airspeed of about thirty miles an\nhour\u2014something they said they\u2019d done to prevent me from accidentally slipping\ninto higher gear. But I knew now that, if cruise weren\u2019t disabled, I would\nhave pushed the craft to whatever speed was available to me; I would have\nflown in the direction of the hills and the sky and never come back; I would\nbe up there still. There was the sense that the vibrating craft was an\nextension of my limbs. It was no wonder that the disembodied march of software\nhad left so many technologists longing for the experience of living inside the\ncircuitry. Entirely forgotten was the banality of commuting to work. The\ndelirium of flight was enough. I glanced at my viewscreen, began the slow,\ngradual descent I\u2019d practiced on the simulators, and, with great reluctance,\ntriggered the sequence to land. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the April 22 & 29, 2024, issue, with the\nheadline \u201cFlight of Fancy.\u201d\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Why facts don\u2019t change our minds.\n\n  * The tricks rich people use to avoid taxes.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * How did polyamory get so popular?\n\n  * The ghostwriter who regrets working for Donald Trump.\n\n  * Snoozers are, in fact, losers.\n\n  * Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: \u201cGirl\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nGideon Lewis-Kraus is a staff writer at The New Yorker.
