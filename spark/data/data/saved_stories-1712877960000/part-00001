An interview with\nMatthew Weiner, creator of the television series Mad Men. A Science article\ntitled \u201cThe question of animal emotions.\u201d Google Scholar. This was my answer\nto economist Tyler Cowen and tech entrepreneur Daniel Gross\u2019s current favorite\ninterview question from their new book Talent: \u201cWhat are the open tabs in your\nbrowser right now?\u201d The authors contend that this question captures a person\u2019s\nintellectual habits, level of curiosity, and how he or she spends her free\ntime, all at once. In other words, the answer provides a direct insight into a\nperson\u2019s demonstrated preferences.\n\nTalent presents new insights into the process of hiring. The book is thorough\nyet breezy, providing useful tips for how to develop a talent-spotting mindset\nwith insights from psychometrics, management, economics, and sociology, among\nother disciplines.\n\nTalent search, of course, is not just about hiring for jobs. It also involves\ndecisions about who should get scholarships, auditions, athletic positions,\nand co-authorships. The authors note that the challenge of talent search isn\u2019t\nrelevant only for the selectors but also for those who hope to be selected.\nJust about everyone is involved, either hoping to identify talent in others or\nshow off their own. If you hope to be \u201cchosen,\u201d then it\u2019s useful to learn what\nothers are thinking about talent in order to exhibit the desired qualities.\n\nThe ability to pinpoint talent is more important than ever. Cowen and Gross\nnote that in the U.S., from 1980 to 2000, the main cause of income inequality\nwas whether a person graduated from college. But from 2000 to 2017, income\ninequality primarily existed within educational groupings. In other words,\ntalent appears to be more responsible than education for economic returns.\n\nCowen and Gross each describe how often they reject proposals, and they\nconclude that \u201ctalent and not money is the truly scarce variable.\u201d But where\ndoes it come from? They acknowledge that talent can differ between\nindividuals, but they also stress the importance of practice. Indeed, those\nwith the potential to cultivate serious talent sometimes practice to the point\nof obsession. Discussing which attributes predict eminence in a field,\npsychology professor David Lubinski has said that passion for work is key, and\nthat highly creative people tend to be \u201calmost myopically\u201d fixated on work.\n\nRelatedly, Cowen and Gross observe, \u201cIf you are hiring a writer, look for\nsigns that the person is writing literally every day. If you are hiring an\nexecutive, try to discern what they are doing all the time to improve\nnetworking, decision-making, and knowledge of the sectors they work in.\u201d\nDeveloping the habit of practice and self-discipline\u2014the authors describe it\nas \u201csturdiness\u201d\u2014is critical for talent acquisition. \u201cSturdiness is the quality\nof getting work done every day, with extreme regularity and without long\nstreaks of non-achievement,\u201d they write. \u201cIf you are a writer, sturdiness is a\nvery powerful virtue, even if you do not always feel you are being extremely\nproductive.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the book cites research indicating that perseverance is a\nstronger predictor than passion for success. When it comes to achievement,\npersistence pays off more than pure passion.\n\nThe authors\u2019 favorite interview question about browser tabs is meant to tap\ninto this question about whether a person spends his or her free time\npracticing. What the book describes as \u201cdowntime revealed preferences\u201d are\nmore interesting than \u201cstories about your prior jobs.\u201d For instance, asking\nwhat newsletters or subreddits a person reads is often more illuminating than\nasking what a person did at their previous job.\n\nThe book is very much about identifying high performers, as opposed to average\nworkers. This is particularly true of its interview section, which gives\nguidance on unstructured, as opposed to structured, interviews. Most research\nindicates that interviews are more effective for higher-level jobs.\n\nTalent provides several fascinating questions designed to yield interesting\nanswers. How did you prepare for this interview? What\u2019s a story one of your\nreferences might tell me when I call them? Which of your beliefs are you most\nlikely wrong about? Whether the candidate can draw on intellectual and\nemotional resources to answer is a sign of broader stores of intellect and\nenergy that he or she will bring to the job. The authors suggest that\ninterviewers should not be afraid to let a question hang in the air after\nasking it; better to hold the tension to make clear you expect an answer.\n\nThe authors suggest using challenging and unusual questions to identify those\nwith more style than substance. As they put it, \u201cBeware of verbally adept\nstorytellers.\u201d Most of us have a bias toward well-spoken and articulate\nindividuals. Bear this in mind, for it can lead you to hire what the authors\ndescribe as \u201cglib but unsubstantial people.\u201d They conclude this line of advice\nwith, \u201cDo not overestimate the importance of a person\u2019s articulateness.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the statistician and philosopher Nassim Taleb has suggested that\ncharisma and appearance should be held against an individual when weighing\nmerits. In his bestselling book Skin in the Game, Taleb contrasts two\nsuccessful surgeons who hold a similar rank in a hospital: a well-groomed\ndoctor with an Ivy League diploma, and another who \u201clooks like a butcher,\u201d\nwith an unkempt appearance and uncouth speech.\n\nWho should you choose as your surgeon? Taleb suggests the latter. This is\nbecause a successful surgeon who does not look like a surgeon but manages to\nattain a high rank indicates that he had more to overcome. In contrast,\nsomeone who looks and speaks the part may be held to lower standards when it\ncomes to ability.\n\nA useful example of this happens in season 6 of the television series Mad Men.\nDr. Arnold Rosen, a relatively plain man, tells the tall and handsome\nprotagonist, Don Draper, \u201cIf I looked like you and talked like that, I\nwouldn\u2019t have had to go to medical school.\u201d Don, who didn\u2019t graduate from\ncollege, responds with a restrained smile.\n\nThis is perhaps why training for prestigious professions has become so\nburdensome: so that even those who could get by on looks alone must undergo an\narduous process designed to weed out the undedicated. \u201cMany high-status\nprofessions, such as medicine, law, and academia, put younger performers\nthrough brutal stamina tests in the early years of their career . . . if we\nmeet an individual who exhibits stamina, we immediately upgrade the chance of\nthat person having a major impact,\u201d Cowen and Gross write.\n\nHigh-status occupations are often extremely demanding, in part to select\nagainst people who are more interested in prestige than in the profession\nitself. The authors note that those who tend to do especially well in their\ncareers prioritize improving their craft above other motives, such as the\npursuit of prestige. In one of many unique insights throughout the book, Cowen\nand Gross provide a \u201cquick window\u201d into whether a person is more interested in\nideas or obtaining social status. They state that in a group setting, \u201cstatus-\nseekers focus on maximizing attention from the perceived elite. Idea-seekers,\non the other hand, want to advance knowledge and stimulate curiosity.\u201d\n\nAnother way of measuring time allocation and actual behavior is \u201cspeed of\nresponse.\u201d The authors state that highly ambitious and successful people tend\nto be very responsive to emails. This picks up on \u201chow much the individual is\nfocused on being connected to the world and responding to plausibly important\nqueries.\u201d\n\nWhat other traits lead to success? The authors dedicate a chapter to\npersonality and its relationship with talent. They write, \u201cPersonality and\nconscientiousness matter most at the bottom of the distribution . . . in the\nbottom tenth of earners, non-cognitive skills\u2014which include, for instance,\nfeatures of personality\u2014matters two and a half to four times more than do\ncognitive skills.\u201d In other words, hard work is more important for unskilled\nworkers than for skilled workers, suggesting that cultivating a work ethic may\nin some cases be more important than trying to boost academic ability.\n\nConscientiousness\u2014a personality trait marked by a concern with order and a\nwillingness to work hard\u2014is also a predictor of occupational success. For\ninstance, a one-standard-deviation increase in conscientiousness is associated\nwith a 7.2 percent wage boost.\n\nNeuroticism\u2014a personality trait encompassing a proneness to anxiety,\ndepression, and irritability\u2014often has the opposite effect. A one-standard-\ndeviation increase in neuroticism is associated with 3.6 percent lower wages.\nPeople high in this trait are often unhappy with their occupational positions,\nthe authors say. \u201cThere is an entire class of highly credentialed, fairly\ntalented individuals who spend their whole lives hopping from one job to\nanother, restless, never happy, and never able to put down any roots . . .\nmost of the time you should avoid them.\u201d But neuroticism can be useful in some\ninstances. As Cowen and Gross note, \u201cIf you are looking to hire a crusader on\nbehalf of a social justice cause, someone who will notice injustices and then\ncomplain about them, neuroticism might be a desirable trait.\u201d\n\nThe book also indicates that the same traits that make people unpleasant also\nlead them to make breakthrough discoveries. For example, \u201ceminent scientists\nare more likely to be dominant, arrogant, hostile, and self-confident compared\nto scientists as a whole. They are also more flexible in thought and behavior\nthan scientists of lesser laurels.\u201d\n\nStill, using personality as a predictor of success has its limitations.\nPsychologists can\u2019t necessarily forecast when and in what circumstances\ncertain personality traits will be expressed. The authors offer the example of\nnovelist Vikram Seth, who stated that he wrote his masterpiece A Suitable Boy\nbecause he did not have enough conscientiousness to finish his economics Ph.D.\nat Stanford.\n\nLater in the book, Cowen and Gross step outside the confines of academic\nresearch on intelligence and personality theory and offer more speculative\nsuggestions for spotting talent. For instance, \u201cDoes the person have an\nobsession with continual self-improvement?\u201d Focus on whether the person is\ngrowing in dynamism, maturity, stamina, intellect, and so on. The amount and\nrate of change will tell the interviewer whether the individual is worth\ntaking a chance on.\n\nAnother indicator of potential talent is knowing \u201chow to perceive and climb\nthe right hierarchies,\u201d which the authors call \u201cone of the most stringent but\nalso most universal tests available.\u201d Additionally, one should pay attention\nto the number of conceptual frameworks or mental models a person has at his or\nher disposal. How good a person is at understanding different cultural and\nintellectual frameworks and applying them to different contexts often signals\na wellspring of talent. In fact, the ability to collect mental frameworks in\nitself is useful for spotting and managing talent, as it enables you to\npinpoint special qualities that others overlook.\n\nThe book contains chapters on how to spot talent among those with\ndisabilities, as well as women and ethnic minorities. For instance, the\nauthors suggest that some of what appears to be discrimination against women\nis actually discrimination against individuals with relatively lower\nconfidence. Men are more prone than women to project self-assuredness, which\nmay account for some of the earnings differences in higher job positions.\nRegarding ADHD, the authors highlight how \u201ca pretty high proportion of\nsuccessful individuals seem to be ADHD in some manner\u201d and that such\nindividuals \u201chave learned to redirect their cognitive impatience as a force\nthat propels them through an enormous amount of work and learning.\u201d\n\nThis section, however, was the most undercooked. Cowen and Gross claim that\ntheirs is \u201calso a book about how to fight for social justice.\u201d They seem to\nbelieve that the reason inequality has increased is that the tools for\npinpointing talent have been inadequate. It\u2019s not obvious, though, that as\nsuch talent-spotting tools improve, inequality will decline. The authors note\nearly on that much of the growth of U.S. economic output since 1960 owes to\nthe better allocation of talent as more rights have been extended to formerly\nmistreated groups. Yet, during that same period, inequality has soared, even\nas poverty has declined (poverty and inequality tend to be inversely\ncorrelated). Given this fact, improving talent search might further worsen\ninequality, a key preoccupation of those concerned with social justice.\n\nStill, Talent should be read by anyone interested in obtaining unique insights\nand methods for finding capable people. Near the end, the authors sound a call\nto action to those in a position to offer encouragement. \u201cRaising the\naspirations of other people,\u201d they write, \u201cis one of the most beneficial\nthings you can do with your time. . . . Don\u2019t underestimate how little people\nthink of themselves. There is an ongoing crisis of confidence in many human\nbeings.\u201d For every untalented and overconfident person we encounter, someone\nis out there brimming with potential but reluctant to display it.\nEncouragement from a prominent person can go a long way.\n\nIn an era of information overload, Cowen and Gross have provided a useful book\nto remind us that if talent is rare, as it surely is, the ability to spot it\nmay be equally exceptional.\n\nRobert Henderson is a doctoral candidate at the University of Cambridge.
