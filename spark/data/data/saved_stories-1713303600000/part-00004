This makes sense. Startups are hard enough on a good day. Running your\nstartup during a time of crisis, pandemic, or downturn can feel like a battle.\n\nBut in Israel, it\u2019s literal. Throughout the last 6 months of war, Israel\u2019s\nfounders of startups at every stage have not just led; they\u2019ve done so under\ncircumstances most can scarcely imagine.\n\nThese are the real Wartime CEOs \u2013 and the leadership lessons we are about to\nshare have been forged in fire.\n\nWe\u2019ve said before that a CEO\u2019s psychology is the greatest point of leverage in\nany company\u2019s success or failure.\n\nThat\u2019s why it is my aim that every founder, everywhere, can use the 9\nleadership principles of The Wartime CEO to become even stronger leaders. In\ngood times and in bad. Without going through actual war to learn it. Use these\napproaches every day, and make sure to keep using them in the hardest days\nwhen you face a real crisis \u2013 be it in your company, your industry, or the\nentire economy.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nTo build the leadership principles in this essay, we interviewed nearly a\ndozen CEOs of Israel\u2019s top multi billion-dollar companies. Their insights\nreveal not just strategies for business resilience, but also lessons in team\nunity, personal fortitude, and the relentless pursuit of belonging.\n\nThank you to the following CEOs: Avishai Abrahami at Wix, Oz Alon at\nHoneybook, Chen Amit at Tipalti, Tomer Bar-Zeev at Unity, Yoni Assia at eToro,\nOriel Bachar at Papaya Gaming, Liron Damri at Forter, Shimon Elkabetz at\nTomorrow.io, Zeev Farbman at Lightricks, Eynat Guez at Papaya Global and\nShlomo Kramer at Cato Networks.\n\n## Restart Startup Nation: FAST\n\nWe at NFX have announced a new program called Restart Startup Nation: FAST. It\nis an ultra-fast emergency investment track to support early-stage Israeli\nstartups, primarily in artificial intelligence and biotech.\n\nThe last year has taken a toll on Israel\u2019s startup economy \u2013 judicial reform\npolitics, a global slowdown, then war \u2013 all of which caused a slowdown in new\ncompanies and funding. But Startup Nation is a country of resilient\nentrepreneurs like the leaders profiled in this essay, and they are still\nbuilding during tough times. That\u2019s we\u2019re offering the FAST opportunity to\nkickstart their efforts. Israel\u2019s next generation of founders: apply here.\n\n## Principle #1: First, Take Care of Your Employees\n\nOne of the biggest differences you can observe about top leaders is that they\ncare deeply \u2013 about the company, about their product, about their customers,\nand most of all about the people on their team.\n\n\u201cEvery company claims it cares for its people, but war really puts it to the\ntest,\u201d says Zeev Farbman, Lightricks CEO. \u201cPerks and team fun days during the\ngood times are one thing; caring for those fighting and for their families is\nsomething completely different.\u201d\n\nFor Wartime CEOs in Israel, their employees have been literally battling\nmatters of life and death. Also at every company there were a number of\nemployees called up for reserve duty, meaning they could not work for long\nstretches at a time. For Oriel Bachar, CEO at NFX-backed Papaya Gaming (nb:\ndifferent from Papaya Global) this meant imbalances and bottlenecks in organic\nand squad teams, along with high stress, low energy levels, and people on\nedge. For Farbman at Lightricks, dozens of employees were called to reserves,\nwhich meant he had to redistribute the workload among fewer people, sometimes\nwith only one-third of the team undrafted and available.\n\nThe new norm became more work, fewer people, and unimaginable stress across\nthe board. And yet every single one of our Wartime CEOs prioritized their\npeople.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the war, Liron Damri at Forter realized they needed\nto fundamentally redefine their Maslow\u2019s Pyramid: \u201cThe sense of personal\nsecurity both physically and mentally are the very first things we must take\ncare of. It meant that we provided maximum flexibility for our employees so\nthey could put their and their loved one\u2019s personal safety first. We have\nallowed people to work from home, supported reservists and their loved ones,\nand allowed the teams to volunteer in war rooms and support centers.\u201d\n\nShimon Elkabetz, CEO of Tomorrow.io agrees: \u201cPut your people in the center. If\nyour team is strong and resilient, your business has higher chances of going\nthrough this. Also, people will remember that in crisis time, the company was\na source of stability and sanity for them.\n\n## Principle #2: Prioritize Ruthlessly\n\nSecond only to caring for your people is determining what your absolute\nbusiness priorities are and how you\u2019re going to get them done.\n\nPer Farbman from Lightricks: \u201cRemember that focus and prioritization are key\nto the long term success of the business. Every startup is constantly reminded\nhow crucial focus can be, but running a company during an all-out war takes\nthis to a whole new level.\u201d If you weren\u2019t already a strong manager of\npriorities for your company, crisis times are going to eat you alive. Focus is\nthe name of the game.\n\nWhen times are especially tough, Farbman continues, \u201cas CEO your job is to\nmake sure everyone knows what needs to be done and what their role is in\nmaking it happen. You have to go back to basics, prioritizing what is key and\nputting everything else on the back burner. Unlike other times when you can\nmake small adjustments, here you have to act much more swiftly. If your\nprioritization isn\u2019t being felt, you\u2019re not cutting deep enough.\u201d\n\nRemove the nice-to-haves, the features that don\u2019t move the needle. Rethink\nwhich needle needs to move in the first place and exactly how your team is\ngoing to get it done no matter what. You don\u2019t need a war to do that.\n\n## Principle #3: Work-as-a-Service\n\nWhen the world is uncertain, Wartime CEOs provide a center of gravity for\ntheir teams.\n\nFor many, continuing to work provides a sense of purpose. Maintaining business\noperations can actually be a service to employees, giving them a chance to\nfeel normal and stay connected to routine, to each other, and to a common\npurpose.\n\n\u201cI wanted people to be able to focus on their work because it represented\nnormalcy. So we continued to work as much as possible,\u201d says Wix CEO Avishai\nAbrahami of the initial weeks of the war in Israel. \u201cWhat we learned is that\nif the leaders are back to work, people feel it is okay and accepted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to balance flexibility and sensitivity, with a gradual return\nto business and routines. We realized that if we can push at just the right\nintensity to bring attention back to work, it actually helped employees to\nbetter cope with the situation.\u201d \u2013 Oriel Bachar, CEO of Papaya Games\n\n## Principle #4: Leading By Example Is Everything\n\nIf there is only one idea you take away from this essay, make it this one.\n\nThe best leaders lead by example. It all starts with you. You\u2019re the CEO,\nyou\u2019re the inspiration. You\u2019re the one people look to. You have to become the\ntype of person that you\u2019d want leading yourself \u2014 the type of person who you\nwould willingly follow.\n\nThis includes showing up and being part of the solution. You need to be there\nand you need to be seen. Get on Zoom and show your face. Be in the office.\nText message employees proactively and personally. Find out what they are\ngoing through. Sometimes, this requires literally standing with employees in\ntheir times of need.\n\nThis principle is best exemplified by this unedited note to me from Oz Alon,\nCEO of NFX-backed Honeybook:\n\n\u201cOK, trying to dictate while I\u2019m walking. The impact of the war on our company\nwas that many employees were drafted. Probably around 20% of our employees.\nBut the first thing we all noticed was that none of the executives in the\ncompany were drafted. That didn\u2019t look good from our perspective, so we\ndecided that at least one of our executives had to be drafted. Long story\nshort, I found myself going to reserve duty after 12 years of not doing so.\n\nWhy? You expect employees to work double hard and to cover for their\ncolleagues, and to do so even while they are depressed. They have to see you\ndo all that \u2013 and then some. The fact that I was drafted actually really\nhelped. The number one lesson for me is that leading by example is everything\nin wartime.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s what I have while walking home on the beautiful and alive\nstreets of Tel Aviv.\u201d\n\nWix\u2019s Abrahami sums it up: \u201cAs a CEO you are leader. So lead. And if you are\nthe kind of leader that does not abandon his team when things are hard, then\nmake sure your team knows and feels it.\u201d\n\n## Principle #5: Communication Is The Bedrock Of Trust\n\nThe wartime CEO maintains clear, transparent, and regular communication with\ntheir teams. This includes not just updates about the business but also\nensuring that employees feel connected, supported, and part of a larger\ncommunity. This builds a strong sense of trust and unity among their team\nmembers.\n\nSome CEOs communicate at the beginning of a crisis and then drop the ball.\nBuild a communication routine that employees can anticipate and rely on, and\nkeep it going even when you think you\u2019re past the worst part of your crisis.\nChances are there are ripple effects to come for much longer than you think.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to communicate with your teams even when you don\u2019t have\nanything new to say,\u201d advises Tomer Bar-Zeev, CEO of Unity. \u201cDon\u2019t\nunderestimate the importance of having employees hear from you (and ideally\nsee you) during turbulent times. A big part of what people look for is a sense\nof belonging and stability in a chaotic reality.\u201d\n\n## Principle #6: What\u2019s Your Business Continuity Plan?\n\nNo matter the type of crisis, when it hits, you need a plan. Assume things are\ngoing to be worse than you think and change your course to reflect the new\nreality. Look ahead and map out all the vectors of attack or disruption that\nyour company could face. As Eynat Guez, CEO of Papaya Global put it: \u201cYou need\nto ensure you have mitigation for all potential scenarios.\u201d It\u2019s your job to\nreduce the disruption to your business and customers.\n\nIn the case of war in Israel, Chen Amit, CEO of Tipalti, temporarily moved a\ndozen key R&D employees to their London office. They needed to ensure business\ncontinuity from an engineering perspective in case there was further\ndeterioration in Israel. Other companies like Unity had teams outside of\nIsrael that were able to help shoulder some of the burden. \u201cWe were very clear\nin asking for their support and thanking them for stepping in.\u201d\n\nEvery one of our Israeli CEOs moved swiftly to implement their plan in the\nfirst days of the war. They displayed creative organizational thinking as well\nas a sense of team spirit.\n\nDon\u2019t just tell your teams what to do. Ask them to rally for each other and\nfor a purpose. The same goes for any company facing a disruptive and\nchallenging situation.\n\n## Principle #7: Find The Goldilocks Zone\n\nMy colleague James Currier coined the term The Goldilocks Zone to describe a\npowerful mental model for top leaders. \u201cThe Goldilocks Zone is about finding\nsomething that\u2019s neither too hot, nor too cold, but just right for your\nstartup. It\u2019s not about balance or finding the \u201cmiddle.\u201d In fact, what\u2019s just\nright for you can sometimes be quite extreme. Instead, it\u2019s about finding a\ncustomized and nuanced answer to each problem you are wrestling with, that\nfully takes your specific context into account.\u201d\n\nIn all the major areas of being a Founder \u2014 cultivating yourself, managing\nemployees, communicating with investors, navigating the market \u2014 learning to\nrecognize the Goldilocks Zone is a non-obvious skill that distinguishes world-\nclass entrepreneurs from the rest.\n\nAt any given time, a CEO is pulled in different directions. You need to\naddress short-term needs as well as long-term goals; weigh worst-case\nscenarios against best-case outcomes; and strike a balance between realism and\noptimism \u2013 be it the routine day-to-day or during a crisis.\n\nShort Term v Long Term. \u201cFacing unprecedented challenges head-on, a wartime\nCEO makes tough decisions swiftly to protect the company and its people,\u201d says\nYoni Assia, CEO of eToro. \u201cThey balance short-term crisis management with\nlong-term strategic vision, ensuring the company remains resilient and\nadaptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake the time you need\u201d v \u201cBack to business.\u201d There\u2019s a spectrum and getting\nit right is very hard to do. \u201cWe initially asked people not to work at all and\nonly focus on their families, and over the weeks very slowly increased our\n\u2018ask\u2019 of employees, making very clear that their safety, both physical and\nmental, were still the first consideration. \u2013 Unity\n\nWorst-Case v Best-Case. \u201cThe Wartime CEO needs to be able to believe in the\nfuture, to run the worst case scenarios alongside the best-cases scenarios and\nto be ready for both. \u2013 Eynat / Papaya\n\nRealism v Optimism. The Wartime CEO must do both. Navigating a company through\ncrisis requires a delicate balance between being realistic about the\nchallenges faced and maintaining an optimistic outlook on the future. This\nbalance helps in making informed decisions while also inspiring hope and\nresilience among team members.\n\n## Principle #8: Practice Optimism\n\nA few years ago I wrote that part of what makes a strong startup CEO is\noptimism. Be optimistic. Be optimistic about your team, about yourself, about\nyour chances to win. Without this it\u2019s hard to get yourself and others to stay\nmotivated.\n\nYou have to know that you can build the future and add value in some big way.\nThis vision can\u2019t go away during times of crisis. In fact, this is when\noptimism might be the single best mindset you can bring to your team.\n\nI\u2019ve always liked this quote from Frank Herbet\u2019s Dune:\n\n\u201cThe mind can go either direction under stress\u2014toward positive or toward\nnegative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are\nunconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive\nend. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by\ntraining.\u201d\n\nPractice optimism in good times so that you can still access it when\neverything goes wrong.\n\n## Principle #9: The Company is a Community\n\n\u201cIn times of crisis, your employees aren\u2019t just the individuals that work for\nyou. You have a level of responsibility for their families and the society in\nwhich you work and operate.\u201d \u2013 Unity\n\nIt\u2019s worth asking yourself: What if this were true all the time?\n\nEmployees who feel connected to a larger purpose and to each other are more\nmotivated and engaged. Building a strong company culture that emphasizes\nshared goals and values is crucial in any business environment.\n\n## Leading In Hard Times\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be in a war in order to live by the leadership principles of\nThe Wartime CEO. These are not just crisis management strategies. These are\nexemplary leadership behaviors that can proactively enhance the resilience,\nagility, and teamwork of any organization, regardless of the external\nenvironment.\n\nAdopting these approaches can equip startup founders and CEOs everywhere to\nnavigate their own unique challenges more effectively, building companies that\nare capable of handling whatever is thrown at them \u2013 and come out even\nstronger.\n\nSubscribe for more Leadership insights\n\nGet our weekly newsletter that 258K+ startup teams read\n\nGigi Levy-Weiss\n\nGeneral Partner\n\nAs Founders ourselves, we respect your time.
