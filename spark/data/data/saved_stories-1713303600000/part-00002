Their research, detailed in the journal Advanced Intelligent\nSystems, introduces a flexible structure that maximises the efficiency and\nrange of movement achievable with muscle tissues.\n\n### Muscle powered robots\n\nMuscles possess power and precision unmatched by synthetic devices. Using this\npotential for robotic applications has caused challenges due to the\nunpredictable nature of muscle contractions when not anchored properly. Raman\nand her colleagues set out to create a design that could reliably convert\nmuscle contractions into precise and powerful movements.\n\nThe flexure can focus a muscle\u2019s contraction along a specific direction,\noptimising the transfer of force into motion. This is achieved by ensuring the\ndevice is soft and flexible in one direction while stiff in others,\neffectively magnifying the muscle\u2019s output.\n\nWhen muscle tissue is attached to the flexure, it pulls on the spring-like\nstructure with consistency and efficiency, stretching it up to five times more\nthan previous designs.\n\n### Predictable and reliable\n\nUnlike conventional muscle actuator setups, where muscles often produce\nerratic movements, the MIT flexure offers a predictable and reliable\nmechanism. By using precision-engineered flexures, robotics can now create\nmuscle-powered robots with multiple degrees of freedom, enabling them to\nperform complex tasks with agility and control.\n\n\u201cThese flexures are like a skeleton that people can now use to turn muscle\nactuation into multiple degrees of freedom of motion in a very predictable\nway,\u201d explains Ritu Raman.\n\n### Could robots perform surgical procedures?\n\nWith this flexible skeleton module as a foundation, engineers can construct a\nwide range of artificial skeletons tailored for various robotic\nconfigurations. By combining these flexures, they can design robots capable of\nperforming tasks ranging from surgical procedures to delicate manipulations in\nenvironments where traditional robots struggle to operate.\n\nOne promising application highlighted by Raman is the development of small-\nscale surgical robots with enhanced strength, efficiency, and adaptability.\nThese biohybrid robots, powered by natural muscles, could change minimally\ninvasive procedures, offering greater precision and control inside the human\nbody.\n\nAs the team continues to refine and expand upon their flexure design, the\nfuture of muscle-powered robotics appears increasingly promising. By using the\noutstanding capabilities of muscle tissues, these robots may unlock new\nboundaries in automation and healthcare.\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Print\n\n#### Editor's Recommended Articles\n\n  * Must Read >> Drone Superhighways: Will robotics and automation change our lives?\n\n  * Must Read >> Robots now feature bones, ligaments, and tendons in a single process\n\n  * Must Read >> Cutting-edge robot holds promise for early breast cancer diagnosis\n\n  * TAGS\n  * Digital Technology\n  * Robotics\n\nHarriet Belderbos\n\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n### Holodeck: Changing robotics training with infinite virtual environments\n\n### Perovskite LED display promises next-gen smart devices\n\n### Leicester City Council cyberattack exposes sensitive data\n\n### Artificial intelligence outperforms doctors in clinical reasoning\n\n### Mobile printers: Creating value form your government or utilities\noperations\n\n### All-IP traffic: Why businesses should act now or face \u2018The switch off gold\nrush\u2019\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply\n\n#### Related Academic Articles\n\n### Do research software engineers have research methods?\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\n### Tuneable phononic crystals and topological acoustics\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\n### Toward human systems integration maturity\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\n#### Follow Open Access Government\n\n#### Technology Reports\n\n### Northwestern VLSI Lab delivers AI empowered neural processing for\nintelligent human...\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\n### Realise more value from your government or utilities operations\n\nJanuary 26, 2024\n\n### Webinar \u2013 Trends driving EV growth & how to win the...\n\nMarch 6, 2023\n\n### A Bluetooth tracking device to aid in the search for older...\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\n#### Technology eBooks\n\n### Alternative broadband delivery solutions\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\n### Innovation Centre for Applied Sustainable Technologies: Accelerating the\nUK\u2019s net-zero carbon...\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nJuly 20, 2023\n\n### Transformations to knowledge-based technology at Vestas Aircoil\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nFebruary 3, 2023\n\n### Sensing and computing challenges for enhanced data integrity\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nOctober 20, 2022\n\n#### Useful Resources\n\n  * Publications\n  * Stakeholders\n  * eBooks\n  * Special Reports\n\n#### Quick Links\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * About Us\n  * Our Editors\n  * Our Audience\n  * Prestige Contributors\n  * Testimonials\n\n#### Feature Articles\n\n### What are the challenges of vaccine refrigeration?\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\n### The natural refrigerant choice and environmental considerations\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n### Vigilant\u2019s Secure Data Sharing Platform has been described as, \u201carguably\nthe...\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n### Damp and mould-related surveys: What is a healthy building?\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n#### Latest Publication\n\n### Open Access Government April 2024\n\nQuick Launch Publication More Details\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n#### Latest eBook\n\n### Are over-the-counter drugs an under-appreciated toxic danger?\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nABOUT US\n\nOpen Access Government produces compelling and informative products for a wide\naudience.
