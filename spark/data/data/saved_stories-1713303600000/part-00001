have revealed Holodeck, a system inspired by Star Trek\u2019s\nHolodeck, designed to generate limitless interactive 3D environments for\ntraining robots\n\nDeveloped by a team of experts from the University of Pennsylvania and\ncollaborators from leading institutions, including Stanford University and the\nAllen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Holodeck promises to accelerate\nthe development of robots capable of navigating and interacting safely in\ncomplex real-world scenarios.\n\n### Startrek coming to life\n\nHolodeck operates on the idea of using language-based commands to replicate\ndetailed virtual spaces.\n\nThe idea comes from Captain Picard\u2019s requests onboard the Starship Enterprise,\nusers can describe the environment they envision, and Holodeck brings it to\nlife with authenticity.\n\nThis system is set to address a challenge in AI research: the lack of diverse\nvirtual environments needed to train AI effectively.\n\n\u201cWe only have a fraction of that amount of 3D environments for training so-\ncalled \u2019embodied AI.\u2019 If we want to use generative AI techniques to develop\nrobots that can safely navigate in real-world environments, then we will need\nto create millions or billions of simulated environments\u201d says Callison-Burch.\n\n### The process behind Holodeck\n\nHolodeck uses large language models (LLMs), similar to those powering advanced\nchatbots like ChatGPT, to interpret user commands and generate environments\naccordingly. Users can specify details, from the layout and furnishings to\nspecific objects like a researcher\u2019s apartment.\n\nTo strengthen Holodeck\u2019s effectiveness, researchers conducted comprehensive\ntests comparing its outputs with existing tools like ProcTHOR, a predecessor\ndeveloped by AI2. Students consistently preferred scenes generated by Holodeck\nfor their realism, coherence, and overall appeal across various settings,\nincluding stores, public spaces, and offices.\n\n### Holodeck\u2019s impact on robot training\n\nBy fine-tuning AI agents using environments generated by Holodeck, researchers\nobserved improvements in the agents\u2019 ability to navigate spaces.\n\nAgents trained with Holodeck-generated scenes showed a higher success rate in\nlocating specific objects like a piano in a music room compared to traditional\nmethods.\n\n\u201cThis field has been stuck doing research in residential spaces for a long\ntime,\u201d says Yang. \u201cBut there are so many diverse environments out there,\nefficiently generating a lot of environments to train robots has always been a\nbig challenge, but Holodeck provides this functionality.\u201d\n\nWith Holodeck\u2019s ability to generate immersive and varied environments rapidly,\nHolodeck holds promise for applications in gaming, virtual reality,\narchitecture, and urban planning.\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * Twitter\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Print\n\n#### Editor's Recommended Articles\n\n  * Must Read >> Drone Superhighways: Will robotics and automation change our lives?\n\n  * Must Read >> Computerized DNA motors are moving molecular robotics to the next level\n\n  * Must Read >> AI and adaptive dementia-supporting technology\n\n  * TAGS\n  * Artificial Intelligence\n  * Robotics\n\nHarriet Belderbos\n\n#### RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\n\n### Perovskite LED display promises next-gen smart devices\n\n### MIT engineers design breakthrough flexure for muscle-powered robots\n\n### Leicester City Council cyberattack exposes sensitive data\n\n### Artificial intelligence outperforms doctors in clinical reasoning\n\n### Mobile printers: Creating value form your government or utilities\noperations\n\n### All-IP traffic: Why businesses should act now or face \u2018The switch off gold\nrush\u2019\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply\n\n#### Related Academic Articles\n\n### Do research software engineers have research methods?\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\n### Tuneable phononic crystals and topological acoustics\n\nMarch 25, 2024\n\n### Toward human systems integration maturity\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\n#### Follow Open Access Government\n\n#### Technology Reports\n\n### Northwestern VLSI Lab delivers AI empowered neural processing for\nintelligent human...\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\n### Realise more value from your government or utilities operations\n\nJanuary 26, 2024\n\n### Webinar \u2013 Trends driving EV growth & how to win the...\n\nMarch 6, 2023\n\n### A Bluetooth tracking device to aid in the search for older...\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\n#### Technology eBooks\n\n### Alternative broadband delivery solutions\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\n### Innovation Centre for Applied Sustainable Technologies: Accelerating the\nUK\u2019s net-zero carbon...\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nJuly 20, 2023\n\n### Transformations to knowledge-based technology at Vestas Aircoil\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nFebruary 3, 2023\n\n### Sensing and computing challenges for enhanced data integrity\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nOctober 20, 2022\n\n#### Useful Resources\n\n  * Publications\n  * Stakeholders\n  * eBooks\n  * Special Reports\n\n#### Quick Links\n\n  * Contact Us\n  * About Us\n  * Our Editors\n  * Our Audience\n  * Prestige Contributors\n  * Testimonials\n\n#### Feature Articles\n\n### What are the challenges of vaccine refrigeration?\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\n### The natural refrigerant choice and environmental considerations\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n### Vigilant\u2019s Secure Data Sharing Platform has been described as, \u201carguably\nthe...\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n### Damp and mould-related surveys: What is a healthy building?\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n#### Latest Publication\n\n### Open Access Government April 2024\n\nQuick Launch Publication More Details\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\n#### Latest eBook\n\n### Are over-the-counter drugs an under-appreciated toxic danger?\n\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nABOUT US\n\nOpen Access Government produces compelling and informative products for a wide\naudience.
