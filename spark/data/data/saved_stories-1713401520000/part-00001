Luckily, the\nLastPass worker didn't fall for it because the whole thing set off so many red\nflags.\n\n\"As the attempted communication was outside of normal business communication\nchannels and due to the employee\u2019s suspicion regarding the presence of many of\nthe hallmarks of a social engineering attempt (such as forced urgency),\" the\npost reads, \"our employee rightly ignored the messages and reported the\nincident to our internal security team so that we could take steps to both\nmitigate the threat and raise awareness of the tactic both internally and\nexternally.\"\n\n## Big Phish\n\nAs the company noted in its blog post, these sorts of attacks are on the rise.\nIn fact, a Hong Kong tech worker ended up paying out $25 million to a scammer\nearlier this year who'd used deepfake technology to make a video impersonating\nnot only his company's CEO, but several other people who worked with him, too.\n\nWhile this LastPass scam attempt failed, those who follow these sorts of\nthings may recall that the company has been subject to successful hacks\nbefore.\n\nIn August 2022, as a timeline of the event compiled by the Cybersecurity Dive\nblog detailed, a hacker compromised a LastPass engineer's laptop and used it\nto steal source code and company secrets, eventually getting access to its\ncustomer database \u2014 including encrypted passwords and unencrypted user data\nlike email addresses.\n\nAccording to that timeline, the clearly-resourceful bad actor remained active\nin the company's servers for months, and it took more than two months for\nLastPass to admit that it had been breached. More than six months after the\ninitial breach, Toubba, the CEO, provided a blow-by-blow timeline of the\nmonths-long attack and said he took \"full responsibility\" for the way things\nwent down in a February 2023 blog post.\n\nIt's no surprise that in the aftermath of that lengthy breach, which somehow\ndidn't entirely tank the company, its employees are on edge about potential\nhacks \u2014 and lucky for them, good old-fashioned skepticism let them nip this\none in the bud.\n\nMore on voice cloning: Bone-Chilling AI Scam Fakes Your Loved Ones' Voices to\nDemand Hostage Ransom\n\nShare This Article\n\nOverly Broad\n\nExperts Slam Tennessee's New Law Banning AI Impersonations\n\nMar 22, 3:58 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\nBeyond the Grave\n\nGeorge Carlin's Daughter Horrified by AI-Generated \"Comedy Special\" of Her\nDead Dad\n\nJan 11, 12:30 PM EST\n\nRead More\n\nVoices Carry\n\nSAG-AFTRA Inks Controversial Deal to Allow AI-Generated Voice Acting\n\nJan 10, 4:37 PM EST\n\nRead More\n\nBring On the Nerds\n\nThe Most Fearsome Hackers Just Went Ham on ChatGPT\n\n8.14.23, 4:00 PM EDT\n\nRead More\n\n+Social+Newsletter\n\nTopicsAbout UsEditorial StandardsContact Us\n\nDISCLAIMER(S)\n\nPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsDMCA Policy\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue\nof any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of\nService.\n\n\u00a9 Recurrent Ventures Inc, All Rights Reserved.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
