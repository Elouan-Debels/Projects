It\ndoes not identify any co-conspirators, either.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Urban made the following transfers to an \"Exodus\nwallet\" on his computer:\n\n  * About $294,797 worth of \"Ethereum\" from one victim. Ethereum is the blockchain for ether, a cryptocurrency.\n  * $21,952 worth of bitcoin from a second victim.\n  * About $37,742 worth of bitcoin from the third victim.\n  * About $107,230 worth of Ethereum from the fourth victim.\n  * About $374,614 worth of Ethereum from the fifth victim.\n\n## More details about the cryptocurrency scheme\n\nUrban and other conspirators unlawfully obtained victims' personal identifying\ninformation and used it to fraudulently access their virtual currency\naddresses.\n\nUsing a SIM swap, the conspirators reset the victims' passwords and verified\nownership of the victims\u2019 cellphone numbers by one-time passwords. A SIM swap\nis a type of fraud in which conspirators take over a person\u2019s cellphone\naccount so that the victim\u2019s incoming messages and texts are sent to a\ndifferent phone. Once the SIM is swapped, the person can access the victim\u2019s\naccounts, including those that use two-factor authentication.\n\nOnce they accessed the victims' phones, Urban and other conspirators\nunlawfully transferred the victims\u2019 cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency wallets\ncontrolled by the defendants, according to the indictment.\n\nParts of the indictment read like a primer on cryptocurrency. Here are some\nterms and meanings used in the documents:\n\n  * Virtual currencies are digital tokens of value circulated over the internet in place of traditional \u201cfiat\u201d currency.\n  * Virtual currency addresses were virtual locations where virtual currencies were sent or received. They were represented by strings of letters and numbers.\n  * Virtual currency transactions are many times required to be publicly recorded on a \u201cblockchain\u201d which is basically a public ledger run by a computer network \u201ccontaining an immutable and historical record of every transaction ...\u201d Different types of virtual currencies have different blockchains.\n  * Subscriber Identity Module or SIM is technology used to identify subscribers on mobile phones.\n  * Two factor Identification code \u201c2FA\u201d is used to increase security and make sure that the person is the authorized user.\n  * One-time password or OTP is a type of two factor identification code.\n\nUrban faces up to 20 years in federal prison on each wire fraud charge and a\nminimum mandatory penalty of two years in prison for the aggravated identity\ntheft.\n\nUrban was being held in custody pending a detention hearing scheduled for\nTuesday in Jacksonville.\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\n  * Help\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Subscription Terms & Conditions\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Site Map\n  * Accessibility\n  * Our Ethical Principles\n  * Responsible Disclosure\n  * Your Privacy Choices\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Gannett 2024\n\n## About Your Privacy\n\nClicking on the \"Reject All\" Button retains the default setting of only\nstrictly necessary cookies.\n\nWe and our 64 partners store and/or access information on a device, such as\nunique IDs in cookies to process personal data.
