It's\ncreeping closer to mainstream deployment and bringing an existential crisis\nfor SEOs and website makers everywhere.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an\nInsider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nComing from the other direction is an influx of posts from Reddit, Quora, and\nother internet forums that have climbed up through the traditional set of\nGoogle links.\n\nData analysis from Semrush, which predicts traffic based on search ranking,\nshows that traffic to Reddit has climbed at an impressive clip since August.\nSemrush estimated that Reddit had over 132 million visitors in August 2023. At\nthe time of publishing, it was projected to have over 346 million visitors in\nApril 2024.\n\nOrganic search traffic to Reddit over the past two years Semrush\n\nNone of this is accidental. For years, Google has been watching users tack on\n\"Reddit\" to the end of search queries and finally decided to do something\nabout it.\n\nGoogle started dropping hints in 2022 when it promised to do a better job of\npromoting sites that weren't just chasing the top of search but were more\nhelpful and human.\n\nLast August, Google rolled out a big update to Search that seemed to kick this\ninto action. Reddit, Quora, and other forum sites started getting more\nvisibility in Google, both within the traditional links and within a new\n\"discussions and forums\" section, which you may have spotted if you're US-\nbased.\n\nThe timing of this Reddit bump has led to some conspiracy theories. In\nFebruary, Google and Reddit announced a blockbuster deal that would let Google\ntrain its AI models on Reddit content. Google said the deal, reportedly worth\n$60 million, would \"facilitate more content-forward displays of Reddit\ninformation,\" leading to some speculation that Google promised Reddit better\nvisibility in exchange for the valuable training data. A few weeks later,\nReddit also went public.\n\nA Google spokesperson told BI: \"Our agreement with Reddit absolutely did not\ninclude ranking its content higher on Search.\"\n\nIndeed, SEO experts have watched this Reddit bump since August when Google\nrolled out a crucial search update six months before the deal was announced.\n\nIt's not just Reddit. Q&A forum Quora is getting a huge visibility bump in\nGoogle search results, per Semrush and Sistrix data. Google says \"hundreds\" of\nother forums and communities across the web are also getting the bump.\n\nStill, given Reddit's size, its rise is the most noticeable. Per Sistrix data,\nReddit is now as visible in top Google Search results as Instagram.\n\nReddit's visibility in Google Search now matches that of Instagram Sistrix\n\nSteve Paine, marketing manager at Sistrix, called the rise of Reddit\n\"unprecedented.\"\n\n\"There hasn't been a website that's grown so much search visibility so quickly\nin the US in at least the last five years,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nRight now, Reddit ranks high for product searches. Reddit's main competitors\nare Wikipedia, YouTube, and Fandom, Paine said, and it also competes in \"high-\nvalue commercial searches,\" putting it up against Amazon. The \"real\ncompetitors,\" he said, are the subreddits that compete with brands on the web.\n\n## Giving the people what they want\n\nWhy is Google doing this, and why now?\n\nThe company's stance here is simple: it's giving users what they want.\n\n\"Our research has shown that people often want to learn from others'\nexperiences with a topic, so we've continued to make it easier to find helpful\nperspectives on Search when it's relevant to a query,\" a Google spokesperson\ntold BI. \"Our systems surface content from hundreds of forums and other\ncommunities across the web, and we conduct rigorous testing to ensure results\nare helpful and high quality.\"\n\nResponding to a post on X, Google search liaison Danny Sullivan said users not\nonly like seeing \"forum content\" but that they \"proactively seek it out.\"\n\nThis shift in search behavior has already been happening for several years. In\nJuly 2022, Google's search head Prabhakar Raghavan said younger users were\nturning to alternative sources such as TikTok and Instagram for information\nand recommendations. Last year, during the Reddit blackout in June, Google\nSearch got considerably worse.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai on stage at Google IO 2023 JOSH EDELSON/GETTY\n\nGoogle's Reddit deal and its endorsement of Reddit content in Search show how\nmuch it sees Reddit as a crucial part of the future of search.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"It's obvious that Google has this vision that they need more user-generated\ncontent,\" said Aleyda Solis, an SEO consultant for Orainti, who added that\nthis is one way Google can respond to the rise in TikTok, Instagram, and other\nsocial spaces.\n\nWhile Google might not be pumping Reddit results in exchange for training\ndata, Google's AI systems would benefit from the more up-to-date information\nReddit can give, especially when SGE rolls out in full.\n\nFurthermore, a paper written by several Google employees, published in late\n2023, claims that pulling information from an internet search can better\nimprove the accuracy of chatbots.\n\nNamed FreshPrompt, the method would incorporate \"relevant and up-to-date\ninformation retrieved from a search engine\" to improve a chatbot such as\nGoogle's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\n## Grifters can hijack search\n\nThe question is whether this Reddit bump will continue or Google will nerf it.\nThere are risks associated with Reddit, which relies on unpaid moderators to\npolice unsavory content and spam.\n\nGoogle told BI its systems work on all websites, including Quora and Reddit.\nStill, there's evidence that people are already abusing the rise of these\nsites in Google rankings. In a February study, SEO blogger Glen Allsopp found\nthat 51% of Reddit's top-ranking threads in Google Search's forums sections\ncontained spam as a top comment.\n\nYouTube already has heaps of videos offering advice on hijacking Reddit to\nrise to the top of Google Search. One of the most popular videos right now\nteaches viewers to purchase abandoned Reddit accounts, seek out popular Reddit\nposts to post comments filled with affiliate links, and then artificially\ninflate their popularity using \"upvotes\" purchased from third-party websites.\nThis way, they can feasibly rocket to the top of Google.\n\nIt might not be that difficult. Search Engine Journal reported this week that\none Reddit user climbed to top-ranking Google Search results in minutes (BI\ncould confirm the post ranked in the top 10, but couldn't independently verify\nthe time it took to get there).\n\nA Google spokesperson said the company's anti-spam policies apply to all\ncontent and that it takes particular attention to searches for sensitive\ntopics such as health or finance.\n\nStill, it's unclear how much Google's spam-attacking systems, which just got a\nboost, work right now. Reddit is \"heavily manipulated at the end of the day,\"\nand people can easily take advantage of it by posting content there, Solis\nsaid.\n\nLily Ray, vice president of SEO strategy and research for marketing agency\nAmsive, told BI she is concerned that Google is \"shifting the burden\" of\nmonitoring abuse onto Reddit moderators. Neglected subreddits risk getting\nspammed with unhelpful or even false content.\n\nRay wrote on LinkedIn last week that she found an example of Reddit ranking\nprominently at the top of Google when she searched \"How to lose 10 pounds in a\nweek\".\n\n\"A redditor suggested 'cutting your arm off,'\" she wrote.\n\nThis raises questions about whether Google can keep bad content from being\neaten by its AI-generated search engine, which often sources its responses\nfrom the top search results. Already, Google is fighting an influx of AI-\ngenerated content flooding the web. At the same time, rivals such as OpenAI\nand Perplexity try to steal Google's lunch with AI chatbots that work like\nsearch engineers.\n\nA Google spokesperson told BI that the company's analysis did not find that\nmore harmful content on Search comes from forums.\n\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman Greg Doherty/Getty Images\n\n## There's room to grow - and that's good news for Reddit investors\n\nThe assessment in the SEO community right now is that Google has leaned too\nhard into community discussion, and it may need to recalibrate once users\nstart complaining that, actually, too much Reddit in Google results can be a\nbad thing.\n\nSistrix's Paine said 48.9% of the reddit.com ranking content appears in the\ntop 10 Google Search results, yet only 8% show in the top 3, according to a\nstudy from his firm \u2014 giving plenty of room for Reddit only to grow, which is\nsomething Reddit investors will be pleased to know.\n\nGoogle may also decide to course-correct.\n\n\"Personally, I would expect this current dominance by Reddit to calm down once\nGoogle notes that the search experience has not been improved by the increased\ninclusion of Reddit,\" SEO consultant Natalie Slater told BI.\n\n\"One of the questions is, will it retain this visibility?\" Paine said of\nReddit. \"On one hand, this is unprecedented growth, and there's a feeling that\nit must end soon.\"\n\nOn the other, he added, there's plenty of space for Reddit's presence in\nGoogle Search to grow even bigger.\n\nFor now, Reddit and Google need each other, and it may be in neither of their\ninterests to stop a good thing.\n\nOn February 28, Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, joined 31\nother media groups and filed a $2.3 billion suit against Google in Dutch\ncourt, alleging losses suffered due to the company's advertising practices.\n\nRead next\n\n### Watch:\n\nGoogle Reddit\n\nFollow us on:\n\n  * * Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.
