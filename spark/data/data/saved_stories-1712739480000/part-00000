We want to reduce\nfriction by making it easier to get data into our products. This also means\nproviding transparent pricing, so customers can be confident that costs make\neconomic sense for their business, especially as they scale.\n\nToday, we\u2019re introducing four new improvements to help you build media\napplications with Cloudflare:\n\n  * Cloudflare Calls is in open beta with transparent pricing\n  * Cloudflare Stream has a Live Clipping API to let your viewers instantly clip from ongoing streams\n  * Cloudflare Images has a pre-built upload widget that you can embed in your application to accept uploads from your users\n  * Cloudflare Images lets you crop and resize images of people at scale with automatic face cropping\n\n### Build real-time video and audio applications with Cloudflare Calls\n\nCloudflare Calls is now in open beta, and you can activate it from your\ndashboard. Your usage will be free until May 15, 2024. Starting May 15, 2024,\ncustomers with a Calls subscription will receive the first terabyte each month\nfor free, with any usage beyond that charged at $0.05 per real-time gigabyte.\nAdditionally, there are no charges for inbound traffic to Cloudflare.\n\nTo get started, read the developer documentation for Cloudflare Calls.\n\n### Live Instant Clipping: create clips from live streams and recordings\n\nLive broadcasts often include short bursts of highly engaging content within a\nlonger stream. Creators and viewers alike enjoy being able to make a \u201cclip\u201d of\nthese moments to share across multiple channels. Being able to generate that\nclip rapidly enables our customers to offer instant replays, showcase key\npieces of recordings, and build audiences on social media in real-time.\n\nToday, Cloudflare Stream is launching Live Instant Clipping in open beta for\nall customers. With the new Live Clipping API, you can let your viewers\ninstantly clip and share moments from an ongoing stream - without re-encoding\nthe video.\n\nWhen planning this feature, we considered a typical user flow for generating\nclips from live events. Consider users watching a stream of a video game:\nsomething wild happens and users want to save and share a clip of it to social\nmedia. What will they do?\n\nFirst, they\u2019ll need to be able to review the preceding few minutes of the\nbroadcast, so they know what to clip. Next, they need to select a start time\nand clip duration or end time, possibly as a visualization on a timeline or by\nscrubbing the video player. Finally, the clip must be available quickly in a\nway that can be replayed or shared across multiple platforms, even after the\noriginal broadcast has ended.\n\nThat ideal user flow implies some heavy lifting in the background. We now\noffer a manifest to preview recent live content in a rolling window, and we\nprovide the timing information in that response to determine the start and end\ntimes of the requested clip relative to the whole broadcast. Finally, on\nrequest, we will generate on-the-fly that clip as a standalone video file for\neasy sharing as well as an HLS manifest for embedding into players.\n\nLive Instant Clipping is available in beta to all customers starting today!\nLive clips are free to make; they do not count toward storage quotas, and\nplayback is billed just like minutes of video delivered. To get started, check\nout the Live Clipping API in developer documentation.\n\n### Integrate Cloudflare Images into your application with only a few lines of\ncode\n\nBuilding applications with user-uploaded images is even easier with the upload\nwidget, a pre-built, interactive UI that lets users upload images directly\ninto your Cloudflare Images account.\n\nMany developers use Cloudflare Images as an end-to-end image management\nsolution to support applications that center around user-generated content,\nfrom AI photo editors to social media platforms. Our APIs connect the frontend\nexperience \u2013 where users upload their images \u2013 to the storage, optimization,\nand delivery operations in the backend.\n\nBut building an application can take time. Our team saw a huge opportunity to\ntake away as much extra work as possible, and we wanted to provide off-the-\nshelf integration to speed up the development process.\n\nWith the upload widget, you can seamlessly integrate Cloudflare Images into\nyour application within minutes. The widget can be integrated in two ways: by\nembedding a script into a static HTML page or by installing a package that\nworks with your favorite framework. We provide a ready-made Worker template\nthat you can deploy directly to your account to connect your frontend\napplication with Cloudflare Images and authorize users to upload through the\nwidget.\n\nTo try out the upload widget, sign up for our closed beta.\n\n### Optimize images of people with automatic face cropping for Cloudflare\nImages\n\nCloudflare Images lets you dynamically manipulate images in different aspect\nratios and dimensions for various use cases. With face cropping for Cloudflare\nImages, you can now crop and resize images of people\u2019s faces at scale. For\nexample, if you\u2019re building a social media application, you can apply\nautomatic face cropping to generate profile picture thumbnails from user-\nuploaded images.\n\nOur existing gravity parameter uses saliency detection to set the focal point\nof an image based on the most visually interesting pixels, which determines\nhow the image will be cropped. We expanded this feature by using a machine\nlearning model called RetinaFace, which classifies images that have human\nfaces. We\u2019re also introducing a new zoom parameter that you can combine with\nface cropping to specify how closely an image should be cropped toward the\nface.\n\nTo apply face cropping to your image optimization, sign up for our closed\nbeta.\n\nPhoto by Eye for Ebony on Unsplash\n\n    \n    \n    https://example.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=crop,width=500,height=500,gravity=face,zoom=0.6/https://example.com/images/picture.jpg\n\n### Meet the Media team over Discord\n\nAs we\u2019re working to build the next set of media tools, we\u2019d love to hear what\nyou\u2019re building for your users.
