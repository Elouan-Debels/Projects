One of America\u2019s\nleading clearance agents, Deborah has spent 20 years dodging red tape to\nacquire music for film, samples and video games. Her role includes hunting\nobscure records, checking artists get their dough and putting the G-Funk in\nGrand Theft Auto.\n\nMannis-Gardner\u2019s clients include Cash Money, Kanye, Rick Ross, Nas, Diddy and\nalmost every other private jet gaucho. She fights for superstars as well as\nminor artists and is fervently against clearance becoming solely a\nmillionaire\u2019s game. Deborah\u2019s vocal about protecting the culture of sampling\nand despite the thirsty trend of litigation, is yet to be taken to court. The\nfeisty Jewish woman, who loves rap, discussed her favourite unreleased track,\nurban artists being unfairly sued, repercussions from the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d\nlawsuit and getting Diddy on the phone with Enya.\n\nHas there been a sample you couldn\u2019t find?\n\nOh sure, there\u2019s been situations where we can\u2019t find a sampled copyright. I\nthink my clients like to challenge me. I\u2019ve been doing this now for 25 years,\nso I think the percentage of songs I haven\u2019t found is under one percent.\n\nYour company DMG is known for clearing traditionally difficult samples. What\ndo you need to do to get sign off from Prince?\n\nPrince doesn\u2019t license his stuff for sampling. They\u2019re a group that flat out\ndeny samples.\n\nWhat about for usage in film?\n\nPrince, I have cleared for film, but that hasn\u2019t been since the movie In Her\nShoes [2005]. All the rights have reverted back to him, so I don\u2019t know where\nit stands at this moment. I went to clear something recently and because of\nour timeline, we chose to pull it rather than chase it. I went to clear a\nprominent, big selling artist for a sample, who has relations with him. They\nreached out to him and his people said \u201cwe like your song, but we\u2019re still\ngoing to deny you.\u201d\n\nHave you encountered a small artist surprising you by turning down a sample\nrequest from a superstar?\n\nWhenever I clear a sample, I try to not make it about who the artist is that\u2019s\nsampling it, because my clients range from Eminem to Michael Jackson. I\u2019ve\ndealt with very large artists, Rihanna, to small artists like when Macklemore\nwas nobody. I try to make it really clear that it\u2019s about the sample, what\nthey\u2019ve used, how they\u2019ve used it and the final outcome of the new song. It\nshould be irrelevant who sampled it, especially with what the quote is, so if\nMarshall [Eminem] sampled something, it shouldn\u2019t be a higher quote because\nit\u2019s going to make a lot of money or a lower quote because you want to cut him\na break.\n\nI\u2019m not known for getting crazy deals. I\u2019m known for getting a fair deal. The\nquote should be based on the use of the sample and that\u2019s really important. I\nthink sampling is an art and I think it\u2019s incredible. When I first started, I\nwas told how it was theft. I was told that hip-hop and rap was a phase. That\nit wasn\u2019t going to be around. All of that horrible, negative stuff. I kept\nsaying \u201cwell, a collage, that\u2019s not real art? Jambalaya isn\u2019t real food?\u201d\nThat\u2019s a great meal mixed up of different foods and spices, that\u2019s what\nsampling is. Remember when there was like six or seven samples in a song and\nthey used pieces of things like spice, adding little sounds to make something\ngreat? What about the fact that sampling took music and made it relevant\nagain? It brought James Brown back to life. I don\u2019t care what anyone says, it\nbrought attention to artists that people didn\u2019t even remember.\n\nDo you ever see great songs not make full-length albums because of sampling\nissues?\n\nI\u2019ve seen a few things not make it because of denial. I think my favourite one\nthat didn\u2019t make it, was due to death. It was Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard with Macy\nGray, being really drunk. You can find them on YouTube, doing \"Don't Go\nBreaking My Heart,\" which I had cleared and then they didn't release. I think\nit was released on illegal mixtapes. That was brilliant. That was great, one\nof my favourites. I'm going to go listen to that.\n\nRecording artist Sean 'Puff Daddy' Combs is one of Mannis-Gardner's famous\nclients and knew him as... [+] an intern. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images\nfor iHeartMedia)\n\nSince the jury\u2019s decision that Robin Thicke\u2019s \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d infringes on\nMarvin Gaye\u2019s \"Got To Give It Up,\" have you seen songwriters worried about\nbeing sued because something sounds similar?\n\nWell, I mean people have come to me saying \u201cI\u2019ve got a Robin Thicke\nsituation,\u201d and I say \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a Robin Thicke situation.\u201d\nYou\u2019ve either sampled or interpolated something or you didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t believe\nthere\u2019s such a thing as having the same feel or similarity. Inspiration is not\ncopyrightable. I mean if you think about it, The Beatles were influenced by\nChuck Berry. The Rolling Stones were influenced by Muddy Waters, and let\u2019s\ntalk about Marvin Gaye. Who influenced Marvin Gaye? Ray Charles, Frank\nSinatra. They even said that Marvin Gaye had the same style as Sam Cooke. So\nwhere do we take this? That\u2019s the whole basis of music.\n\nDo you think the lawsuit result could have long-term negative consequences?\n\nIt can have very bad consequences, and I look forward to Robin Thicke\u2019s people\nappealing the decision, which they have the right [to do]. I find the whole\nthing ludicrous and wrong. I think that there are consequences from what the\nMarvin estate has done. There have been other people, like I saw a YouTube\nclip of Stevie Wonder even disagreeing with the position of the Marvin Gaye\nestate, and he doesn\u2019t even allow his stuff to be sampled anymore. I\u2019m very\ndisappointed in the whole situation. I wasn\u2019t happy with the people that spoke\non behalf of the Marvin Gaye side. The fact that they sequestered and did not\nallow Dr. Ferrara\u2019s musicology report to be reviewed. He\u2019s the pre-eminent\nmusicologist that everyone uses in the hip-hop community whenever anyone\nquestions anything. He\u2019s the person that the Gaye Estate hired and then they\nwithdrew his report. So obviously he proved that Robin Thicke\u2019s people must\nhave been innocent, right?\n\nWas it easier for rap artists to clear samples in the 90s?\n\nI think it depends. It was a mixture of things. Samples were done a lot\ndifferently. In the late 80s/early 90s, we were able to do buyouts when you\npaid a one time fee. You didn\u2019t owe any other money. We\u2019d get some pretty good\ndeals. We would do a $500 buyout for a James Brown \u201chey, hey\u201d on a Me Phi Me\nsong. But that period ended when they were like \u201coh, I guess this genre is\nhere to stay.\u201d\n\n#### Gallery: Cash Kings 2015: The World\u2019s Highest Paid Hip-Hop Acts\n\n23 images\n\nView gallery\n\nDo you think \u201curban music\u201d is unfairly targeted when it comes to lawsuits?\n\nI\u2019ve been saying that for a long time. Not just lawsuits, but you can hear a\nprogression and if it\u2019s rap music, you run out and clear it. But if you hear\nthat same progression in an alternative rock song that you\u2019re listening to on\nSirius Radio, they are like \u201coh yeah, I guess it sounds like The Violent\nFemmes, but I\u2019m definitely not going to put a claim in on that. \u201c That\u2019s rock\nand roll, they all have those same kinds of feelings or chord progressions,\nbut once you flip it to this genre of music, it\u2019s a \u201cclaim.\u201d I\u2019ve always said\nthat, I think it\u2019s very unfair.\n\nWere you involved in the \u201cBig Pimpin\u2019\u201d case where Osama Fahmy sued Jay Z and\nTimbaland?\n\nI was not, but it was Dr. Ferrara who was the won who the case for Jay Z. He\u2019s\nbrilliant. When we did Kendrick Lamar\u2019s album, I had my in-house guy listen to\neverything, months prior, and everything we doubted or questioned, we sent to\nDr. Ferrara for final decision making.\n\nHow was working with Diddy when he was an intern?\n\nI knew him when he was an intern, but I did start in the very beginning when\nBad Boy opened. I had run into Francesca Spero at some business lunch, and\nshe\u2019s like \u201coh yeah, I\u2019m going to be going in with Puff and starting this\ncompany.\u201d And I\u2019m like \u201cwhat!?\u201d Then it all started.\n\nI just did Puffy\u2019s last album [MMM]. I mean it was still a good-sized, Puffy\nbudget. He likes to sample. He has creative way and he likes the way the\nsamples are used and his budget stayed the same [as it did when albums had\nbigger budgets].\n\nYou also handle all of the sample clearances for Cash Money. What\u2019s the most\nheated battle you\u2019ve had over a sample for them?\n\nI guess Tyga, but that didn\u2019t come across my desk. Tyga just did what Tyga\ndoes. He included stuff on his album Careless World: Rise Of The Last King\nthat none of us were aware of and that\u2019s why he got the cease and desist. He\nincluded a speech he wasn\u2019t supposed to include on there. They actually had to\npull it and re-release it.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most expensive sample you\u2019ve cleared?\n\nIt was a six-figure deal, and the attorney was involved and really cut the\ndeal. I actually went on record saying I was against the deal. It was a bad\nprecedent. It was a writer who doesn\u2019t allow sampling, did it for six figures\nand hasn\u2019t done a deal since.\n\nWhat can the artist do if they don\u2019t have the money to pay for a sample?\n\nIf they don\u2019t have the money, they need to replay it or re-sing it and that\neliminates two thirds of your cost. So that\u2019s a big saving.\n\nHow often do the copyright holders have to hear the sample before it\u2019s\ncleared?\n\n99.99%. If I\u2019m working with Marshall [Eminem] or Kendrick, who don\u2019t want\ntheir stuff sent out, we do it over the phone.\n\nHave there been any recent uses of sampling that have truly impressed you?\n\nKendrick\u2019s album that I worked on [To Pimp A Butterfly], we had the raw\nversions, unpolished, before it was mastered. There were like five to seven\nproducers on each song and the uses of the samples and the mixing and\neverything they did, gave me complete goosebumps. I didn\u2019t like as much the\nfinished product, because it was a little bit polished. I guess I liked it a\nlittle bit rougher, but it was goosebumps just listening to \u201cKing Kunta\u201d and\nall of that. Every aspect of that was a thrill and it had been a while since I\nhad gotten a thrill listening to something.\n\nI feel like old-fashioned artists would sometimes deny rap samples just on the\nfact they don\u2019t like the genre.\n\nYeah, you get that, but you can\u2019t take no as a first answer, at least in my\noffice. I had an intern here, who got a \u201cno\u201d and said \u201cok\u201d and hung up the\nphone. You can\u2019t do that. Your job is to find out \u201cwhy did I get the answer\nno? What is so horrible?\u201d Until someone has explained why their answer is no\nand can justify it, you can\u2019t accept that. They might say \u201cwell, I didn\u2019t like\nthe lyrical content\u201d and I\u2019ll go \u201cokay, let\u2019s see how we can change the\nlyrical content and make it acceptable.\u201d\n\nReally, someone would go as far as changing the lyrics because they wanted the\nsample?\n\nYeah, absolutely. You never know.\n\nIf the artist doesn\u2019t like a cover of their song, do they have a legal right\nto sue?\n\nThat law doesn\u2019t apply in the United States, that law applies in your country\n[England]. Enya is a great example. Puffy went to sample Enya and she\ninitially denied it, which of course Puff doesn\u2019t like, and Puff got on the\nphone with her and got it reversed and got it approved. But the whole basis\nwas, Enya can deny covers. I was like \u201chow is that possible?\u201d and that\u2019s where\nI learned about copyright outside the United States.\n\nI\u2019d like to imagine what a conversation between Enya and Diddy would be like.\n\nThe brilliance of Puff is... a lot of meetings had taken place and initially\nDavid Bowie had denied Puff for a sample and I hooked it up with Henry Wrenn-\nMeleck and Puff\u2019s manager. Puff sat down with Bowie, years ago to make that\nhappen. [Deborah is referring to the Diddy song \u201cBeen Around The World\u201d, which\nsamples David Bowie\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Dance\u201d].\n\nWhen people would say \u201cno\u201d to Puff, we would get Puff to sit down and meet\nwith people. I have to tell you something, as much as the press covers him as,\nyou know, this big mouth, attitude, blah blah blah, there\u2019s a side of him,\nlike where he called a friend of mine, who is the manager of this band, and\nwhen he called himself he didn\u2019t even introduce himself as Puff. He introduced\nhimself by saying [shy, quiet voice] \u201chi... this is Sean Combs, also known as\nPuffy.\u201d That\u2019s how he introduced himself. He was very respectful, very polite.\nThere\u2019s another side of him that people don\u2019t always see, that I see and the\npeople that I\u2019ve introduced him to have seen.\n\nPassion of the Weiss\n\nWe're a group blog spearheaded by the squad from Passion of the Weiss...\n\n  * Editorial Standards\n  * Print\n  * Reprints & Permissions\n\n", "frontpage": false}
