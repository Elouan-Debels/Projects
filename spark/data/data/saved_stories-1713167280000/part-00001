Please consider expanding the lead to provide an accessible overview\nof all important aspects of the article. (June 2022)  \n---  \n  \nThe resource curse, also known as the paradox of plenty or the poverty\nparadox, is the phenomenon of countries with an abundance of natural resources\n(such as fossil fuels and certain minerals) having less economic growth, less\ndemocracy, or worse development outcomes than countries with fewer natural\nresources.^[1] There are many theories and much academic debate about the\nreasons for and exceptions to the adverse outcomes. Most experts believe the\nresource curse is not universal or inevitable but affects certain types of\ncountries or regions under certain conditions.^[2]^[3]\n\n## Thesis[edit]\n\nAs far back as in 1711, The Spectator noted, \"It is generally observed, that\nin countries of the greatest plenty there is the poorest living.\"^[4]\n\nThe idea that resources might be more of an economic curse than a blessing\nemerged in debates in the 1950s and the 1960s about the economic problems of\nlow and middle-income countries.^[5] In 1993 Richard Auty first used the term\nresource curse to describe how countries rich in mineral resources were unable\nto use that wealth to boost their economies and how, counter-intuitively,\nthese countries had lower economic growth than countries without an abundance\nof natural resources. An influential 1995 study by Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew\nWarner found a strong correlation between natural resource abundance and poor\neconomic growth.^[6] As of 2016, hundreds of studies have evaluated the\neffects of resource wealth on a wide range of economic outcomes, and offered\nmany explanations for how, why, and when a resource curse is likely to\noccur.^[2]^[7] While \"the lottery analogy has value but also has\nshortcomings\",^[8] many observers have likened the resource curse to the\ndifficulties that befall lottery winners who struggle to manage the complex\nside-effects of newfound wealth.^[9]^[10]^[11]^[12]\n\nAs of 2009, scholarship on the resource curse has increasingly shifted towards\nexplaining why some resource-rich countries succeed and why others do not, as\nopposed to just investigating the average economic effects of resources.^[13]\nResearch suggests that the manner in which resource income is spent, the\nsystem of government, institutional quality, type of resources, and early vs.\nlate industrialization all have been used to explain successes and\nfailures.^[13]\n\nSince 2018, a discussion has emerged concerning the potential for a resource\ncurse related to critical materials for renewable energy.^[14] This could\nconcern either countries with abundant renewable energy resources, such as\nsunshine, or critical materials for renewable energy technologies, such as\nneodymium, cobalt, or lithium.\n\nBruce Bueno de Mesquita, who developed selectorate theory, explains that when\nan autocratic country has lots of natural resources, the ruler's optimal\nstrategy for political survival is to use that revenue to buy the loyalty of\ncritical support groups and oppress the rest of the population by denying them\ncivil liberties and underfunding education and infrastructure. Education,\nliberty, and infrastructure can make the people more productive, but they also\nmake it easier for them to organize opposition movements. Since the ruler can\nobtain sufficient revenue from his country's natural resources, he has no need\nfor a productive populace and therefore does not have to risk liberalization.\nBy contrast, in a dictatorship with few natural resources, there may be a\nnecessity for the ruler to liberalize his society somewhat so that the economy\ncan be organized more efficiently, and to invest in education and healthcare\nto create a skilled and healthy workforce. Bueno de Mesquita cites Ghana and\nTaiwan as examples of countries where the rulers permitted democratization out\nof necessity.^[15]\n\n## Economic effects[edit]\n\nThe International Monetary Fund classifies 51 countries as \"resource-rich,\"\nwhich are defined as countries that derive at least 20% of exports or 20% of\nfiscal revenue from nonrenewable natural resources; 29 of those countries are\nlow- and lower-middle-income. Common characteristics of the 29 countries\ninclude (i) extreme dependence on resource wealth for fiscal revenues, export\nsales, or both; (ii) low saving rates; (iii) poor growth performance; and (iv)\nhighly volatile resource revenues.^[2]\n\nA 2016 meta-study found weak support for the thesis that resource richness\nadversely affects long-term economic growth.^[16] The authors noted that\n\"approximately 40% of empirical papers finding a negative effect, 40% finding\nno effect, and 20% finding a positive effect\" but \"overall support for the\nresource curse hypothesis is weak when potential publication bias and method\nheterogeneity are taken into account.\"^[16]\n\nA 2018 study showed that most specifications, the impact of oil correlated\nwith regime leaders as well as being between two and three times larger than\nthe marginal effect of increases during the leader's term.^[clarification\nneeded]^[17]\n\nA 2021 meta-analysis of 46 natural experiments found that price increases in\noil and lootable minerals increased the likelihood of conflict.^[18] A 2011\nstudy in the journal Comparative Political Studies found that \"natural\nresource wealth can be either a \"curse\" or a \"blessing\" and that the\ndistinction is conditioned by domestic and international factors, both\namenable to change through public policy, namely, human capital formation and\neconomic openness.\"^[19]\n\n### Dutch disease[edit]\n\nMain article: Dutch disease\n\nDutch disease, defined as the relationship between the increase in the\neconomic development of a specific sector (for example natural resources) and\na decline in other sectors, first became apparent after the Dutch discovered a\nhuge natural gas field in Groningen in 1959. The Netherlands sought to tap\nthis resource in an attempt to export the gas for profit. However, when the\ngas began to flow out of the country, its ability to compete against other\ncountries' exports declined. With the Netherlands focusing primarily on the\nnew gas exports, the Dutch currency began to appreciate, which harmed the\ncountry's ability to export other products. With the growing gas market and\nthe shrinking export economy, the Netherlands began to experience a recession.\n\nThis process has been witnessed in multiple countries around the world\nincluding but not limited to Venezuela (oil), Angola (diamonds, oil), the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (diamonds), and various other nations. All of\nthese countries are considered \"resource-cursed\".^[20]\n\nDutch disease makes tradable goods less competitive in world markets. Absent\ncurrency manipulation or a currency peg, appreciation of the currency can\ndamage other sectors, leading to a compensating unfavorable balance of trade.\nAs imports become cheaper in all sectors, internal employment suffers and with\nit the skill infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities of the nation. To\ncompensate for the loss of local employment opportunities, government\nresources are used to artificially create employment. The increasing national\nrevenue will often also result in higher government spending on health,\nwelfare, military, and public infrastructure, and if this is done corruptly or\ninefficiently it can be a burden on the economy. While the decrease in the\nsectors exposed to international competition leaves the economy vulnerable to\nprice changes in the natural resource and consequently even greater dependence\non natural resource revenue, this can be managed by active and effective use\nof hedge instruments such as forwards, futures, options, and swaps; however,\nif it is managed inefficiently or corruptly, this can lead to disastrous\nresults. Also, since productivity generally increases faster in the\nmanufacturing sector than in the government, the economy will have lower\nproductivity gains than before.\n\nAccording to a 2020 study, giant resource discoveries led to a substantial\nappreciation of the real exchange rate.^[21]\n\n### Revenue volatility[edit]\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(January 2016) (Learn how\nand when to remove this template message)  \n---  \n  \nPrices for some natural resources are subject to wide fluctuation; for\nexample, crude oil prices rose from around $3 per barrel to $12/bbl in 1974\nfollowing the 1973 oil crisis and fell from $27/bbl to below $10/bbl during\nthe 1986 glut. In the decade from 1998 to 2008, it rose from $10/bbl to\n$145/bbl, before falling by more than half to $60/bbl over a few months. When\ngovernment revenues are dominated by inflows from natural resources (for\nexample, 99.3% of Angola's exports came from just oil and diamonds in\n2005),^[22] the volatility can disrupt government planning and debt service.\nAbrupt changes in economic realities that result from this often provoke\nwidespread breaking of contracts or curtailment of social programs, eroding\nthe rule of law and popular support. Responsible use of financial hedges can\nmitigate that risk to some extent.^[citation needed]\n\nSusceptibility to that volatility can be increased when governments choose to\nborrow heavily in foreign currency. Real exchange rate increases, through\ncapital inflows or the \"Dutch disease\" can make it appear an attractive option\nby lowering the cost of interest payments on the foreign debt, and they may be\nconsidered more creditworthy because of the existence of natural resources. If\nthe resource prices fall, however, the governments' capacity to meet debt\nrepayments will be reduced. For example, many oil-rich countries like Nigeria\nand Venezuela saw rapid expansions of their debt burdens during the 1970s oil\nboom; however, when oil prices fell in the 1980s, bankers stopped lending to\nthem and many of them fell into arrears, triggering penalty interest charges\nthat made their debts grow even more.^[citation needed] As Venezuelan oil\nminister and OPEC co-founder Juan Pablo P\u00e9rez Alfonzo presciently warned in\n1976: \"Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see, oil will bring\nus ruin... It is the devil's excrement.\"^[23]\n\nA 2011 study in The Review of Economics and Statistics found that commodities\nhave historically always shown greater price volatility than manufactured\ngoods and that globalization has reduced this volatility.^[24] Commodities are\na key reason why poor countries are more volatile than rich countries.^[24]\n\n### Enclave effects [edit]\n\n\"Oil production generally takes place in an economic enclave, meaning it has\nfew direct effects on the rest of the economy.\" Michael Ross describes how\nthere are limited economic linkages with other industries in the economy.\nConsequently, economic diversification may be delayed or neglected by the\nauthorities in light of the high profits that can be obtained from limited\nnatural resources. The attempts at diversification that do occur are often\nwhite elephant public works projects which may be misguided or mismanaged.\nHowever, even when the authorities attempt diversification in the economy,\nthis is made difficult because resource extraction is vastly more lucrative\nand out-competes other industries for the best human capital and capital\ninvestment. Successful natural-resource-exporting countries often become\nincreasingly dependent on extractive industries over time, further increasing\nthe levels of investment in this industry as it is necessary to maintain their\nstates' finances. There is a lack of investment in other sectors of the\neconomy which is further exacerbated by declines the commodity's price. While\nresource sectors tend to produce large financial revenues, they often add few\njobs to the economy, and tend to operate as enclaves with few forward and\nbackward connections to the rest of the economy.^[25]\n\n### Human capital[edit]\n\nAnother possible effect of the resource curse is the crowding out of human\ncapital; countries that rely on natural resource exports may tend to neglect\neducation because they see no immediate need for it. Resource-poor economies\nlike Singapore, Taiwan or South Korea, by contrast, spent enormous efforts on\neducation, and this contributed in part to their economic success (see East\nAsian Tigers). Other researchers, however, dispute this conclusion; they argue\nthat natural resources generate easily taxable rents that can result in\nincreased spending on education.^[26] However, the evidence for whether this\nincreased spending translates to better education outcomes is mixed. A study\non Brazil found that oil revenues were associated with sizable increases in\neducation spending, but only with small improvements in education\nprovision.^[27] Similarly, an analysis of early-20th century oil booms in\nTexas and neighboring states found no effect of oil discoveries on student\nteacher ratios or school attendance. However, oil-rich regions participated\nmore intensively in the Rosenwald schoolbuilding program.^[28] A 2021 study\nfound that European regions with a history of coal mining had 10% smaller per-\ncapita GDP than comparable regions. The authors attribute this to lower\ninvestments in human capital.^[29]\n\nResource extraction driven economies can be argued to potentially have\nnegative effects on human capital through several different means. \"Addictive\neconomies\" is a term that was coined by William Freudenburg to describe how\nresource extraction driven economies can lead to short term economic benefits\nand sometimes short-sightedness by policymakers. Freudenberg also did research\nin an effort to understand more of the human capital implications of these\ntypes of economies and why results vary so widely across regions and\nindustries. Although there is plentiful research of these types of economies,\nan understanding of the socioeconomic effects are still murky. Researchers\nRobert Purdue and Gregory Pavela did research on the West Virginia coal mining\neconomy to further investigate these concerns. Their research includes data\nfrom all of West Virginia's 55 counties over a 13-year period of (1997-2009).\nIn this research, significant ecological costs can be noted in the area which,\nin turn, effect the people negatively. The research also poses the fact that\nWest Virginia ranked last on the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index in the\nyears of 2009-2010 in the categories of \"physical health\", \"emotional health\",\n\"life evaluation\", and \"overall well-being\". Arguments against the \"resource\ncurse\" often claim economic benefits from the resource. The Purdue and Pavela\ncase study reflects an example of negative economic impacts of this type of\nreliance on resource extraction; as even when the price of surface level coal\ngoes up on the market, the poverty levels of people within those communities\nrises alongside it.^[30]\n\nAdverse effects of natural resources on human capital formation might come\nthrough several channels. High wages in the resource extraction industry could\ninduce young workers to drop out of school earlier in order to find\nemployment. Evidence for this has been found for coal^[31] and fracking\nbooms.^[32] In addition, resource booms can lower the wages of teachers\nrelative to other workers, increasing turnover and impairing students'\nlearning.^[33]\n\n### Incomes and employment[edit]\n\nA study on coal mining in Appalachia suggests that \"the presence of coal in\nthe Appalachian region has played a significant part in its slow pace of\neconomic development. Our best estimates indicate that an increase of 0.5\nunits in the ratio of coal revenues to personal income in a county is\nassociated with a 0.7 percentage point decrease in income growth rates. No\ndoubt, coal mining provides opportunities for relatively high-wage employment\nin the region, but its effect on prosperity appears to be negative in the\nlonger run.\"^[34]\n\nAnother example was the Spanish Empire which obtained enormous wealth from its\nresource-rich colonies in South America in the sixteenth century. The large\ncash inflows from silver reduced incentives for industrial development in\nSpain. Innovation and investment in education were therefore neglected, so\nthat the prerequisites for successful future development were given up. Thus,\nSpain soon lost its economic strength in comparison to other Western\ncountries.^[35]\n\nA study of US oil booms found positive effects on local employment and income\nduring booms but found that after the boom, incomes \"per capita\" decreased,\nwhile \"unemployment compensation payments increased relative to what they\nwould have been if the boom had not occurred.\"^[36]\n\n### Tradeable sectors[edit]\n\nA 2019 study found that active mining activity had an adverse impact on the\ngrowth of firms in tradeable sectors but a positive impact on the growth of\nfirms in non-tradeable sectors.^[37]\n\n## Other effects[edit]\n\nNatural resources are a source of economic rent which can generate large\nrevenues for those controlling them even in the absence of political stability\nand wider economic growth. Their existence is a potential source of conflict\nbetween factions fighting for a share of the revenue, which may take the form\nof armed separatist conflicts in regions where the resources are produced or\ninternal conflict between different government ministries or departments for\naccess to budgetary allocations. This tends to erode governments' abilities to\nfunction effectively.^[38]^[39]\n\nEven when politically stable, countries whose economies are dominated by\nresource extraction industries tend to be less democratic and more\ncorrupt.^[40]^[41]\n\n### Violence and conflict[edit]\n\nA 2019 meta-analysis of 69 studies found \"that there is no aggregate\nrelationship between natural resources and conflict.\"^[42] According to a 2017\nreview study, \"while some studies support the link between resource\nscarcity/abundance and armed conflict, others find no or only weak\nlinks.\"^[43] According to one academic study, a country that is otherwise\ntypical but has primary commodity exports around 5% of GDP has a 6% risk of\nconflict, but when exports are 25% of GDP the chance of conflict rises to\n33%.^[44] \"Ethno-political groups are more likely to resort to rebellion\nrather than using nonviolent means or becoming terrorists when representing\nregions rich in oil.\"^[45]\n\nThere are several factors behind the relationship between natural resources\nand armed conflicts.^[3] Resource wealth may increase the vulnerability of\ncountries to conflicts by undermining the quality of governance and economic\nperformance^[46] (the \"resource curse\" argument). Secondly, conflicts can\noccur over the control and exploitation of resources and the allocation of\ntheir revenues (the \"resource war\" argument). Thirdly, access to resource\nrevenues by belligerents can prolong conflicts (the \"conflict resource\"\nargument).^[47]^[48] A 2018 study in the Journal of Conflict Resolution found\nthat rebels were particularly likely to be able to prolong their participation\nin civil wars when they had access to natural resources that they could\nsmuggle.^[49]\n\nA 2004 literature review finds that oil makes the onset of war more likely and\nthat lootable resources lengthen existing conflicts.^[50] One study finds the\nmere discovery (as opposed to just the exploitation) of petroleum resources\nincreases the risk of conflict, as oil revenues have the potential to alter\nthe balance of power between regimes and their opponents, rendering bargains\nin the present obsolete in the future.^[51] One study suggests that the rise\nin mineral prices over the period 1997\u20132010 contributed to up to 21 percent of\nthe average country-level violence in Africa.^[52] Research shows that\ndeclining oil prices make oil-rich states less bellicose.^[53] Jeff Colgan\nobserved that oil-rich states have a propensity to instigate international\nconflicts as well as to be the targets of them, which he referred to as\n\"petro-aggression\".^[54]^[55] Arguable examples include Iraq's invasions of\nIran and Kuwait; Libya's repeated incursions into Chad in the 1970s and 1980s;\nIran's long-standing suspicion of Western powers; the United States' relations\nwith Iraq and Iran. It is not clear whether the pattern of petro-aggression\nfound in oil-rich countries also applies to other natural resources besides\noil.^[54] Some scholars argue that the relationship between oil and interstate\nwar is primarily driven by the case of the Iran\u2013Iraq War and that the overall\nevidence points in the direction of an oil-peace.^[56]\n\nA 2016 study finds that \"oil production, oil reserves, oil dependence, and oil\nexports are associated with a higher risk of initiating conflict while\ncountries enjoying large oil reserves are more frequently the target of\nmilitary actions.\"^[57] As of 2016, the only six countries whose reported\nmilitary expenditures exceeded 6 percent of GDP were significant oil\nproducers: Oman, South Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Libya, Algeria (data for\nSyria and North Korea were unavailable).^[58] A 2017 study in the American\nEconomic Review found that mining extraction contributed to conflicts in\nAfrica at the local level over the period 1997\u20132010.^[59] A 2017 study in\nSecurity Studies found that while there is a statistical relationship between\noil wealth and ethnic war, the use of qualitative methods reveals \"that oil\nhas rarely been a deep cause of ethnic war.\"^[60]\n\nThe emergence of the Sicilian Mafia has been attributed to the resource curse.\nEarly Mafia activity is strongly linked^[qualify evidence] to Sicilian\nmunicipalities abundant in sulphur, Sicily's most valuable export\ncommodity.^[61] A 2017 study in the Journal of Economic History also\nlinks^[qualify evidence] the emergence of the Sicilian Mafia to surging demand\nfor oranges and lemons following the late 18th-century discovery that citrus\nfruits cured scurvy.^[62]\n\nA 2016 study argues that petrostates may be emboldened to act more\naggressively because of the inability of allied great powers to punish the\npetrostate.^[63] The great powers have strong incentives not to upset the\nrelationship with its client petrostate ally for both strategic and economic\nreasons.^[63]\n\nA 2017 study found evidence of the resource curse in the American frontier\nperiod of the Western United States in the 19th century (the Wild West).^[64]\nThe study found, \"In places where mineral discoveries occurred before formal\ninstitutions were established, there were more homicides per capita\nhistorically and the effect has persisted to this day. Today, the share of\nhomicides and assaults explained by the historical circumstances of mineral\ndiscoveries is comparable to the effect of education or income.\"^[64]\n\nA 2018 study in the Economic Journal found that \"oil price shocks are seen to\npromote coups in onshore-intensive oil countries, while preventing them in\noffshore-intensive oil countries.\"^[65] The study argues that states which\nhave onshore oil wealth tend to build up their military to protect the oil,\nwhereas states do not do that for offshore oil wealth.^[65] A 2020 study\ndetermined that low levels of oil and gas revenue actually increases the\nlikelihood of nonviolent resistance in autocratic countries, despite the\ngeneral logic of the resource curse.^[66]\n\n### Democracy and human rights[edit]\n\nSee also: Rentier state\n\nThis section may be too long to read and navigate comfortably.

(November 2022)  \n---  \n  \nResearch shows that oil wealth lowers levels of democracy and strengthens\nautocratic rule because political leaders in oil-rich countries refuse\ndemocratic development because they will have more to give up from losing\npower. Similarly, political leaders of oil-rich countries refuse democratic\ndevelopment because the political elite collects the revenues from the oil\nexport and use the money for cementing its political, economic, and social\npower by controlling government and its bureaucracy,^[67]^[68]^[69]^[70]\nMilitary spending generally increases with oil wealth and so a military coup,\none of the strongest tools in toppling autocracies, is less likely in oil-rich\ncountries since dictators can quell resistance through additional\nfunding.^[71] According to Michael Ross, \"only one type of resource has been\nconsistently correlated with less democracy and worse institutions: petroleum,\nwhich is the key variable in the vast majority of the studies that identify\nsome type of curse.\"^[3] A 2014 meta-analysis confirms the negative impact of\noil wealth on democratization.^[72] A 2016 study challenges the conventional\nacademic wisdom on the relationship between oil and authoritarianism.^[73] A\n2022 study found that the resource curse is tied only to easily-extractable\noil, not to oil that requires complex extraction.^[74] Other forms of resource\nwealth have also been found to strengthen autocratic rule.^[75] A 2016 study\nfound that resource windfalls have no political impact on democracies and\ndeeply entrenched authoritarian regimes, but significantly exacerbate the\nautocratic nature of moderately authoritarian regimes.^[76] A third 2016 study\nfinds that while it is accurate that resource richness has an adverse impact\non the prospects of democracy, this relationship has held only since the\n1970s.^[77] A 2017 study found that the presence of multinational oil\ncompanies increases the likelihood of state repression.^[78]^[79] Another 2017\nstudy found that the presence of oil reduced the likelihood that a democracy\nwould be established after the breakdown of an authoritarian regime.^[80] A\n2018 study found that the relationship between oil and authoritarianism\nprimarily holds after the end of the Cold War. The study argues that without\nAmerican or Soviet support, resource-poor authoritarian regimes had to\ndemocratize, but resource-rich authoritarian regimes resisted domestic\npressures to democratize.^[81] Prior to the 1970s, oil-producing countries did\nnot have democratization levels that differed from other countries.^[82] Oil-\nabundant authoritarian governments are suggested to earn high levels of income\nfor oil but spend an extremely minimal amount on social expenditures for\nindividuals being ruled and democracies are suggested to do the opposite.^[83]\n\nResearch by Stephen Haber and Victor Menaldo found that increases in natural\nresource reliance do not induce authoritarianism but may instead promote\ndemocratization.^[84]^[85]^[86] The authors say that their method rectifies\nthe methodological biases of earlier studies which revolve around random\neffects: \"Numerous sources of bias may be driving the results [of earlier\nstudies on the resource curse], the most serious of which is omitted variable\nbias induced by unobserved country-specific and time-invariant\nheterogeneity.\"^[84] In other words, this means that countries might have\nspecific, enduring traits that get left out of the model, which could increase\nthe explanation power of the argument. The authors claim that the chances of\nthis happening are larger when assuming random effects, an assumption that\ndoes not allow for what the authors call \"unobserved country-specific\nheterogeneity\".^[84] The criticisms have themselves been subject to criticism.\nOne study reexamined the Haber-Menaldo analysis by using Haber and Menaldo's\nown data and statistical models. It reported that their conclusions were only\nvalid for the period before the 1970s, but since about 1980, there has been a\npronounced resource curse. Authors Andersen and Ross suggest that oil wealth\nbecame a hindrance to democratic transitions only after the transformative\nevents of the 1970s, which enabled the governments of developing countries to\ncapture the oil rents that were previously siphoned off by foreign-owned\nfirms.\n\nThere are two ways that oil wealth might negatively affect democratization.\nThe first is that oil strengthens authoritarian regimes, making transitions to\ndemocracy less likely.^[3] The second is that oil wealth weakens\ndemocracies.^[3] Research generally supports the first theory but is mixed on\nthe second.^[3] A 2019 study found that oil wealth is associated with\nincreases in the level of personalism in dictatorships.^[87]\n\nBoth pathways might result from the ability of oil-rich states to provide\ncitizens with a combination of generous benefits and low taxes. In many\neconomies that are not resource-dependent, governments tax citizens, who\ndemand efficient and responsive government in return. This bargain establishes\na political relationship between rulers and subjects. In countries whose\neconomies are dominated by natural resources, however, rulers don't need to\ntax their citizens because they have a guaranteed source of income from\nnatural resources.^[88]^[89] Because the country's citizens aren't being\ntaxed, they have less incentive to be watchful with how government spends its\nmoney.^[90] In addition, those benefiting from mineral resource wealth may\nperceive an effective and watchful civil service and civil society as a threat\nto the benefits that they enjoy, and they may take steps to thwart them.^[40]\nAs a result, citizens are often poorly served by their rulers,^[91] and if the\ncitizens complain, money from the natural resources enables governments to pay\nfor armed forces to keep the citizens in check. It has been argued that rises\nand falls in the price of petroleum correlate with rises and falls in the\nimplementation of human rights in major oil-producing countries.^[92]^[93]\n\nCorrupt members of national governments may collude with resource extraction\ncompanies to override their own laws and ignore objections made by indigenous\ninhabitants.^[94] The United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee report\nentitled \"Petroleum and Poverty Paradox\" states that \"too often, oil money\nthat should go to a nation's poor ends up in the pockets of the rich, or it\nmay be squandered on grand palaces and massive showcase projects instead of\nbeing invested productively.\"^[95] A 2016 study found that mining in Africa\nsubstantially increases corruption; an individual within 50 kilometres (31 mi)\nof a recently opened mine is 33% more likely to have paid a bribe the past\nyear than a person living within 50 km of mines that \"will open\" in the\nfuture.^[96] The former also pay bribes for permits more frequently, and\nperceive their local councilors to be more corrupt.^[96] In a study examining\nthe effects of mining on local communities in Africa, researchers concluded\nthat active mining areas are associated with more bribe payments, particularly\npolice bribes.^[97] Their findings were consistent with the hypothesis that\nmining increases corruption.\n\nThe Center for Global Development argues that governance in resource-rich\nstates would be improved by the government making universal, transparent, and\nregular payments of oil revenues to citizens and then attempting to reclaim it\nthrough the tax system, which they argue will fuel public demand for the\ngovernment to be transparent and accountable in its management of natural\nresource revenues and in the delivery of public services.^[98]\n\nOne study found that \"oil producing states dependent on exports to the USA\nexhibit lower human rights performance than those exporting to China\". The\nauthors argue that this stems from the fact that US relationships with oil\nproducers were formed decades ago, before human rights became part of its\nforeign policy agenda.^[99]\n\nOne study found that resource wealth in authoritarian states lowers the\nprobability of adopting freedom of information laws.^[100] However,\ndemocracies that are resource-rich are more likely than resource-poor\ndemocracies to adopt such laws.^[100]\n\nOne study looking at oil wealth in Colombia found \"that when the price of oil\nrises, legislators affiliated with right-wing paramilitary groups win office\nmore in oil-producing municipalities. Consistent with the use of force to gain\npower, positive price shocks also induce an increase in paramilitary violence\nand reduce electoral competition: fewer candidates run for office, and winners\nare elected with a wider vote margin. Ultimately, fewer centrist legislators\nare elected to office, and there is diminished representation at the\ncenter.\"^[101]\n\nA 2018 study in International Studies Quarterly found that oil wealth was\nassociated with weaker private liberties (freedom of movement, freedom of\nreligion, the right to property, and freedom from forced labor).^[102]\n\nResearch by Nathan Jensen indicates that countries that have resource wealth\nare considered to have a greater political risk for foreign direct investors.\nHe argues that this is because leaders in resource-rich countries are less\nsensitive to being punished in elections if they take actions that adversely\naffect foreign investors.^[103]^[104] Countries with higher natural resource\nexport share show a correlation between receiving Foreign direct investment\nand decreasing democracy index, while this correlation is opposite for\ncountries with low natural resource export share.^[105]\n\n### Distribution[edit]\n\nAccording to a 2017 study, \"social forces condition the extent to which oil-\nrich nations provide vital public services to the population. Although it is\noften assumed that oil wealth leads to the formation of a distributive state\nthat generously provides services in the areas of water, sanitation,\neducation, health care, or infrastructure... quantitative tests reveal that\noil-rich nations who experience demonstrations or riots provide better water\nand sanitation services than oil-rich nations who do not experience such\ndissent. Subsequent tests find that oil-rich nations who experience\nnonviolent, mass-based movements provide better water and sanitation services\nthan those who experience violent, mass-based movements.\"^[106]\n\n### Gender inequality[edit]\n\nStudies suggest countries with abundant natural resources have higher levels\nof gender inequality in the areas of wages, labor force participation,\nviolence, and education. Research links gender inequality in the Middle East\nto resource wealth.^[107] According to Michael Ross:\n\n> Oil production affects gender relations by reducing the presence of women in\n> the labor force. The failure of women to join the nonagricultural labor\n> force has profound social consequences: it leads to higher fertility rates,\n> less education for girls, and less female influence within the family. It\n> also has far-reaching political consequences: when fewer women work outside\n> the home, they are less likely to exchange information and overcome\n> collective action problems; less likely to mobilize politically, and to\n> lobby for expanded rights; and less likely to gain representation in\n> government. That leaves oil-producing states with atypically strong\n> patriarchal cultures and political institutions.^[107]\n\nRoss argues that in oil-rich countries, across the Middle East, Africa, Latin\nAmerica, and Asia, the need for female labor reduces as export-oriented and\nfemale-dominated manufacturing is ousted by Dutch disease effects.^[108] This\nhypothesis has received further support by the analysis of mining booms in\nAfrica.^[109] For the United States, the evidence is mixed. State-level\ncomparisons suggest that resource wealth leads to lower levels of female labor\nforce participation, lower turnout and fewer seats held by women in\nlegislatures.^[110] On the other hand, a county-level analysis of resource\nbooms in the early 20th century found an overall positive effect of resource\nwealth on single women's labor force participation.^[111]\n\nResearch has also linked resource wealth to greater domestic violence,^[112]\nand a gender gap in education.^[113]^[114]\n\n### International cooperation[edit]\n\nResearch finds that the more that states depend on oil exports, the less\ncooperative they become. They become less likely to join intergovernmental\norganizations, accept the compulsory jurisdiction of international judicial\nbodies, and agree to binding arbitration for investment disputes.^[115]\n\n### Foreign aid[edit]\n\nThere is an argument in political economy that foreign aid can have the same\nnegative effects in the long run towards development as in the case of the\nresource curse. The so-called \"aid curse\" results from giving perverse\npolitical incentives to a weak body of civil servants, lowering politicians'\naccountability towards citizens and decreasing economic pressure thanks to the\nincome of an unearned resource to mitigate economic crisis.^[116] When foreign\naid represents a major source of revenue to governments, especially in low-\nincome countries, state-building capacity is hindered by undermining\nresponsiveness toward taxpayers or by decreasing the incentive for governments\nto look for different sources of income or the increase in taxation.^[117]\n\n### Crime[edit]\n\nA 2018 study found that in Texas, \"a 1% increase in the value of oil reserves\nincreases murder by 0.16%, robbery by 0.55% and larceny by 0.18%.\"^[118]\n\n## Petro-aggression[edit]\n\nSee also: Oil war\n\nPetro-aggression is the tendency for a petrostate to be involved in\ninternational conflicts, or to be the target of them. The term was popularized\nby a 2013 book by Jeff Colgan that found that petrostates (states with 10% or\nmore GDP from petroleum) are 250 percent more likely to instigate\ninternational conflicts than a typical country.^[119]^[120]\n\nExamples of oil-rich countries engaging in conflict include:\n\n  * Iraq (invasion of Kuwait)\n  * Iran (support of Hezbollah and other Shia militias)\n  * Libya (Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict)\n  * Biafra\n  * Indonesia (Operation Lotus)\n  * Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, Yemeni Civil War (2014\u2013present))\n  * Russia (War in Donbas,^[121] Russian invasion of Ukraine^[122])\n  * South Sudan (South Sudanese Civil War)\n\nAs of 1999, it remained unclear whether the pattern of petro-aggression found\nin oil-rich countries also applies to other natural resources besides\noil.^[123]\n\nOil-rich states also tend to have a poor record of human rights abuses, as\nwell as revolutionary, revisionist ambitions, making them more conflict-prone.\nUnfortunately, the lack of data allows no way of discerning high oil prices\nturning petro-states more aggressive as public thought might deduce. Natural\ndisasters turn out to be far more hurtful to the price of oil than any\nconflict.^[original research?]\n\n## Examples in biology and ecology[edit]\n\nMicrobial ecology studies have also addressed if resource availability\nmodulates the cooperative or competitive behaviour in bacteria populations.\nWhen resources availability is high, bacterial populations become competitive\nand aggressive with each other, but when environmental resources are low, they\ntend to be cooperative and mutualistic.^[124]\n\nEcological studies have hypothesised that competitive forces between animals\nare major in high carrying capacity zones (i.e. near the Equator), where\nbiodiversity is higher, because of natural resources abundance. This abundance\nor excess of resources, causes animal populations to have R reproduction\nstrategies (many offspring, short gestation, less parental care, and a short\ntime until sexual maturity), so competition is affordable for populations.\nAlso, competition could select populations to have R behaviour in a positive\nfeedback regulation.^[125]\n\nContrary, in low carrying capacity zones (i.e. far from the equator), where\nenvironmental conditions are harsh K strategies are common (longer life\nexpectancy, produce relatively fewer offspring and tend to be altricial,\nrequiring extensive care by parents when young) and populations tend to have\ncooperative or mutualistic behaviors. If populations have a competitive\nbehaviour in hostile environmental conditions they mostly are filtered out\n(die) by environmental selection, hence populations in hostile conditions are\nselected to be cooperative.^[126]\n\nMutualism hypothesis was first described while Peter Kropotkin studied the\nfauna of the Siberian steppe, where environmental conditions are harsh, he\nfound animals tend to cooperate in order to survive.^[127] Extreme competition\nis observed in the Amazonian forest where life requires low energy to find\nresources (i.e. sunlight for plants) hence life could afford being selected by\nbiotic factors (i.e. competition) rather than abiotic factors.^[128]\n\n## Criticisms[edit]\n\nA 2008 study argues that the curse vanishes when looking not at the relative\nimportance of resource exports in the economy but rather at a different\nmeasure: the relative abundance of natural resources in the ground. Using that\nvariable to compare countries, it reports that resource wealth in the ground\ncorrelates with slightly higher economic growth and slightly fewer armed\nconflicts. That a high dependency on resource exports correlates with bad\npolicies and effects is not caused by the large degree of resource\nexportation. The causation goes in the opposite direction: conflicts and bad\npolicies created the heavy dependence on exports of natural resources. When a\ncountry's chaos and economic policies scare off foreign investors and send\nlocal entrepreneurs abroad to look for better opportunities, the economy\nbecomes skewed. Factories may close and businesses may flee, but petroleum and\nprecious metals remain for the taking. Resource extraction becomes the\n\"default sector\" that still functions after other industries have come to a\nhalt.^[129]\n\nA 2008 article by Thad Dunning argues that while resource revenues can promote\nor strengthen authoritarian regimes, in certain circumstances they can also\npromote democracy. In countries where natural resource rents are a relatively\nsmall portion of the overall economy and the non-resource economy is unequal,\nresources rents can strengthen democracy by reducing economic elites' fear of\nceding power since social welfare policies can be funded with resource rents\nand not redistribution.^[130] Dunning proposes Venezuela's democratic\nconsolidation during the oil boom of the 1970s as a key example of this\nphenomenon.^[131]\n\nA 2011 study argues that previous assumptions that oil abundance is a curse\nwere based on methodologies which failed to take into account cross-country\ndifferences and dependencies arising from global shocks, such as changes in\ntechnology and the price of oil. The researchers studied data from the World\nBank over the period 1980\u20132006 for 53 countries, covering 85% of world GDP and\n81% of world proven oil reserves. They found that oil abundance positively\naffected both short-term growth and long-term income levels.^[132] In a\ncompanion paper, using data on 118 countries over the period 1970\u20132007, they\nshow that it is the volatility in commodity prices, rather than abundance per\nse, that drives the resource curse paradox.^[133]^[134]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Banana republic\n  * Dutch disease\n  * Exploitation colonialism\n  * Freight equalization policy in India\n  * High-level equilibrium trap\n  * Passive income\n\n    * Rent seeking\n    * Rentier capitalism\n    * Rentier state\n  * Petrostate\n  * Political corruption\n\n    * Bribery\n  * Public choice theory\n  * Resource monotonicity\n  * Unequal exchange\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Smith, Benjamin; Waldner, David (2021).
