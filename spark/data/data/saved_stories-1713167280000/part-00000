And it\u2019s the worst journalism idea I\u2019ve\nheard in a long time.\n\nNathaniel Brooks Horwitz and Sam Koppelman \u2014 both 27 years old \u2014 are creating\na newsroom that will be monetized by investments based on \u201cscoops\u201d produced by\nthe newsroom, according to exclusive reporting by the Financial Times.\n\nIn other words, their investment firm, the $100 million hedge fund Hunterbrook\nCapital, is using journalists to write stories designed to affect the stock\nmarket. They\u2019ll buy or sell stock based on those \u201cmarket-moving\u201d stories\nbefore the market moves \u2014 before other investors know about the stories \u2014\nthereby profiting.\n\nIf this feels wrong, it clearly is. Imagine them doing the same thing, hiring\njournalists, gathering the information, then not publishing the \u201cstories.\u201d\nThis practice \u2014 hiring journalists to do investment research \u2014 is somewhat\ncommon. That would be similar to current investment, where information is\ngathered, research is done, then investments made based on what was learned.\nThat would be ethical.\n\nThe cheat-code here is that that profit-taking results not from knowledge, but\naction that changes prices. They are placing bets on market changes, then\nactively and deliberately changing the market themselves.\n\nThe investors hawk their scam with virtue signaling about funding journalism.\nBut their model isn\u2019t about funding journalism for an informed democracy. It\u2019s\nabout funding journalism to change stock prices. (They claim journalists will\nnot be directed by the investment arm and will be free to write other stories\nthat won\u2019t be traded on. But reporters will know their purpose and will be\ngiven bonuses when their stories result in profitable trades. Their incentives\nare not journalistic incentives.)\n\nJournalists will be tasked with investigating companies and writing \u201cscoops,\u201d\nbut without using any information that isn\u2019t already public. In other words,\nHunterbrook doesn\u2019t know what a \u201cscoop\u201d is.\n\nThe reason they\u2019ll use only publicly available information is that trading on\nnon-public information is against the law.\n\nSo-called \u201ccompliance officers\u201d will check stories to make sure all the\ninformation in them is publically available.\n\nWhich is why they shouldn\u2019t call \u201cjournalism\u201d designed for investors to profit\nfrom advanced knowledge of the \u201cstories\u201d \u201cjournalism,\u201d nor should they refer\nto their market-manipulating content as \u201cscoops.\u201d\n\nRead the rest\n\n#\n\nMike\u2019s List of Must-Read Stories\n\n  1.
