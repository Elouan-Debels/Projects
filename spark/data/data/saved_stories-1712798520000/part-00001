Salehpour warns that production \"shortcuts\" could significantly\nshorten the lifespan of the plane, eventually causing the fuselage to fall\napart in mid-flight.\n\n\"It can cause a catastrophic failure,\" Salehpour said Tuesday during a press\nbriefing to discuss his claims.\n\nA spokesman for the FAA confirmed that the agency is investigating those\nallegations, which were first reported by the New York Times, but declined to\ncomment further on them.\n\nBoeing immediately pushed back.\n\n\"These claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do\nnot represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and\nlong-term safety of the aircraft,\" Boeing spokeswoman Jessica Kowal said in a\nstatement. \"We are fully confident in the 787 Dreamliner.\"\n\nRelated Story: How bad is Boeing's 2024 so far? Here's a timeline\n\nThe latest whistleblower allegations come at a difficult time for Boeing. The\ncompany was plunged into crisis in January when a door plug panel blew off a\n737 Max jet in midair, renewing troubling questions about quality and safety\nat the company. Last month, CEO Dave Calhoun announced he will step down at\nthe end of the year.\n\nThe concerns Salehpour raises with the 787 Dreamliner appear to be similar to\nthose that prompted the FAA to halt deliveries of the plane in 2021, when\nregulators found production flaws including unacceptable gaps between the\nfuselage panels.\n\nRelated Story: FAA toughens oversight of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner\n\nThe FAA subsequently approved Boeing's plans to revise its quality control and\nproduction processes, paving the way for the planemaker to resume 787\ndeliveries the following year.\n\nBut Salehpour and his lawyers argue that Boeing has never adequately addressed\nthose concerns. Instead, he says the company took \"shortcuts\" by applying\ngreater force to fit segments of the fuselage together.\n\n\"Boeing hid the problem by pushing the pieces together with force to make it\nappear like that the gap didn't exist,\" Salehpour told reporters at Tuesday's\npress briefing.\n\nSalehpour says he repeatedly raised these concerns with management, but\ninstead of addressing them, they transferred him to work on a different plane,\nthe 777, where he alleges he saw similar problems.\n\n\"I literally saw people jumping on the pieces of the airplane to get them to\nalign,\" he said. \"That's not how you build a plane.\"\n\nBoeing says it has conducted extensive testing, and that these issues \"will\nnot change or affect the expected lifespan of the 787 fuselages.\"\n\n\"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous engineering examination under\nFAA oversight. This analysis has validated that these issues do not present\nany safety concerns and the aircraft will maintain its service life over\nseveral decades,\" the company said in response to Salehpour's claims.\n\nThe 787 is made with lighter-weight composite materials, which help the\naircraft deliver greater fuel efficiency than older 767s and 777s. But the\nrollout of the Dreamliner has been troubled from the start.\n\nRelated Story: Boeing whistleblower John Barnett, who raised alarm over plane\nquality, is found dead\n\nThis is not the first time a Boeing whistleblower has raised concerns about\nthe 787.\n\nJohn Barnett, a former Boeing quality control manager, went public with a\nstring of problems he says he identified at the plant in South Carolina where\nhe once helped inspect the Dreamliner.\n\nBarnett was found dead in his truck of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot\nwound in March. Police in Charleston, S.C., are investigating. He was in the\nmidst of testifying in a deposition related to his wrongful termination\nlawsuit against the company.\n\nSalehpour faced retaliation from Boeing after raising his concerns internally,\naccording to his lawyers.\n\n\"He raised his hand again and again,\" said his attorney, Debra Katz. \"He was\nthreatened with physical violence. He was threatened with termination. He was\ntransferred off the 787. He has been punished repeatedly.\"\n\nIn its statement, Boeing said that all employees are encouraged to \"speak up\nwhen issues arise,\" and that \"retaliation is strictly prohibited at Boeing.\"\n\nSalehpour is expected to testify on Capitol Hill next week. The Permanent\nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security &\nGovernment Affairs will hold a hearing on April 17th titled \"Examining\nBoeing's Broken Safety Culture: Firsthand Accounts.\"\n\n\"I'm doing this not because I want Boeing to fail,\" Salehpour told reporters,\n\"but because I want it to succeed and prevent the crashes from happening.\"\n\n### CORRECTION\n\nApr. 9th, 2024\n\nIn an earlier version of this story, we said the FAA grounded the 787\nDreamliner in 2021. That is incorrect \u2013 the FAA only halted deliveries of the\nplane.\n\nClarification: The story also did not specify which plane Salehpour was\nreferencing in a quote. We have added that it was the 777 for clarity.\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": true}
