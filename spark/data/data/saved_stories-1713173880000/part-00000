There were tens of\nthousands of strikers and sympathizers, but only a few hundred police. A\nnumber of unemployed people were deputized, but they were quickly seen as\nworse than useless. \u201cSend in the troops\u201d became the establishment consensus.\n\n###\n\nBlue Island (Chicago suburbs)\n\nThis is the New York Times, July 2.\n\n> DEPUTIES OVERAWED BY STRIKERS\n>\n> Mob at Blue Island in control of Rock Island Tracks. -\n>\n> CHICAGO, July 2.\u2014The striking railroad men and sympathizing citizens of Blue\n> Island derided and defied an injunction issued by the United States court\n> today, and treated 300 law officers of the State and Federal Governments in\n> the same manner.\n>\n> Tonight the mob is in undisputed possession of the property of the Rock\n> Island Railroad Company. The employes of the brickyard in this vicinity,\n> numbering 1,000 men, will be on strike tomorrow in sympathy with the\n> American Railway Union boycott and the Rock Island strikers particularly.\n> Most of the brickyard men went out tonight, and will increase the size and\n> danger of the mob tomorrow morning.\n>\n> The force of Special Deputy Marshals and Sheriffs sent here are pronounced\n> by their commanders practically useless and by the strikers arrant cowards,\n> hiding behind cars and in them for fear of being hurt.\n>\n> The people of the town and the authorities have conspired not only to render\n> all the aid in their power to the strikers without getting in the meshes of\n> the law, but also to starve the civil officers by refusing them food and\n> threatening to boycott anyone who supplies it.\n>\n> Early in the day the mob became riotous, and only the discretion displayed\n> by United States Marshal Arnold and Chief Deputy Liebrandt prevented a\n> bloody conflict between the forces of law and order and those massed here\n> for the purpose of keeping the Rock Island tracks blocked to traffic as long\n> as Pullman cars are run by the railroad company.\n>\n> The presence of militia or of United States soldiers from Fort Sheridan is\n> requisite to open the Rock Island line and keep it open. [emphasis added]\n>\n> The strikers have no more respect for the authority of the Deputy Sheriffs\n> and Marshals than they have for the railroad property or the Officials of\n> the company who have been here all day trying to get trains moved. The\n> strikers know that the juvenile special deputies, gathered from anywhere in\n> a haphazard way, are afraid tc use their revolvers.\n>\n> At 6 o'clock tonight the track of the Rock Island. which is used for\n> suburban traffic in times of peace, was cleared of the string of passenger\n> coaches and baggage cars, after much trouble and and exciting brush with the\n> mob, but it was only kept clear long enough to allow the mail train from\n> Chicago. hauling four coaches, one mail and one baggage car, to proceed on\n> its way west, alter being held there for five hours. No hated Pullman car\n> was attached so the strikers silently allowed it to pass between them.\n>\n> This train left Blue Island at 6:40, and two hours afterward a gang of 200\n> strikers quietly gathered on the clear track just west of the station, where\n> they could not be seen by the main body of deputies, who were standing\n> outside the stalled and derailed express trains like so many wooden Indians,\n> or else taking it easy on the seats of the cars.\n>\n> Half a dozen freight cars stood on the track next to the clear one,\n> presenting a favorable spot for the obstructive and destructive tactics of\n> the strikers.\n>\n> Only ten Deputy Sheriffs were stationed at this spot to guard property, and\n> they were laughed at. As many strikers as could get a hand on a box car at\n> the end of the string took hold, and at the word all exerted their utmost\n> strength to tip the car on the clear track.\n>\n> It toppled clean over on its side leaving only one truck on the original\n> track, again closing the line to traffic. When general Superintendent Dunlop\n> heard that the line was blocked again, he said to a reporter for the United\n> Press:\n>\n> \u201cWe cannot open this line in a week without troops. This mob will keep us\n> closed until soldiers are on guard. The trouble is there is no organisation\n> or discipline, and not much bravery among the special deputies sent here.\n> The regular men are alright, but the other fellows mix with the crowd or\n> bunch together because they are afraid to be alone. I know ther\u00e9 are a dozen\n> switchmen who\u2019ve been sworn in as Deputy Marshals.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cThere are only 100 of our striking switchmen in this mob. The rest is made\n> up of switchmen and other railroad strikers from all parts of the city, most\n> of them coming from the Stock Yards. They have continued to keep our road\n> tied up here, and defy all authority. until backed by soldiers. Mayor\n> Zacharias of this place, all the members of the Council, and the whole local\n> police force and private citizens have done all that they could to obstruct\n> traffic.\n>\n> *The police even attempted to arrest the United States Marshal for keeping\n> the train on the street crossings for over five minutes.\u201d\n>\n> The injunction issued by Federal Judges Wood and Grosscup restraining all\n> persons from not only interfering with the moving of trains under penalty of\n> punishment for violation of the interstate and commerce law, but prohibiting\n> anyone from persuading anyone to desert trains, was brought to Blue Island\n> on the 11 o\u2019clock mail train by a posse of Deputy Marshals. The sweeping\n> order from the court was handed to United States Marshall Arnold, who called\n> upon the strikers to gather around him and listen.\n>\n> Three thousand men, women, and children quickly came within sound of his\n> voice. The Marshal stood on a car platform with other officials of the road.\n\n(I love the phrase \u201cwho were standing outside the stalled and derailed express\ntrains like so many wooden Indians, or else taking it easy on the seats of the\ncars. \u201c I can\u2019t imagine anyone writing that anymore.)\n\n###\n\nSacramento\n\nIn California there actually were troops. Here\u2019s the Sacramento Bee from July\n3.\n\n> Great Excitement In Chicago.\n>\n> The Stock Yards Are Tied Up.\n>\n> FRESH BEEF LEFT TO SPOIL\n>\n> A Clash of Arms on the Fourth Possible\n>\n> Railroads Not Anxious to Make Trouble\n>\n> TRAINS AND ROADS ABANDONED\n>\n> The Nickel Plate Road, Among Many Others, Stopped - A Passenger Train\n> Abandoned in a Swamp\n>\n> Chicago, July 3.\u2014With this morning's dawn opened what is expected to be a\n> day fraught with exciting events befitting the climax of the contest between\n> the great combatants in the great Pullman- American Railway Union strike.\n> Not until the small hours of this morning were yesterday's hostilities\n> suspended, and then for an hour or two, only to wait daylight that they\n> might be renewed with redoubled vigor. All night long from every section\n> west of Pittsburg [Pittsburg in California, not Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania]\n> came reports of strikes, tie-ups; of efforts by the roads, aided by\n> municipal, State and Federal officers to start moving the clogged wheels of\n> commerce, and of the determined resistance of such action on the part of the\n> strikers and their sympathizers.\n>\n> WHERE INTEREST CENTERS\n>\n> Interest centers principally on Blue Island. This town is eighteen miles out\n> of Chicago, where traffic on the Chicago, Rock island and Pacific is\n> effectually tied up despite the fact that several United States Deputy\n> Marshals are on hand, they being outnumbered ten to one by the strikers, who\n> are in anything but an amiable frame of mind. Every legal resource has been\n> tried in vain and the United States Marsbals are openly defied. Nothing\n> seems to remain but to invoke aid to get trains moving, and to this end\n> troops are held in readiness at Fort Sheridan.\n>\n> MARINE ENGINEERS INFECTED.\n>\n> Even the marine engineers have caught the infection and stand ready,\n> together with the elevated railway men to add their quota to the great army\n> of self-made idlers. What they expect to accomplish, or what assistance they\n> expect to be, in compelling Pullman to submit the differences between\n> himself and his late employes to arbitration, is not clear. The shipment of\n> fuel to this city is seriously embarrassed, as is the movement of every\n> other commodity for that matter. There is, it is said, scarcely a ton of\n> soft coal in the city, although 50,000 tons are burned daily.\n>\n> There is, however, a great amount of hard coal scattered through the various\n> yards, but this is ruinously expensive means of making steam. Every railroad\n> entering Chicago is seriously crippled. Many of the trunk lines are\n> paralyzed. Traffic has been suspended on some of the lines. The suburban\n> service of the Illinois Central is practically at a standstill.\n>\n> AN ATTEMPT TO STOP TRAINS\n>\n> At 6 o'clock tonight an attempt will be made to stop all trains on the Lake\n> street road. This line does not handle Pullman cars, but Mr. Debs has called\n> the fireman out, but the company is using non-union coal for fuel, hauled by\n> the Panhandle road. Troops are being moved to clear the blockade in\n> California and Colorado, but there is a prospect that they will be stopped\n> in transit by engineers who are in sympathy with the strikers. An attempt to\n> move troops from Springfield, Illinois, to Decatur has created a small riot.\n>\n> GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE IN SESSION\n>\n> The Grievance Committee of the employes of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St.\n> Paul Railroad was in session last evening and were visited by a large number\n> of men, employes of the road. \"There is no strike on the Milwaukee road,\"\n> said Chairman Durban, \"nor will there be one, until it is ordered by this\n> Committee.\n>\n> \u201cA year ago, we had strikes all to ourselves and gained what we demanded.\n> Since then we have maintained our road Federation, composed of the Lodges of\n> the regular organizations. We think we are fully able to attend to our part\n> of the business.\"\n>\n> MARINE ENGINEERS JOIN HANDS.\n>\n> Land and water are to join hands in the strike. A deputation of marine\n> engineers visited Ulrich's Hall last night and stated that the local Union\n> here had resolved not to handle a pound of freight hauled by any one of the\n> boycotted roads. He said he had been authorized to give this information by\n> Thomas F. Dowd, President of the local Union.\n>\n> This is the first offer to pour the Lakes into the controversy, and the\n> Union will consider the matter today and avail themselves of it to suspend\n> freight business and involve shipping on the Lakes.\n>\n> The marine engineers are examined and licensed men, and if they go out their\n> places cannot be supplied. The Railway Union is much elated over their\n> accession.\n>\n> NO LIVESTOCK ARRIVES\n>\n> Today for the the time in the history of the livestock trade in Chicago not\n> a single carload of animals reached the Union Stock Yards by rail.\n> Absolutely the only livestock received was a bunch of thirteen hogs that\n> came in a wagon.\n>\n> Thousands of packing house employes and other workmen of the packing town\n> were made idle. The Michigan Central tried to make up and start a trainload\n> of dressed beef last night. The trainmen abandoned the cars with short\n> notice, and the beef was left to rot on the tracks.\n>\n> THE BOYCOTT SPREADING\n>\n> The Pullman boycott is gradually spreading. The Burlington, which employs\n> non-Union men, is about the only Chicago road not affected. The Chicago and\n> Northwestern, which up to last night had escaped, is completely tied up\n> today. Its suburban traffic is very heavy, and great inconvenience results\n> from the stopping of this branch of business.\n>\n> The Illinois Central, Erie, Milwaukee and St. Paul and Great Western all\n> report a like condition. A general tie-up at Detroit today stops the\n> Michigan Southern and Michigan Central effectually. The Western Indiana\n> Terminal, over which the Grand Trunk, Chicago and Erie, Wabash, Eastern\n> Illinois, Santa Fe and Monon roads enter the city was handling passenger\n> trains with a reasonable degree of efficiency up to last night. Today all\n> these roads are again in trouble.\n>\n> A NEW DIFFICULTY.\n>\n> A new difficulty is presented by the refusal of the engineers and firemen to\n> risk their lives by working with green hands, and the railway managers\n> themselves are not anxious for fighting.\n>\n> They are exceedingly fearful of precipitating battle on the Fourth of July,\n> and they will make no serious efforts to move trains before Thursday\n> morning. They also say that the suspension of business at this time is not\n> an unmixed evil. \"We know perfectly well that the freight is in the country\n> and must move sooner or later,\" said one today, \"and we shall ultimately get\n> ,our share. It will not be long before the inconvenience, resulting from the\n> suspension, will be keenly felt everywhere, and then we believe that public\n> sentiment will be a great factor in the extinction of Debs and his people.\"\n>\n> The prices of provisions are advancing very rapidly; fruits, ice and all\n> kinds of perishable property are commanding high prices.\n\n(there\u2019s more. Much more.)\n\n###\n\nDebs, Pullman, Cleveland, and Olney\n\n(\u201cCleveland\u201d was Grover Cleveland, the President.)\n\nYou\u2019ve seen the newspaper articles bemoaning the failure of other means of\ncombating the strike, and calling for Federal troops. This was a momentous\nstep, and according to some reasoning, e.g. the Posse Comitatus Act, it wasn\u2019t\neven legal, so Cleveland hesitated. But Attorney General Olney, who was a\nrailroad lawyer,\n\nwas insistent. His arguments centered around the issue of the US Mail cars\nbeing interfered with, and the boycott\u2019s effect on \u201cinterstate commerce.\u201d He\nwon the day, and troops were called out.\n\nDebs, on the other hand, was in what we\u2019d have to call a state of denial. He\u2019d\noverestimated his own strength, and he just didn\u2019t realize how intransigent\nand ruthless his opponents were. He thought that the inevitable solution had\nto be an impartial panel to arbitrate the dispute, like he\u2019d successfully\nobtained in Minnesota. Surely Pullman would agree to that, right? Debs was\ndefiant.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the Washington Post for July 5, which was certainly expecting a\nnegotiated settlement while they reported on the troops\u2019 first engagements\nwith the mobs.\n\n> TALK OF CIVIL WAR\n>\n> Soldiers' First Shot Will Produce a Revolution.\n>\n> SO SAYS PRESIDENT DEBS`\n>\n> Chicago Adds Train-Raiding to its Fourth of July Fun.\n>\n> CHARGING BAYONETS ON THE MOB\n>\n> It Is Claimed by the A. R. U. that the Railway Managers Have Misled the\n> Government and Wrongfully Caused the Calling Out of Troops--Probability of a\n> Settlement This Week \u2014 Mr. Debs Cares Nothing for Battalions. Injunctions,\n> or Indictments\u2014A Conference to Be Held Today \u2014 Intense Excitement Prevailed\n> All Yesterday\u2014Futile Attempts to Move Trains, and Frequent Collisions\n> Between the Soldiers and Strikers, but No Tragedies or Deaths Are Yet\n> Reported.\n>\n> Chicago, July 4.\u2014\"The first shot fired by the regular soldiers at the mobs\n> here will be the signal for a civil war. I believe this as firmly as I\n> believe in the ultimate success of our course. Bloodshed will follow, and 90\n> per cent of the people of the United States will be arrayed against the\n> other 10 per cent. And I would not care to be arrayed against the laboring\n> people in the contest, or find myself out of the ranks of labor when the\n> struggle ended. I do not say this as an alarmist, but calmly and\n> thoughtfully.\"\n>\n> Such were the remarks made by President Eugene V. Debs, of the American\n> Railway Union, to a United Press reporter this afternoon. Mr. Deb had just\n> received news of the trouble at the stock yards and the arrests at Blue\n> Island. He severely condemned the course pursued by the railway managers in\n> misleading the government officials and causing them to order out the\n> regulars to protect trains and overawe the strikers and their sympathizers.\n\nHe goes on to predict a general revolution. Pullman, on the other hand, made\nan effort to appear sanguine. He wasn\u2019t even in Chicago; he was \u201crelaxing\u201d in\nhis New Jersey beach retreat.\n\n\u201cOrder out the regulars to protect trains and overawe the strikers and their\nsympathizers.\u201d is exactly what they did. Besides \u201cthe regulars,\u201d Gov. Altgeld\n(much more on him later) called out the state militia.\n\n###\n\nRioting Spreads\n\nHere\u2019s the New York Times for Saturday, July 7:\n\n> STRIKERS APPLY THE TORCH\n>\n> HUNDREDS OF CARS BURNED IN CHICAGO'S VICINITY.\n>\n> PULLMAN AND KENSINGTON TERRORIZED\n>\n> Mob of Rioters Fled at the First Approach of Illinois State Soldiers.\n>\n> TWO OF THE STRIKERS SHOT.\n>\n> Work of Incendiarism Was First Begun is the Stock Yards, Where Scores of\n> Fires Attested the Lawlessness of the Mob -- The large Crowd then went West\n> to Kensington and Pullman, Where Engines Were Derailed, Switches Destroyed,\n> and Hundreds of Cars Set on Fire\u2014State Militia Ordered Out by Got. Altgeld\n> at the Request of Mayor Hopkins-Pullman Guarded to Resist a Midnight\n> Attack\u2014Chicago Citizens Feel Alarmed.\n>\n> CHICAGO. July 4.--The town of Pullman is guarded tonight by a company of the\n> State militia, in anticipation of an attack by the mob. The sky is lighted\n> up with the glare of the flames from 2,000 or more freight can that are\n> burning in the Eldson yards on the Grand Trunk Road. A hundred police have\n> gone to the scene with orders to shoot on sight if they are attacked. The\n> loss to the Grand Trunk will be enormous. A mob began work on the Burlington\n> shortly before midnight, burning many car in the yards at Hawthorne. It is\n> thought that several thousand freight cars have been destroyed on the\n> different roads during the day and up to midnight. For the first time since\n> the American Railway Union declared the strike in actual operation a feeling\n> of fear and alarm permeates the entire community.\n>\n> In business circles it was the one absorbing topic during the day to the\n> exclusion of everything else, while tonight in the residence districts the\n> extras of the evening papers command a premium, and the telephones are\n> besieged with anxious inquirers. It is just such a condition of semi-\n> suppressed alarm and anxiety as Paris experienced in the hours that\n> immediately preceded the initiative demonstration of the commune.\n>\n> The railroads toward which the animosity of the mob has been mainly directed\n> played a waiting game during the day. The experiences of yesterday had made\n> it certain that no attempt to raise the embargo at the stock yards could be\n> successful without the aid of additional troops, and, as the regulars\n> ordered from Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and Fort Brady, Mich., were delayed\n> until the day was well under way, it was agreed that discretion would be the\n> better pan of valor, and that the stockyards people could better afford to\n> wait a while than to give additional ammunition to the strikers in the shape\n> of a repetition of yesterday's fiasco.\n>\n> The mob, however, regarded this determination more as a confession of\n> weakness than as a stroke of policy, and, accordingly, it set out to follow\n> up its supposed advantage.\n>\n> In the stock yards region cars were overturned and at some points fired and\n> switches rendered useless, while half a dozen fires in the immediate region\n> of the yards, all of evident incendiary origin, and some of which might have\n> destroyed property representing millions of dollars but for the prompt\n> service of the local Firs Department, testified to the determination of the\n> lawless element to stop at nothing in its career of riot and destruction. It\n> demonstrated, moreover, that there was method, not to say diplomacy, in its\n> madness, by changing its base of operation to Kensington, a point several\n> miles distant, involving other roads than those of the stockyards district,\n> and a region where an outbreak had least been expected.\n>\n> Here, almost under the shadow of the gates of Pullman City, it held high\n> carnival, capturing trains, derailing cars, and subjecting the crews and\n> escorting Deputy Marshals to showers of coupling pins. stones, and other\n> missiles.\n>\n> A special officer who was compelled to shoot in self-defense hit two of the\n> mob and temporarily scared their associates, but later the situation became\n> so threatening that on the request of United States Marshal Arnold a company\n> of regulars was dispatched to the scene upon orders from Gen. Miles. Acting\n> upon the old adage of \"Better Late than Never \" Mayor Hopkins this morning\n> made a requisition upon Gov. Altgeld for the aid of the State militia, and\n> it was quickly complied with.\n>\n> (much more)\n\n###\n\nAltgeld and Cleveland Spar\n\nGovernor Peter Altgeld of Illinois was strongly opposed to US troops being\nused in his state, and told the President so. President Cleveland was\nunyielding:\n\n> The Hon. John P. Altgeld, Governor of Illinois, Springfield, Ill. '\n>\n> While I am still persuaded that I have neither transcended my authority or\n> duty in the emergency that confronts us, it seems to me that in this hour of\n> danger and public distress, discussion may well give way to active effort on\n> the part of all in authority to restore obedience to law and to protect life\n> and property.\n>\n> GROVER CLEVELAND.\n\nTranslation: \u201cThe time for talk is over. Get on the team.\u201d\n\nAltgeld\u2019s long response was also printed on the front page of the Times. He\ncited local authority and denied the President\u2019s power to send in troops\nwhenever he felt like it.\n\n###\n\nGeneral Strike?\n\nThe ultimate weapon for labor is \u201ceveryone goes on strike.\u201d Not just one\ncompany or one industry: everyone. Debs thought this was the time for it, and\nif that a socialist revolution, so be it.\n\nHere\u2019s the Chicago Tribune for Saturday, July 7, reporting on a union meeting\nthe day before:\n\n> TO TIE UP INDUSTRY.\n>\n> BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL WILL JOIN THE STRIKE.\n>\n> At a Meeting in Which All the Federated Orders Have Representation, It Is\n> De-cided to Suspend Work Until the Demand for Arbitration Is Heeded\u2014Effort\n> Will Be Made to Secure the Cooperation of All Labor Organizations In a\n> Cessation of Activity.\n>\n> There was little friction in the session of the Building Trades Council last\n> night. It was practically unanimous in favor of a strike. All the varied\n> interests were represented. The session was prolonged until nearly 2 o\u2019clock\n> this morning. One faction desired a more emphatic expression than was\n> contained in the minutes of the session given herewith. The more\n> conservative element prevailed, and these declarations were agree upon:\n>\n> The Building and Trades Council of the City Chicago, representing 25.000\n> organized workingmen in the Building Trades Council, in regular meeting\n> assembled Friday evening, July 6, 1894. passed the following resolutions:\n>\n> WHEREAS, The present conditions existing between the railroad employ\u00e9s and\n> the employers is such as calls for the earnest consideration of all classes\n> of organized labor; and\n>\n> WHEREAS, It is apparent that capital is organized in conjunction with the\n> said railroad corporations and the Pullman company, backed by the State and\n> Federal militia, to defeat the just demands for arbitration ; therefore be\n> it\n>\n> Resolved, That this Building Trades Council declares in favor of a general\n> cessation of all industries throughout the country, provided such demand for\n> arbitration is not conceded. We, therefore, call on all organized labor\n> throughout the country to immediately consider the advisability of such a\n> step; and be it further |\n>\n> Resolved, That this Building Trades Council calls upon the American\n> Federation of Labor and all executive officers of all national and\n> international labor organizations to take steps to centralize and strengthen\n> such a movement to go into effect as soon as possible.\n\n###\n\nTesting the Troops\u2019 Seriousness\n\nTaunting police officers and troops is a dangerous game. \u201cThey won\u2019t dare\nshoot us!\u201d some rioters probably thought. Saturday, July 7 was the day when\nthe answer came: we\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\n\nHere\u2019s the Tribune for Sunday, July 8:\n\n> DAY OF BLOOD\n>\n> Soldiers Shoot Down Rioters in Many Railroad Yards.\n>\n> ALL FORCES ENGAGED.\n>\n> Company C, Second Regiment, Chastises the Mob.\n>\n> FOUR DEAD, MANY WOUNDED\n>\n> Fatal Fight at Loomis and Forty-ninth Streets.\n>\n> (A long list of the names of those killed and wounded)\n\nViolence wasn\u2019t limited to Chicago. Hammond, Indiana, just across the state\nline from Chicago, also saw troops firing at rioters. The Tribune for Monday\nJuly 8:\n\n> BLOOD AT HAMMOND.\n>\n> BULLET IN ONE MAN\u2019S HEART\n>\n> THREE PEOPLE WOUNDED.\n>\n> Strikers Try to Get Troops Into a Trap and Uncle Sam's Men Shoot to Kill\n>\n> Sixteen Companies of Indiana Militia Rushing to the Scene\n>\n> Illinois State Soldiers Will Cooperate\n>\n> Protests from Hammond Citizens\n>\n> Attempt Made to Burn a Railroad Bridge.\n>\n> Ten days ago the strikers at Hammond, Ind., promised to allow trains to pass\n> through their town without molestation. and in consideration of this pledge\n> State troops ordered there by Gov.

Maybe de-escalate the situation, call for dialog,\nget George Pullman on the line and say, \u201cOK, Georgie Boy, this tough-guy stuff\nhas gone on long enough. You\u2019re meeting me here to talk with Debs in my\noffice.\u201d He\u2019s the President. He can summon people and they come.\n\nThis is what Teddy Roosevelt would have done. He expanded the role of the\nPresidency, but he didn\u2019t occupy that office yet.\n\nNot Cleveland. He issued this on Sunday night:\n\n> PROCLAMATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF. THE UNITED STATES.\n>\n> Whereas, By reason of unlawful obstructions, combination, and assemblages of\n> persons, it has become impracticable, in the judgment of the President, to\n> Enforce, by the ordinary course of Judicial proceedings, the law of the\n> United States within the State of Illinois, and especially in the City of\n> Chicago, within said State; and\n>\n> Whereas, For the purpose of Enforcing the faithful execution of the laws of\n> the United States and protecting its property and removing obstructions to\n> the United States mails in the State and city aforesaid, the President has\n> employed a part of the military forces of the United States:\n>\n> Now, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do\n> hereby admonish all good citizens and all persons who may be or may come\n> within the city and State aforesaid, against aiding, countenancing,\n> encouraging, or taking any part in such unlawful obstructions, combinations,\n> and assemblages, and I hereby warn all persons engaged in, or in any way\n> connected with, such unlawful obstructions, combinations, and assemblages to\n> disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes on or before 12\n> o'clock noon on the 9th day of July int.\n>\n> Those who disregard this warning and persist in taking part with a riotous\n> mob in forcibly resisting and obstructing the execution of the laws of the\n> United States, or interfering with the functions of the Government, or\n> destroying or attempting to destroy the property belonging to the United\n> States or under its protection, cannot be regarded otherwise than as public\n> enemies.

It has been declared in\nthe United States numerous times, first by General Andrew Jackson in New\nOrleans in the War of 1812. The Brennan Center lists the many times that\nmartial law has been used in the US.\n\nEssentially, during martial law the military is in control, and Constitutional\nrights, particularly habeas corpus, are suspended. Abraham Lincoln used it\nduring the Civil War, and FDR used it in Hawaii after Pearl Harbor.\n\nCleveland was a lawyer who knew very well what martial law was, and he was\ncareful to say that the purpose of the troops was to enforce the laws, not\nreplace them.\n\nWhile the Posse Comitatus Act did prohibit employing US military for domestic\nlaw enforcement, there was an exception, the Insurrection Act, which read:\n\n> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\n> States of America in Congress assembled, That in all cases of insurrection,\n> or obstruction to the laws, either of the United States, or of any\n> individual state or territory, where it is lawful for the President of the\n> United States to call forth the militia for the purpose of suppressing such\n> insurrection, or of causing the laws to be duly executed, it shall be lawful\n> for him to employ, for the same purposes, such part of the land or naval\n> force of the United States, as shall be judged necessary, having first\n> observed all the pre-requisites of the law in that respect.\n\nWhile Cleveland didn\u2019t explicitly invoke that act, his language is certainly\nreminiscent.\n\n###\n\nA New Week Begins\n\nMonday morning, July 9. The week began with Cleveland and Debs both defiant.\n\nUnion leaders in Chicago had called for a general strike on Wednesday, July\n11. The Knights of Labor had called their men out. But what would Samuel\nGompers, head of the American Federation of Labor do? He refused to say, and\ncalled a meeting of the AFL\u2019s officers for Thursday. Debs was left hanging and\nfacing arrest.\n\n####\n\nScabs\n\nAll strikes in this era revolved around whether management could hire\nreplacement workers, often called \u201cscabs.\u201d Frequently the replacements were\nset upon by the strikers, management\u2019s hired thugs tried to protect them, and\nviolence ensued.\n\nUnfortunately, this being a general Depression, there were plenty of desperate\nworkers willing to risk it and take those jobs. The railroads all over the\ncountry were slowly getting their trains running again.\n\nNext week: the strike fails and Debs goes to jail.\n\n### Subscribe to Life Since the Baby Boom\n\nBy Albert Cory \u00b7 Launched 2 years ago\n\nAmusing stuff from a Boomer Fl\u00e2neur in high tech\n\n1 Like\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Anarchy in the US, Part 3\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nNo Source Code == No Patent\n\nHow we know you \"have' the invention\n\nApr 17, 2023 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n4\n\nShare this post\n\n#### No Source Code == No Patent\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n10\n\nBring Back Private Offices\n\nOpen Office Sucks\n\nMar 4 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n19\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Bring Back Private Offices\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n14\n\nWorking at Google: Maps\n\n\"Oh, I Love Google Maps!\"\n\nFeb 13, 2023 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n5\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Working at Google: Maps\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n3\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Albert Cory\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
