Settling on her couch after a difficult\nstretch at work, a woman named Joan (Annie Murphy) logs on to Streamberry, a\nbarely veiled stand-in for Netflix, and stumbles upon a TV show based on the\nevents of her day: \u201cJoan Is Awful,\u201d starring Salma Hayek. The program proceeds\nto ruin her life, but it\u2019s nothing personal; Streamberry, which runs on\ncutting-edge algorithms, made \u201cJoan Is Awful\u201d with no human input. Not a\nsingle writer or actor is involved in the production: the scripts are churned\nout by artificial intelligence, and the performances are elaborate deepfakes.\nThe \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d episode, which d\u00e9buted in the midst of the ongoing Writers\nGuild of America strike, struck an immediate chord\u2014unsurprisingly so, given\nthat concerns about A.I. have become a flash point in the union\u2019s negotiations\nwith the studios. One member of the Screen Actors Guild, which has joined the\nwriters on the picket line, called the episode \u201ca documentary of the future.\u201d\nBut Joan\u2019s travails left me wondering whether Streamberry was too rosy a\nportrait of where Hollywood is headed. Even in this bleakly automated vision\nof entertainment as Hell, there\u2019s still some semblance of risk and innovation.\n\nTo survey the film and television industry today is to witness multiple\nexistential crises. Many of them point to a larger trend: of Hollywood\ndivesting from its own future, making dodgy decisions in the short term that\nwhittle down its chances of long-term survival. Corporations are no strangers\nto fiscal myopia, but the ways in which the studios are currently squeezing\nout profits\u2014nickel-and-diming much of their labor force to the edge of\nfinancial precarity while branding their output with the hallmarks of creative\nbankruptcy\u2014indicate a shocking new carelessness. Signs of this slow suicide\nare all around: the narrowing pipelines for rising talent, the overreliance on\nnostalgia projects, and a general negligence in cultivating enthusiasm for its\nproducts. Writers and actors have walked out to demand fairer wages and a more\nequitable system, but they\u2019ve also argued, quite persuasively, that they\u2019re\nthe ones trying to insure the industry\u2019s sustainability. Meanwhile, studio\nexecutives\u2014themselves subject to C-suite musical chairs\u2014seem disinterested in\nsteering Hollywood away from the iceberg. This is perhaps because the\nlandscape is shifting (and facets of it are shrinking) so rapidly that they\nthemselves have little idea of what the future of Hollywood might look like.\n\nThe apocalyptic vibes are of fairly recent vintage. The 2007-08 W.G.A. strike,\nfor example, didn\u2019t, and couldn\u2019t, anticipate the ways in which the Internet,\nand then the tech giants, would upend the television industry. Even back then,\nthe writers took issue with the compensation structure for Web-hosted content,\nbut the union was mostly bargaining with companies that were firmly rooted in\nHollywood and its traditions. The streaming wars, of which writers and actors\nrightly see themselves as collateral damage, have introduced players like\nApple and Amazon, for whom content is only a tiny portion of their broader\nbusiness strategies\u2014a value-add for iPhone users or Prime subscribers.\nTogether with Netflix, the move-fast, break-things, maybe-fix-later crowd has\nbrought with it the Silicon Valley playbook of burning up investor or reserve\ncash now in the hopes of profit tomorrow, and in the process has forced some\nof Hollywood\u2019s most storied studios, most notably Disney and Warner Bros.,\ninto billions in debt to stay competitive.\n\nSome of the first Cassandras to draw the public\u2019s attention to this slo-mo\nself-sabotage were the striking writers. W.G.A. members have expressed alarm\nnot only that their profession has become devalued and unstable through low\npay but also that the paths that allowed newcomers to eventually become\nshowrunners, which have existed for the past half century, have been eroded by\nthe studios. On the podcast \u201cThe Town,\u201d Mike Schur, the creator of \u201cThe Good\nPlace\u201d and the co-creator of \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine,\u201d\nidentified some of the skills beyond writing scripts\u2014such as editing, sound\nmixing, and color correction\u2014that he learned about from his mentor Greg\nDaniels on his first episodic writing job, on \u201cThe Office.\u201d Schur\u2019s\napprenticeship took place not just in the writers\u2019 room but on set\u2014a location\nfrom which TV writers are increasingly being shut out. Schur notes that\napproximately eleven members of the \u201cThe Office\u201d \u2019s writing staff went on to\nbecome first-time showrunners, including Mindy Kaling and B. J. Novak, in an\nexample of the system working as it should. Today\u2019s mini rooms make it so that\nfewer writers are hired and that their stint on a show is often over by the\ntime the cameras start rolling, rendering it more challenging for neophytes to\nbuild the kind of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that enables them to advance in the industry. The\ndismantling of this ladder is all the more counterintuitive given that the\nscarcity of experienced showrunners during the content boom has been a known\nproblem for years.\n\nThe movies may be in grimmer shape. The industry\u2019s pursuit of I.P. at the\nexpense of originality has all but trained younger audiences not to expect\nnovelty or surprise at the multiplex, assuming that they\u2019re going to the\ntheatre at all. Hollywood has never been known for overestimating the\naudience\u2019s intelligence, but it\u2019s hard not to wonder how it is supposed to be\ninculcating a love of cinema in children\u2014that is, future moviegoers\u2014when the\nsplashiest films on offer are explicitly buckets of regurgitation. Early\nsummer gave us the live-action \u201cLittle Mermaid,\u201d the latest in Disney\u2019s\ncannibalization of its archives. The animated film was one of the first movies\nthat I remember seeing, and it really did feel magical. Even then, Ariel\u2019s\ncoming of age was criticized in some circles for making its heroine a boy-\ncrazy shopaholic, but the fact that millennials continue to lovingly mock it\nyears later attests to its endurance as a classic. The 1989 film swelled with\npassion and longing, transported us to unseen worlds, and left us with\nindelible characters and glorious earworms. It convinced girls that it was\nO.K. to want more (even if it was more thingamabobs). There\u2019s a measure of\nprogress, to be sure, in recasting Ariel as a Black mermaid played by Halle\nBailey, but the mixed reviews all but confirm that it\u2019s a dead-eyed knockoff\nof the original. It\u2019s true that early impressions can forge a childhood\nattachment to almost anything, but the way that kids grow to love movies as\nadults is by offering them, well, great films and relevant themes, instead of\na parade of listless remakes with stories that were meant to speak to a\ngeneration three decades ago.\n\nPerhaps we should have seen the breakdown of the star-making machine as a\npreview of things to come. Screen celebrity is nearly as old as the movie\nindustry itself, but the device seems to have stopped minting household names\nsome time in the past twenty years. The movie stars of yesteryear are still\nthe movie stars of today. A study by the National Research Group, a market-\nresearch firm that specializes in entertainment, life style, and technology,\nfound that, of the twenty actors most likely to pull audiences to a theatre,\nonly one was under the age of forty (Chris Hemsworth), and the average age of\nthat group was fifty-eight. (The sexagenarian Tom Cruise topped the list.) In\nlieu of finding and launching the next Denzel Washington or Julia Roberts,\nstudios have poured millions into digitally de-aging graying A-listers.\nHollywood stardom is becoming something unthinkable at any other era of its\nexistence: a gerontocracy.\n\nI.P. is again to blame. Franchises killed the movie star. Spider-Man can be\nplayed by Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland, Batman by Michael\nKeaton or Christian Bale or Ben Affleck or Robert Pattinson or Michael Keaton\nagain. An industry famous for worshipping youth is more clueless than ever\nabout what to do with its young people. (What\u2019s \u201ca Tom Holland movie\u201d? Who can\nsay?) And, for those emerging actors who used to see background work as an\nentry point to a notoriously gate-kept industry, it turns out the studios\nmight prefer to digitally scan their likeness instead, possibly locking them\nout of opportunities for more days on set.\n\nAfter \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d broke box-office records, sequels may have been seen\nas the key to luring audiences back to theatres, which have been languishing\nsince the pandemic. But this summer\u2019s long-in-the-tooth franchises\u2014\u201cMission:\nImpossible,\u201d \u201cTransformers,\u201d \u201cIndiana Jones,\u201d and \u201cThe Fast and the\nFurious\u201d\u2014have performed just satisfactorily, if not disappointingly. \u201cBarbie,\u201d\nmeanwhile, saw the director Greta Gerwig infuse the half-century-old blond\nblank slate with her own idiosyncratic anxieties to produce a Zeitgeist-\ncapturing film with an unmistakable authorial imprimatur. But Hollywood\u2019s\nignoring the obvious takeaway, which is that viewers appreciate novelty.\nInstead, Mattel has announced that it will follow up \u201cBarbie\u201d by raiding its\ntoy closet for more I.P., and has put dozens of projects based on its products\ninto development.\n\nTrends in television are no less dispiriting, with networks soliciting \u201cvisual\nMuzak,\u201d as some in the industry have put it. The TV writer Lila Byock told my\ncolleague Michael Schulman this spring that the streamers are most eager for\n\u201csecond-screen content\u201d: shows to have on in the background while the viewer\npresumably scrolls through their phone. In a recent interview, the actor and\ndirector Justine Bateman said that network notes now request that shows be\nless engaging so that distracted audiences won\u2019t lose track of the plot and\nturn them off.\n\nEven the strike\u2019s prolongation suggests an inane shortsightedness. Film and\ntelevision are already losing the competition for eyeballs to video games and\nthe Internet. The Bloomberg journalist Lucas Shaw has reported that \u201cpeople\nspend more time (and money) on video games than they do on movies, and they\nspend more time watching YouTube than any other TV network.\u201d The lack of new\nscripted programming on the broadcast networks as a result of the strikes is\nforecast to hasten their coming obsolescence. The momentum from the successes\nof \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in bringing audiences back to theatres has been\nsquandered by the pushing back of many of this year\u2019s releases to 2024. But,\nthe longer the studios stretch out the strike, the more likely it is that\nconsumers will form new leisure habits on TikTok or Animal Crossing.\n\nThe disruption that Netflix and the streaming wars have unleashed on the\nentertainment industry in just the past decade has been so unpredictable that\nit seems foolish to predict only doom, although that\u2019s certainly where the\narrows are pointing. But even Hollywood\u2019s boosters have to admit that, since\nthe streaming era, movies and television feel less special, labor conditions\n(for writers, actors, and below-the-line crew members) have plummeted, and the\nindustry\u2019s turbulent mergers and layoffs call into question which legendary\ninstitutions will still stand in another ten or twenty years. I won\u2019t purport\nto know how to fix Hollywood, but the answer doesn\u2019t seem to lie in\nhighlighting the industry\u2019s creative torpor and timidity while driving away\nthe people with the institutional knowledge to transform an idea into hours of\nspectacle, comfort, provocation, or maybe even art made by hundreds or\nthousands of people. Perhaps Hollywood isn\u2019t willing to bet on its future, but\nit can at least stop from actively working against it. \u2666\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Searching for the cause of a catastrophic plane crash.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * Gloria Steinem\u2019s life on the feminist frontier.\n\n  * Where the Amish go on vacation.\n\n  * How Colonel Sanders built his Kentucky-fried fortune.\n\n  * What does procrastination tell us about ourselves?\n\n  * Fiction by Patricia Highsmith: \u201cThe Trouble with Mrs. Blynn, the Trouble with the World\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nInkoo Kang is a television critic at The New Yorker.\n\nMore:HollywoodTelevisionFilmsLabor StrikesStreaming PlatformsNetflix\n\n### Goings On\n\nWhat we\u2019re watching, listening to, and doing this week, online, in N.Y.C., and\nbeyond.
