(AP) \u2014 Astronomers have discovered a rare in-sync solar\nsystem with six planets moving like a grand cosmic orchestra, untouched by\noutside forces since their birth billions of years ago.\n\nThe find, announced Wednesday, can help explain how solar systems across the\nMilky Way galaxy came to be. This one is 100 light-years away in the\nconstellation Coma Berenices. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.\n\nWATCH: TESS, NASA\u2019s new exoplanet hunter, launches on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket\n\nA pair of planet-hunting satellites \u2014 NASA\u2019s TESS and the European Space\nAgency\u2019s CHEOPS\u2014 teamed up for the observations.\n\nNone of the planets in perfect synchrony are within the star\u2019s so-called\nhabitable zone, which means little if any likelihood of life, at least as we\nknow it.\n\n\u201cHere we have a golden target\u201d for comparison, said Adrien Leleu of the\nUniversity of Geneva, who was part of an international team that published the\nresults in the journal Nature.\n\nThis star, known as HD 110067, may have even more planets. The six found so\nfar are roughly two to three times the size of Earth, but with densities\ncloser to the gas giants in our own solar system. Their orbits range from nine\nto 54 days, putting them closer to their star than Venus is to the sun and\nmaking them exceedingly hot.\n\nAs gas planets, they\u2019re believed to have solid cores made of rock, metal or\nice, enveloped by thick layers of hydrogen, according to the scientists. More\nobservations are needed to determine what\u2019s in their atmospheres.\n\nThis solar system is unique because all six planets move similar to a\nperfectly synchronized symphony, scientists said. In technical terms, it\u2019s\nknown as resonance that\u2019s \u201cprecise, very orderly,\u201d said co-author Enric Palle\nof the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands.\n\nThe innermost planet completes three orbits for every two by its closest\nneighbor. It\u2019s the same for the second- and third-closest planets, and the\nthird- and fourth-closest planets.\n\nThe two outermost planets complete an orbit in 41 and 54.7 days, resulting in\nfour orbits for every three. The innermost planet, meanwhile, completes six\norbits in exactly the time the outermost completes one.\n\nAll solar systems, including our own, are thought to have started out like\nthis one, according to the scientists. But it\u2019s estimated only 1-in-100\nsystems have retained that synchrony, and ours isn\u2019t one of them. Giant\nplanets can throw things off-kilter. So can meteor bombardments, close\nencounters with neighboring stars and other disturbances.\n\nWhile astronomers know of 40 to 50 in-sync solar systems, none have as many\nplanets in such perfect step or as bright a star as this one, Palle said.\n\nREAD MORE: Explosions end 2nd test flight of SpaceX\u2019s new mega rocket\n\nThe University of Bern\u2019s Hugh Osborn, who was part of the team, was \u201cshocked\nand delighted\u201d when the orbital periods of this star system\u2019s planets came\nclose to what scientists predicted.\n\n\u201cMy jaw was on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was a really nice moment.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.
