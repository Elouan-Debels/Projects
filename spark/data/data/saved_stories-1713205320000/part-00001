In Germany, Munich and Lower\nSaxony both decided to switch to open source for official IT. Both projects,\nto some extent or another*, returned to Microsoft. Now the state of Schleswig-\nHolstein is hoping for third time lucky. It's been planning the same thing for\nthree years, and now it's pressing the button.\n\nThere are good reasons to think that this time open source may stick. The\nlessons of the last two failed transitions, nominally costs too high and\ncompatibility too low, have been taken on board. The plan is to start with\nLibreOffice and move through essential infrastructure and desktop OS to the\nfull top-to-bottom open stack. Open source in 2024 is simply better than it\nwas last decade. Microsoft's focus on moving people to Office 365 and upping\nhardware specs for Windows 11 for no good reason makes taking a different path\nmuch more palatable.\n\nThese are good reasons that make the transition plausible, desirable, and\ndoable. They have little to do with its success.\n\nSchleswig-Holstein says the major drivers this time are data protection,\nprivacy, and security. The argument is that it's irresponsible to hand all\nthose to an outside agency, let alone one without state oversight, albeit\nsubject to the Digital Services and Digital Markets Act. The state must\nprotect its people. Today, that means their data. The term is Digital\nSovereignty. If you think that sounds like a political decision, boy are you\never right.\n\nSovereignty is a game played for the highest stakes. An expensive synonym for\nindependence, it's frequently used to mask the many nuances of living in an\ninterconnected world \u2013 ask any sane Brit about Brexit \u2013 but here it\ncrystallized the reality of our data-driven lives: most countries are client\nstates of the Microsoft empire.\n\nWe should note here that Microsoft also has cloud products that it says\nprovide sovereign data for customers. And it has complied with several rulings\non data protection and privacy both by Germany specifically and by the\nEuropean union more generally.\n\nClient states go back as far as history. An empire uses its heft to compel a\nclient state to a contract that sets out what the client has to do for its\noverlords, what the overlords will do for the client, and what happens if the\nclient disobeys. These three things boil down to the client sending lots of\nresources in exchange for trusting the empire to defend it. If the client\nrevolts, game over. If the empire changes its mind, that's too bad.\n\nThese agreements are called suzerain-vassal treaties. They go back as far as\nAncient Egypt through to the Warsaw Pact, and further if Vladimir Putin wins\nin Ukraine. You'll have one at home if you have a copy of the Old Testament\nbecause that's what the Book of Deuteronomy is, and one in the office if\nyou've got a contract with Big Tech. Well, almost.\n\nThe flaw in such treaties for clients is that they have no option but to trust\nan entity they may not find trustworthy. In most of the modern world, this is\nno longer entirely true because of national and international law and\nregulation. The downside for the overlords is that if one client successfully\nrevolts, the gig is up. Others will swiftly follow. That remains entirely\ntrue, and both Microsoft and Schleswig-Holstein know this in their bones.\n\nMicrosoft will want to prevent this transition from happening. It has infinite\nresources for lobbying, legal action, and whatever other actions it thinks it\nneeds. In the past, its privacy stance saw it banned for use in schools in the\nstate of Hessen, although the company has absorbed rectifying decisions that\neventually followed. This too is fully understood, and very much not\nappreciated, in Germany.\n\n  * Tele2 secure collaboration hub for public sector keeps Swedish data in Sweden\n  * French cloud Scaleway starts renting Alibaba's RISC-V SoC\n  * Fedora Project mulls 'privacy preserving' usage telemetry\n  * Munich mk2? Germany's Schleswig-Holstein plans to switch 25,000 PCs to LibreOffice\n\nMicrosoft has a lot of cards to play here. Schleswig-Holstein will have to\nmaintain compatibility with Windows within its own borders, with the German\nfederation, with Europe, and the rest of the world. If a change to Windows\nhappens to break that compatibility, guess who picks up the pain and the\nbills. Microsoft wouldn't dream of doing that deliberately, no matter how high\nthe stakes, yet these things happen. Freedom to innovate, don't you know.\n\n## German state ditches Windows, Microsoft Office for Linux and LibreOffice\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIf in five years the transition is a success, the benefits to the state, the\npeople, and open source will be immeasurable. As well as bringing data\nprotection back to those charged with providing it, it will give European laws\nnew teeth. It will increase expertise, funding, and opportunities for open\nsource. Schleswig-Holstein itself will become a new hub of technical\nexcellence in an area that intensely interests the rest of the world, in\npublic and private organizations.\n\nMicrosoft cannot afford to let this happen. Schleswig-Holstein cannot back\ndown, now it's made it a battle for independence. That may change if a new set\nof politicians are elected with a different agenda, but here we must give the\nvoters the responsibility of keeping an eye on things.\n\nAll empires fall when the power to impose their will is lost. The decision by\nSchleswig-Holstein to evict Microsoft may not feel biblical right now: do not\ndoubt it could become so. The stakes are that high. The prophecy is for\ninteresting times ahead. \u00ae\n\n*Politicos elected in Munich in 2020 have indicated they back a shift to open source, though it's not clear how far along this is.\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * Open Source\n  * Windows\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * Open Source\n  * Windows\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Active Directory\n  * Audacity\n  * Azure\n  * Bing\n  * BSoD\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Excel\n  * Exchange Server\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * HoloLens\n  * Internet Explorer\n  * Jenkins\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Build\n  * Microsoft Edge\n  * Microsoft Ignite\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Surface\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * MySQL\n  * .NET\n  * Office 365\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Outlook\n  * Patch Tuesday\n  * Pluton\n  * PowerShell\n  * SharePoint\n  * Skype\n  * SQL Server\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 2000\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n  * Xbox\n  * Xbox 360\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Bill Gates\n  * Operating System\n\n#### More about\n\n31 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * Open Source\n  * Windows\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Microsoft\n  * Open Source\n  * Windows\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Active Directory\n  * Audacity\n  * Azure\n  * Bing\n  * BSoD\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * Excel\n  * Exchange Server\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * HoloLens\n  * Internet Explorer\n  * Jenkins\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Microsoft 365\n  * Microsoft Build\n  * Microsoft Edge\n  * Microsoft Ignite\n  * Microsoft Office\n  * Microsoft Surface\n  * Microsoft Teams\n  * MySQL\n  * .NET\n  * Office 365\n  * OpenOffice\n  * OS/2\n  * Outlook\n  * Patch Tuesday\n  * Pluton\n  * PowerShell\n  * SharePoint\n  * Skype\n  * SQL Server\n  * Visual Studio\n  * Visual Studio Code\n  * Wikipedia\n  * Windows 10\n  * Windows 11\n  * Windows 2000\n  * Windows 7\n  * Windows 8\n  * Windows Server\n  * Windows Server 2003\n  * Windows Server 2008\n  * Windows Server 2012\n  * Windows Server 2013\n  * Windows Server 2016\n  * Windows Subsystem for Linux\n  * Windows XP\n  * Xbox\n  * Xbox 360\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Bill Gates\n  * Operating System\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Want to keep Windows 10 secure?
