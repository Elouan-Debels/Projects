But nearly two years on from the 2022 Science paper^1, no one\noutside the original research group and their collaborators have been able to\nreproduce the results.\n\nNow, two teams have published a record of their replication attempts \u2014 and\nfailures. The studies, published on 27 March in Science Advances^2^,^3,\nsuggest that the original results were due to experimental error or data\ncherry-picking, not neuronal activity after all.\n\nBut the lead researcher behind the original technique stands by the results.\n\u201cI\u2019m also very curious as to why other groups fail in reproducing DIANA,\u201d says\nJang-Yeon Park, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) physicist at Sungkyunkwan\nUniversity in Suwon, South Korea.\n\nScience said in an e-mail to Nature that, although it\u2019s important to report\nthe negative results, the Science Advances studies \u201cdo not allow a definitive\nconclusion\u201d to be drawn about the original work, \u201cbecause there were\nmethodological differences between the papers\u201d.\n\n## \u2018Extraordinary claim\u2019\n\nIn conventional functional MRI (fMRI), researchers monitor changes in blood\nflow to different brain regions to estimate activity. But this response lags\nby at least one second behind the activity of neurons, which send messages in\nmilliseconds.\n\nPark and his co-authors said that DIANA could measure neuronal activity\ndirectly, which is an \u201cextraordinary claim\u201d, says Ben Inglis, a physicist at\nthe University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe DIANA technique works by applying minor electric shocks every 200\nmilliseconds to an anaesthetized animal. Between shocks, an MRI scanner\ncollects data from one tiny piece of the brain every 5 milliseconds. After the\nnext shock, another spot is scanned. The software stitches together data from\nall the spots, to visualize changes in an entire slice of brain over a\n200-millisecond period. The process is similar to filming an action pixel by\npixel, where the action would need to be repeated to record every pixel, and\nthose recordings stitched together, to create a full video.\n\nPark and his colleagues claimed that this approach suppressed the slower-paced\nsignal produced by changes in blood flow, which is what conventional fMRI\ntracks, and could measure the faster-paced signals produced when several\nneurons change their voltage.\n\n## Missing slices\n\nBut Park says that, as far as he knows, researchers outside his collaborative\nspheres have not been able to reproduce the results.\n\nOne published attempt^2 was led by Seong-Gi Kim, an MRI researcher at the\nInstitute for Basic Science in Suwon, who has previously worked with Park but\ndid not contribute to DIANA. Kim and his colleagues copied the original\npaper\u2019s protocol, with some enhancements. They found a DIANA-like signal\nresembling brain activity when they averaged data from 50 brain slices per\nmouse, but only if they removed data that didn\u2019t fit with the desired\nresponse. And the signal vanished when data from more than 1,000 brain slices\nfrom six mice were averaged.\n\nIn fMRI, averaging more brain slices should strengthen, not weaken, the brain-\nactivity signal, says Kim. Without enough data, he adds, background noise can\nlook like brain activity.\n\nIn the original Science paper, the team collected 48\u201398 brain slices per\nmouse, but examined only 40 for each animal, Park reports. The researchers say\nthey excluded slices so that they could compare a consistent number across all\nanimals, and removed those with the most background noise. But Park did not\nmention this until his team shared information with other laboratories hoping\nto use DIANA. He says that not including that step in the methods was an\noversight.\n\nPark adds that if the team non-selectively averaged data from just the first\n40 brain slices per mouse, and from all animals for up to about 700 brain\nslices, the DIANA response was weaker but still statistically significant.\n\nLast August, Science added an editorial expression of concern to the original\npaper, stating that \u201cthe methods described in the paper are inadequate to\nallow reproduction of the results\u201d and \u201cthe results may have been biased by\nsubjective data selection\u201d. The statement says that Science has asked Park to\nprovide more methods and data, and Park says he will submit the additional\ninformation by August. He says it takes time to re-analyse the relevant data\nand prepare detailed methods for reproducing DIANA.\n\n## Sequence of events\n\nValerie Phi Van, a radiologist and bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology (MIT) in Cambridge and a co-author of the other Science Advances\npaper^3, initially thought she had recreated the DIANA brain responses in a\nrat study.\n\nBut she also saw those signals when the electrical-stimulation tool was\ndisconnected, and even when dead rats were being scanned.\n\nLooking more closely at the sequence of events, she noticed a 12-microsecond\ndelay between when the electric shock was triggered and when the animal was\nactually shocked. When Phi Van removed the time gap, the supposed DIANA signal\ndisappeared.\n\nCo-author Alan Jasanoff, a bioengineer and neuroscientist at MIT, says the\ndelay caused \u201ca little fluctuation in the [baseline] MRI signal\u201d that looked\nlike a DIANA response.\n\nPark disagrees that the observed response in the original paper was due to\nmistimed electrical stimulation, because he says he had previously corrected\nfor a similar aberration in the MRI baseline.\n\nPark has continued to refine the DIANA method and says he has reproduced it in\nongoing animal and human studies. He encourages researchers who have had\ndifficulties to contact him, and says he has already shared data with\nscientists at nearly a dozen institutions.\n\nHowever, the latest Science Advances papers have cast doubt on the original\nfindings. It\u2019s clear that the signals DIANA detects are \u201cnot necessarily\nrelated to neural signal\u201d, says Shella Keilholz, an MRI physicist and\nneuroscientist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Although, she says,\nit\u2019s possible that brain activity contributed to the detected signals.\n\nNeuroscientists will continue to explore the cause of the conflicting results.\nAnd that could have an upside, says Noam Shemesh, an MRI researcher at the\nChampalimaud Foundation in Lisbon. The original paper and attempts to\nreplicate or rebut it could lead researchers towards developing and finessing\nmore-direct ways to measure neural activity, he says.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00931-x\n\n## References\n\n  1.
