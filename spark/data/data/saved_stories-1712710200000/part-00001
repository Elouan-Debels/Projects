Google Vids\nwas briefly mentioned as an \"all-in-one video creation app\" in a Google blog\npost on Tuesday. That blog post is nearly useless when it comes to learning\nabout what Vids actually does, but thankfully outlets like The Verge, we get\nto see it in action.\n\nSEE ALSO: Open AI and Google trained AI models on YouTube videos\n\n## What is the 'Google Vids' app?\n\nPut simply, Vids is a simple video creation app meant for work purposes.\nYou're supposed to use it to create slide presentations using a simple left-\nto-right timeline that you insert things from your Google Drive into. You can\nalso add voiceover or footage of yourself speaking for a little added oomph.\n\nWhat makes Vids interesting, however, is that it integrates Google's Gemini AI\ninto the creation suite. Users can (optionally) ask Gemini to write scripts,\nbuild storyboards, and even read scripts out loud using text-to-speech. It can\nalso draw from a library of stock footage and even create images itself.\n\nVids is currently in testing by a small number of Workspace users, with plans\nto launch a more open beta version in the summer. Be on the lookout for work\npresentations that look suspiciously AI-generated when that happens.\n\nTopics Artificial Intelligence Google\n\nRecommended For You\n\nThe best alternatives to Pornhub and XVideos\n\nWe all deserve better porn.\n\n03/08/2024\n\nBy Jess Joho and Anna Iovine\n\nNYT's The Mini crossword answers for April 4\n\nStuck on any of the clues?
