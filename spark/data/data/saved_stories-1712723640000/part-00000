Systems known as the \u201cInternet of\nThings\u201d (IoT), hold much potential for improving the efficiency and safety of\nthe equipment.\n\nA pyroelectrochemical (PEC) cell, is a device that converts thermal energy\ninto electricity and stores it.

In theory, the PEC could power sensors for IoT\napplications that would otherwise be impractical to recharge.\n\nA solar cell would work fine in some situations, according to Roundy, a co-\nauthor of the study.\n\n\u201cBut in a lot of environments, you run into two problems,\u201d said Roundy. \u201cOne\nis that it gets dirty over time. Solar cells have to be kept clean. So in\nthese types of applications, they get dirty and their power degrades. And then\nthere are a lot of applications where you just don\u2019t have sunlight available.\nFor example, we work on soil sensors that we put just under the top surface of\nthe soil. You\u2019re not going to get any sunlight.\u201d\n\nThe PEC uses a pyroelectric composite material, as the separator in an\nelectrochemical cell. The material consists of porous polyvinylidene fluoride\n(PVDF) and barium titanate nanoparticles. This material\u2019s electrical\nproperties change as it\u2019s heated or cooled, which decreases or increases the\npolarization of the pyroelectric separator\n\nChanging temperatures create an electric field inside the cell, pushing ions\naround and enabling the cell store to energy.\n\nFrom left, Roseanne Warren, Shad Roundy and Tim Kowalchik pictured in Warren\u2019s\nlab with a pyroelectrochemical (PEC) cell.

This is a glorified\ncapacitor,\u201d said lead author Tim Kowalchik, a graduate student in Warren\u2019s\nlab. \u201cWhen you heat and cool the system and you\u2019re storing electrochemical\nenergy, you\u2019re changing the amount of positive or negative ions that are in\nthose layers.\u201d\n\nThe new study tested the lab\u2019s theory of how the cell would operate.\n\n\u201cWe had a predicted model of function that included what we called an\n\u2018orientation effect\u2019 in the paper,\u201d Kowalchik said. \u201cIf we change the reverse\nthe orientation of separator in the cell, it should drive ions the other way.\nThis is a change we can make to the system that will show a different result\nthat we can gather.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s experiments were set up to determine if the cells would respond as\nthey predicted. Besides the orientation effect, there were heating vs. cooling\neffects that needed to be tested.\n\n\u201cIf you heat the thing one way, you should get something to happen. If you\ncool it first, you should get something to happen and that should show up\ndifferently,\u201d Kowalchik said. \u201cWe did that with a process called amperometry.\nYou put a voltage across it and you hold that voltage constant and measure\ncurrent. Your energy into the system is constant if nothing changes; if there\nis energy going into the system, the current changes.\u201d\n\nThe cell did respond as the team theorized it would, but can it work outside a\nlab? That\u2019s the next question Warren seeks to address. One of her students is\nnow undertaking circuit modeling to design a cell and optimize its function.\n\n\u201cNow we start to change different parameters,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHow can we\nimprove the energy harvesting and storage and the combination of the two? And\nthen after that would be a real-world field demonstration.\u201d\n\nThe cell could produce up to 100 microjoules per square centimeter from a\nsingle heating/cooling cycle, which is not much energy, but enough to be\nuseful for IoT purposes, according to the research.\n\n\u201cYou want to monitor the condition of your car, the condition of machines, the\ncondition of plants and soil and those kinds of things. Those types of sensors\nare generally going to be quite a bit lower power than your smartwatch or your\nphone, which have a display and they\u2019re transmitting a lot of data,\u201d Roundy\nsaid. \u201cThe sensors we\u2019re talking about might just give periodic updates and\nthey operate autonomously. They don\u2019t have an interface or a screen.\u201d\n\nThe study, titled \u201cDirect Conversion of Thermal Energy to Stored\nElectrochemical Energy via a Self-Charging Pyroelectrochemical Cell,\u201d was\nfunded by the National Science Foundation. Also contributing were Fariha Khan\nand Danielle Horlacher. Horlacher is an undergraduate art student who has been\nworking for Warren\u2019s group on scientific illustrations.
