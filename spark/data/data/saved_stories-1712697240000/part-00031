In 2023, it cost US$30 to check a standard bag in with\nthe airline; today, as of March 2024, it costs $40 at a U.S. airport \u2013 a\nwhopping 33% increase.\n\nAs a business school professor who studies travel, I\u2019m often asked why\nairlines alienate their customers with baggage fees instead of bundling all\ncharges together. There are many reasons, but an important, often overlooked\ncause is buried in the U.S. tax code.\n\n## A tax-law loophole\n\nAirlines pay the federal government 7.5% of the ticket price when flying\npeople domestically, alongside other fees. The airlines dislike these charges,\nwith their trade association arguing that they boost the cost to the consumer\nof a typical air ticket by around one-fifth.\n\nHowever, the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations specifically excludes baggage\nfrom the 7.5% transportation tax as long as \u201cthe charge is separable from the\npayment for the transportation of a person and is shown in the exact amount.\u201d\n\nThis means if an airline charges a combined $300 to fly you and a bag round-\ntrip within the U.S., it owes $22.50 in tax. If the airline charges $220 to\nfly you plus separately charges $40 each way for the bag, then your total cost\nis the same \u2014 but the airline only owes the government $16.50 in taxes.\nSplitting out baggage charges saves the airline $6.\n\nNow $6 might not seem like much, but it can add up. Last year, passengers took\nmore than 800 million trips on major airlines. Even if only a fraction of them\ncheck their bags, that means large savings for the industry.\n\nHow large? The government has tracked revenue from bag fees for decades. In\n2002, airlines charged passengers a total of $180 million to check bags, which\nworked out to around 33 cents per passenger.\n\nToday, as any flyer can attest, bag fees are a lot higher. Airlines collected\nover 40 times more money in bag fees last year than they did in 2002.\n\nWhen the full data is in for 2023, total bag fees will likely top $7 billion,\nwhich is about $9 for the average domestic passenger. By splitting out the\ncost of bags, airlines avoided paying about half a billion dollars in taxes\njust last year.\n\nIn the two decades since 2002, flyers paid a total of about $70 billion in bag\nfees. This means separately charging for bags saved airlines about $5 billion\nin taxes.\n\nIt seems clear to me that tax savings are one driver of the unbundling of\nbaggage fees because of a quirk in the law.\n\nThe U.S. government doesn\u2019t apply the 7.5% tax to international flights that\ngo more than 225 miles beyond the nation\u2019s borders. Instead, there are fixed\ninternational departure and arrival taxes. This is why major airlines charge\n$35 to $40 for bags if you\u2019re flying domestically, but don\u2019t charge a bag fee\nwhen you\u2019re flying to Europe or Asia.\n\n## Do travelers get anything for that money?\n\nThis system raises an interesting question: Do baggage fees force airlines to\nbe more careful with bags, since customers who pay more expect better service?\nTo find out, I checked with the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, which has\nbeen tracking lost luggage for decades.\n\nFor many years, it calculated the number of mishandled-baggage reports per\nthousand airline passengers. The government\u2019s data showed mishandled bags\npeaked in 2007 with about seven reports of lost or damaged luggage for every\nthousand passengers. That means you could expect your luggage to go on a\ndifferent trip than the one you are taking about once every 140 or so flights.\nBy 2018, that estimate had fallen to once every 350 flights.\n\nIn 2019, the government changed how it tracks mishandled bags, calculating\nfigures based on the total number of bags checked, rather than the total\nnumber of passengers. The new data show about six bags per thousand checked\nget lost or damaged, which is less than 1% of checked bags. Unfortunately, the\ndata doesn\u2019t show improvement since 2019.\n\nIs there anything that you can do about higher bag fees? Complaining to\npoliticians probably won\u2019t help. In 2010, two senators tried to ban bag fees,\nand their bill went nowhere.\n\nGiven that congressional action failed, there\u2019s a simple way to avoid higher\nbag fees: travel light and don\u2019t check any luggage. It may sound tough not to\nhave all your belongings when traveling, but it might be the best option as\nbag fees take off.\n\n  * Economy\n  * Travel\n  * Airlines\n  * Pricing\n  * Taxes\n  * Air travel\n  * Fees\n  * Business\n  * US airlines\n  * Airline Industry\n  * Quick reads\n  * Travel industry\n\n### Events\n\nMore events\n\n### Jobs\n\n  * ##### Project Officer, Student Volunteer Program\n\n  * ##### Audience Development Coordinator (fixed-term maternity cover)\n\n  * ##### Lecturer (Hindi-Urdu)\n\n  * ##### Director, Defence and Security\n\n  * ##### Opportunities with the new CIEHF\n\nMore jobs\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation Media Group Ltd\n\n", "frontpage": true}
