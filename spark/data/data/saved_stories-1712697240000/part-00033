Because I have to order\ningredients in certain quantities, I often wind up with more than I need for\nmy project.\n\nSo I\u2019ve opened a Tindie store, called Overengineered Widget Laboratories.\nRight now there\u2019s one product in the store, called Keypad:GO. See, I built a\nsculpture last summer that needed to interact with people through a phone-\nstyle keypad. The keypad interface part of it seemed like something other\npeople could use, so I made a few extras. This is a very easy way to interface\na keypad or small keyboard to an embedded electronics project, because it\nhandles all the basics for you \u2014 matrix scanning, debouncing, key matrix\ncollisions, etc.\n\nIt will also help you reverse engineer the keypad\u2019s circuit, because often\ncheap keypads arrive without good documentation. In the tiny flash of the\nembedded microcontroller, I\u2019ve packed a setup wizard that will walk you\nthrough the process of setting up the keypad of your choice. All you need is a\nterminal program. This is honestly my favorite part, and I demonstrate it in\nthe video below.\n\nHere\u2019s Keypad:GO on the back of a cheap keypad from the internet, being wired\nup by my tiny dinosaur assistant, Gargantua.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the demonstration video:\n\nAfter that process is done, it just produces key characters over serial or I2C\n\u2014 so it can interface with basically any embedded platform.\n\nThere\u2019s a detailed user manual with more dinosaurs if you\u2019d like to know more.\n\nI\u2019ve published the schematic (linked in the manual). I haven\u2019t published the\nsource code yet, but plan to. (It\u2019s written in Rust on top of lilos, like most\nof my personal projects these days.)\n\nIf this looks useful to you and you want to help fund my electronics habit, I\nstill have a few of them in stock as of this writing!\n\n#async #embedded #hardware #lilos #rust\n\n", "frontpage": false}
