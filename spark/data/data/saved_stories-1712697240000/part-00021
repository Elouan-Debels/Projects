Positioning is the act of deliberately defining how you are the best at something that a defined market cares a lot about.\n\n  2. If we fail in positioning, we fail at marketing and sales, the entire business line fails.\n\n  3. Positioning is \"context setting\" for products. Its about little clues that we piece together from our current understanding of the environment to understand the new product.\n\n  4. Startups have used positioning to transform from an irrelevant product to a must have product. Tech founders have this problem where they are too close to their product that they aren't able to see the product from the eyes of their customers.\n\n  5. For a product to be successful, customer must be able to understand the product, why it is special and ascertain the value proposition of the product. This is where positioning comes into play.\n\n  6. Weak positioning leaves a trail:\n\n    1. New customers can't figure out what the product is about.\n\n    2. Long sales cycles and low close rates\n\n    3. High customer churn immediately after onboarding or purchase.\n\n    4. Customer's constantly complain that the prices are too high.\n\nFollowing are the steps in crafting a compelling message:\n\n  1. What do you do ?\n\nExample: \u201cI do copy writing.\u201d\n\nAnother example would be Vevesta - Find features, techniques and projects used\nby your peers in their Machine learning projects.\n\n  2. Why does it matter ?\n\nExample: \u201cI make landing pages that convert better\u201d.\n\nThis is the most important step, as customers need to understand why they need\nto use your product.\n\nAnother example would be : Vevesta - Accelerate development of your Machine\nlearning project by using features, techniques and projects used by your\npeers.\n\n  3. Make it attractive\n\nExample: \u201cI make landing pages that are so good that your phone will not stop\nringing.\u201d\n\nMost people jump to this step and develop a marketing message that doesn\u2019t\nmean anything. An example of marketing message that didn\u2019t make sense was\nVevesta - Your collective brain. This is description we developed and later\nrealised people coming to the website didn\u2019t understand the product itself.\n\nSo we revisited our product description and crafted the following message:\n\nFeature and Technique Dictionary - Accelerate your Machine learning project by\nusing features, techniques and projects used by your peers.\n\nThanks for reading Build Startup In Public !
