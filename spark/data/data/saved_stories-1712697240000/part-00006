The housewife-turned-MBA who was splashed on the cover of\nInc. magazine, lionized in Savvy and interviewed at reverent length by the\nHarvard Business Review?\n\nIf you have forgotten, it\u2019s not surprising. Vector Graphic, the company Lore\nand Bob Harp founded nine years ago on their kitchen table in Westlake\nVillage, was ambushed a few years back by management blunders and a good-sized\ncompetitor by the name of IBM.\n\nToday Vector is as shrunken as a punctured beach ball and right back in\nWestlake Village--practically on a kitchen table again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVector\u2019s history is a classic story of success and failure in the computer\nbusiness, a cautionary tale for energetic entrepreneurs caught up in the\nmystique of management.\n\nThe company is controlled these days by the ill-starred venture capitalists\nwho helped fund it. Few people work there. Its stock has plummeted.\n\nMerger Postponed\n\nAnd now the company, whose chief executive boasted of facing down Wall Street\nunderwriters with her unyielding demands, is wanted mostly for a transferable\ntax loss exceeding $10 million. Even so, a proposed merger to exploit the loss\nhas been postponed.\n\nThe Harps, meanwhile, are divorced.\n\nAt its peak in 1982, Vector Graphic was a computer company with $36.2 million\nin sales, $2.4 million in profits and an important place in the up-and-coming\npersonal-computer industry. It had 425 workers in a huge Thousand Oaks\nfacility,\n\nWhat went wrong? \u201cIt was a series of blunders,\u201d said Donald Sinsabaugh, who\nused to follow the company for the securities firm of Swergold, Chefitz &\nSinsabaugh in New York. Lore Harp, he said, \u201cis not to blame alone. But she\nwas the leading light of that company. Being the person who would have taken\nthe credit, she\u2019s the one who has to live with the failure.\u201d\n\nSinsabaugh said he doesn\u2019t follow Vector anymore, because \u201cno one cares about\ndead horses.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Harps have moved on to other things. Bob is chairman of Corona Data\nSystems, a privately held computer company in Thousand Oaks that he founded a\nmonth after leaving Vector. Corona, which posted sales of $64 million last\nyear, reported turning its first profit last year and that it is roughly\nbreaking even this year.\n\nSuccess Story Turned Sour\n\nLore Harp is in San Mateo, where she has started a new company, Aplex Corp.\nEarlier this summer, she said it was planning to patent a feminine hygiene\nproduct.\n\nShe is reluctant to talk about Vector now. But when she does, she says several\nthings turned her success story sour--\u201dthe entry of IBM,\u201d \u201ctoo many cooks\nstirring the broth\u201d and, finally, \u201clots of things.\u201d\n\nA strong-willed German emigrant, Lore Harp was 32 back in 1976 and\ndissatisfied with her comfortable suburban life as mother and homemaker. She\ntried law school, but the workload, coupled with the demands of her family,\nwere too much. At the same time, her husband, who holds a Stanford doctorate\nin electrical engineering, was looking for someone to market a computer memory\nboard he had designed.\n\nBob Harp was working for Hughes Research Laboratories, and Lore Harp wanted to\nstart a business. So she and the Harps\u2019 next-door neighbor, former bond trader\nCarole Ely, decided to market the memory board themselves.\n\nAfter the company was mapped out in the kitchen, the headquarters became the\ndownstairs bedroom. Capital was $6,000. The product was a kit for Bob\u2019s\ncircuit board, a device to expand a computer\u2019s memory, packed on the floor by\nEly and Lore Harp. Letters signed by Lore Harp had LH/mtf typed in the corner,\nwhich looked official, but stood for \u201cLore Harp/my two fingers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBowls Held Components\n\nGrowth was accommodated by getting bowls from the kitchen to keep the little\ncomponents separated. The children were enlisted as assemblers. Later, high\nschool students were hired part time.\n\nIn December, 1976, five months after incorporating, Vector moved to 1,200\nsquare feet of rented space and hired two full-time workers. Five months later\nit moved into even larger quarters.\n\nOnce the company was a going concern, Bob Harp quit Hughes and joined Vector\nfull-time, designing its first full-scale personal-computer system. It hit the\nmarket in 1977, and Vector was off and running, in the forefront of the\npersonal-computer boom. The company soon became a leader in small, multiuser\nsystems.\n\nBy 1980, Lore Harp had obtained her MBA from Pepperdine University, and, by\nher account, felt challenged and fulfilled in her role as president and chief\nexecutive. Bob Harp was chairman and vice president for research and\ndevelopment, using his expertise to design Vector\u2019s products.\n\nCurse of Fixed Keyboard\n\nThose products were well-regarded generally, but they weren\u2019t perfect. Critics\ncomplained that the Vector 3, for example, was uncomfortable to use.\n\n\u201cThe thing that killed the Vector 3 was a fixed keyboard,\u201d said Michael\nMurphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Newsletter. \u201cIt never caught\non.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, the company\u2019s growth was rapid. For the year ended June 30,\n1977, sales were $400,000. The next two years they were $2 million and $4.9\nmillion, respectively.\n\nFor the year ended June 30, 1980, Vector earned $1.3 million on sales of $11.9\nmillion. The next year, earnings were $2.6 million on sales of $25 million.\nAbout four months later Vector went public, and the Harps were in the money.\n\n\u2018Accepting the Challenge\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a million and a half dollars richer, and it\u2019s totally unimportant . . . \u201c\nLore Harp told the Harvard Business Review in the interview published in the\nsummer of 1982. \u201cWhat I really enjoy is growing the company, growing people\nwithin the company, accepting the challenge of being out there, competing\nagainst other companies and making an impact. Power may have something to do\nwith it as well. I won\u2019t deny that.\u201d\n\nBut Vector already was past its prime. IBM introduced the IBM-PC in August,\n1981, the year of Vector\u2019s greatest profit, and by 1982 the decline had begun.\nVector still made money and showed record sales. But net income fell from $2.6\nmillion to $2.4 million for the year ending June 30, 1982, and the per-share\ndecline was even sharper--to 43 cents, from 52.\n\nOne reason was that the company announced its new Vector 4 computer\nprematurely. Vector 4 was a kind of bridge system. Although not fully IBM-\ncompatible, it ran software for IBM as well as for the CP/M system, the most\ncommon other operating system then on the market. It also had a detached\nkeyboard.\n\nUnfortunately, the accidental announcement of the product in April--somebody\nin marketing placed an ad prematurely, according to Bob Harp--immediately put\na damper on sales of the older Vector 3, backing up millions of dollars in\ninventory. Even worse, Vector 4 wasn\u2019t ready for shipment until four months\nlater.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlow to Adjust to IBM\n\nVector was slow to adjust to the dominance of IBM, Murphy said, and to this\nday it still doesn\u2019t make a machine that is fully IBM compatible.\n\nApril of 1982 was the cruelest month for Vector in other ways, too: It was\nwhen Bob Harp left.\n\n\u201cIt was a dispute over who would run the company, and she prevailed,\u201d Bob Harp\nsaid recently.\n\nA month after leaving Vector, he founded Corona and the couple were divorced\nsoon after that.\n\nBob Harp\u2019s departure hurt the company severely, according to Sinsabaugh, and,\ncoupled with the Vector 4 snafu and the entry of IBM into the market, it\nhelped propel Vector\u2019s long slide. Bob Harp blames the slide on his ex-wife.\n\n\u2018Didn\u2019t Develop New Projects\u2019\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t develop any successful products after I left there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf\nthe proper decisions had been made, it would be quite successful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey were so convinced they were on track that they didn\u2019t develop new\nproducts,\u201d said Bernardus Smit, president of Dual Systems Control Corp.,\nVector\u2019s proposed merger partner.\n\nBob Harp also complains that the birth and near death of Vector cost him more\nthan his marriage. He liquidated the remains of his million-share stake in the\ncompany last year for 10 cents a share. At one time shares sold for $17; now\nthey\u2019re worth about 31 cents.\n\nThe focus on Lore Harp intensified about the time of her husband\u2019s departure.\nShe had already been on the cover of Inc. in 1981. Then came the Harvard\nBusiness Review interview.\n\n\u2018Very Fast Decisions\u2019\n\nAsked if risk-taking was a problem, as it is sometimes alleged to be for\nfemale entrepreneurs, Harp responded: \u201cNot at all, because one of the things I\ncan do is make very fast decisions. . . . What makes me so mad many times\nduring staff meeting is when people come up with reasons why something can\u2019t\nbe done. I say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you give me just one reason why it can be done?\u2019 \u201d\n\nSavvy did a piece in July, 1983. In it, Lore Harp cited management guru Peter\nDrucker on the challenge of managing turmoil. She acknowledged turmoil at\nVector, but said she had learned from it.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m a much stronger manager now--this has been a time of great\npersonal growth for me,\u201d she was quoted as saying. \u201cThe spirit here is, once\nagain, tremendous; people are committed. And right now I demand a 150%\ncommitment or I say, \u2018get out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe said she also ordered an end to memos: \u201cI say, look the person in the eye,\ndiscuss the problem. Only write down action items and policy matters.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Take Careful Aim\u2019\n\nThe Savvy article recognized Vector\u2019s troubles--it lost $3 million in the 12\nmonths ended June 30, 1983--but suggested the company would prevail.\n\n\u201cHarp\u2019s got the strength,\u201d the article concluded. \u201cAll she has to do is pull\nthe slingshot back far enough and take careful aim with the stone.\u201d\n\nBob Harp scoffs at all this, arguing that the people running Vector got caught\nup in their executive roles instead of concentrating on the products that\nwould make or break the company.\n\n\u201cThe people there started to act like managers,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen that may not\nhave had anything to do with their success.\u201d\n\nBut Lore Harp, who finally left Vector at the end of 1983, said products were\nfar from ignored.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Sad\u2019\n\n\u201cWe had fantastic stuff on the drawing board,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s chairman now is Jean Deleage, a San Francisco venture capitalist\nwhose firm, Burr, Egan, Deleage & Co., held about 21% of Vector\u2019s stock as of\nJune 30, 1984, according to Vector\u2019s 1984 annual report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVector is now being run by its proposed merger partner, Dual Systems, a\nprivately held computer company in Berkeley.\n\nSmit said Vector has about three dozen employees now, and recently moved from\na 110,000-square-foot facility to its 10,000-square-foot headquarters back in\nWestlake Village. The new space is \u201cmore than enough,\u201d he said, to handle\noffice operations as well as the assembly and shipping of computers.\n\nDual has annual sales of $10 million to $20 million, Smit said. Dual is\nprofitable, so it can take advantage of Vector\u2019s tax losses, and it also wants\nto use the merger to become a public company, he said.\n\n\u2018Practically a Gift\u2019\n\n\u201cProbably it\u2019s practically a gift,\u201d said Murphy, the newsletter editor. \u201cFor\nthe venture capitalists, it\u2019s a way to exit the whole thing with some degree\nof honor.\u201d\n\nSmit said his plans for Vector are to pursue several market niches in which\nVector is well-established, such as doctors\u2019 and lawyers\u2019 offices and the Arab\nworld.\n\n\u201cThe market is much more differentiated than most people have in mind,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nBut Smit said the merger has been postponed indefinitely, and he won\u2019t explain\nwhy, except to say that many things have to be worked out before the letter of\nintent between the companies can be executed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials of Vector did not return repeated phone calls for comment.\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### Should you itemize or take a standard deduction on your tax return?
