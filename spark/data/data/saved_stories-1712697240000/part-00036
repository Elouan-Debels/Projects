But from there,\ndisagreement is the rule.\n\nFor critics, Bitcoin\u2019s thirst for energy is self-evidently bad \u2014 the\nequivalent of pouring gasoline in a hole and setting it on fire. But for\nBitcoin advocates, the network\u2019s energy gluttony is the necessary price of\nhaving a secure digital currency. When judging Bitcoin\u2019s energy demands, the\nadvocates continue, keep in mind that mainstream finance is itself no model of\nefficiency.\n\nHere, I think the advocates have a point.\n\nIf you want to argue that Bitcoin is an energy hog, you\u2019ve got to do more than\njust point at its energy budget and say \u2018bad\u2019. You\u2019ve got to show that this\nbudget is worse than mainstream finance.\n\nOn this comparison front, there seems to be a vacuum of good information. For\ntheir part, crypto promoters are happy to show that Bitcoin uses less energy\nthan the global banking system. But this result is as unsurprising as it is\nmeaningless. Compared to Bitcoin, global finance operates on a vastly larger\nscale. So of course it uses more energy.\n\nTo be meaningful, any comparison between Bitcoin and mainstream finance must\naccount for the different scales of the two systems. So instead of looking at\nenergy alone, we need to look at energy intensity \u2014 the energy per unit of\ncirculating currency. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do here. In this post, I compare the\nenergy intensity of Bitcoin to the energy intensity of mainstream US finance.\n\nWhich system comes out on top? The results may surprise you.\n\n### Proof of energy wasted\n\nAlthough many people know that the Bitcoin network uses lots of electricity,\nthe reasons for this energy appetite remain widely misunderstood. So before we\nget to the energy data, it\u2019s worth pausing for a brief primer on how the\nBitcoin network works.\n\nFor starters, the Bitcoin network is nothing but a database \u2014 a monetary\nledger that records transactions of digital currency. For their part, banks\nhave a similar ledger that tracks how their customers spend money. With banks,\nhowever, the database is private and under their exclusive command. Not so\nwith Bitcoin. Think of the Bitcoin database like the banking equivalent of\nWikipedia. Anyone can read the ledger, and anyone can (in principle) write to\nit.\n\nAdmittedly, this latter part sounds crazy. If anyone can write to the Bitcoin\nledger, it means fraud should be pervasive. (Why write a legitimate\ntransaction when you can write a fraudulent one that benefits you?) And that\u2019s\nprecisely why write access to Bitcoin\u2019s database comes with a caveat. To write\ntransactions to the Bitcoin ledger, you must demonstrate that you\u2019ve paid a\ntoll. The purpose of this toll is simple: it makes writing to the ledger so\nexpensive that fraud doesn\u2019t payoff.\n\nNow here\u2019s the interesting part. On the Bitcoin network, the toll is\ncomputational. To gain write access to the database, Bitcoin users must\ndemonstrate that they\u2019ve solved a computationally intensive puzzle.\nImportantly, the only purpose of this puzzle is to prove to the community that\nyou\u2019ve wasted significant amounts of energy \u2014 so much energy that fraud\nbecomes impractical.\n\nNow in crypto circles, this approach is know as \u2018proof-of-work\u2019. To write a\nblock of transactions to the blockchain (the ledger), you must prove that\nyou\u2019ve done the work needed to solve a taxing hash problem. But since the\n\u2018work\u2019 is done exclusively by electricity-guzzling machines, the system is\nmore aptly described as \u2018proof-of-energy-wasted\u2019. It is a system purposefully\ndesigned to waste electricity.\n\n### Keeping numbers scarce\n\nLooking at Bitcoin\u2019s built-in waste, critics see enormous \u2018inefficiency\u2019. But\nI think that\u2019s presumptuous. Built-in waste is not unique to cryptocurrency.\nIt\u2019s part of all financial systems.\n\nTo see this waste, it helps to think about the nature of \u2018money\u2019. In the most\nbasic sense, money is just a mathematical idea. It\u2019s a set of accounting rules\nattached to a system of property rights. Now, since numbers cost nothing to\nconjure, there\u2019s no physical reason to waste energy on money \u2018creation\u2019.\nAnyone can conjure money, anytime they want.\n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely the problem. Numbers are infinitely plentiful. But money\nmust be scarce. It is this (artificial) scarcity that converts numbers into\n\u2018currency\u2019. Without it, monetary accounting quickly devolves into the\nchildren\u2019s game of number conjuring:\n\n\u201cI have a thousand dollars,\u201d says Alice.\n\n\u201cI have a million dollars,\u201d says Bob.\n\n\u201cI have a billion dollars,\u201d says Charlotte.\n\nAnd so on, to infinity.\n\nAdults may laugh at this childhood naivety, but the joke is on us. Numbers can\nbe conjured at will, exactly as the children understand. But what the children\ndon\u2019t understand are the (arbitrary) monetary rules that adults have\ninternalized. To make numbers behave like money, we create rules about how\nmonetary values can be conjured. Break these rules and you haven\u2019t \u2018created\u2019\nmoney. You\u2019ve forged it.\n\nIt\u2019s with \u2018forgery\u2019 that energy enters the picture. You see, it requires\nenergy to ensure that monetary numbers are not conjured freely.\n\nPaper cash is a good example of this principle. In essence, cash is a number\ndelivery mechanism \u2014 a way to give monetary numbers a physical form. Since it\nis the numbers (not the paper) that matter, the design of a cash bill could be\nutterly simple \u2014 nothing but a digit scrawled on a plain piece of paper. Yet\ndespite this modest requirement, actual cash has an elaborate design. Why?\n\nThe purpose of cash\u2019s intricate design is to waste energy. By giving cash a\ncomplicated look, governments enforce monetary scarcity by making number\nconjuring expensive. If counterfeiters want to print money, they have to waste\nenergy copying the government\u2019s design. Sure, a few counterfeiters will take\nthe challenge. But for most people, the cost of mimicking government cash\nisn\u2019t worth the payoff.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the cost of getting caught. To maintain their monopoly\nover money creation, governments actively prosecute and punish \u2018illegitimate\u2019\nnumber conjurers. Like Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work mechanism, this penal system is\nnothing but designed-in waste. Its purpose is to maintain monetary scarcity by\nupping the cost of fraud.^1\n\nTurning from paper cash to currencies based on precious metal, the built-in\nwaste is even more severe. To conjure metal-based money, we\u2019re forced to rip\nrare elements from the Earth\u2019s bowels. With gold, that means wasting about 1.5\nmegajoules of energy to conjure a single US dollar.^2 It\u2019s the antithesis of\nefficiency. And that\u2019s the point. Gold is a universal currency precisely\nbecause it\u2019s scarcity provides a way to reign in number conjuring. If there\nwere some highly efficient method for creating gold \u2014 say alchemy \u2014 it would\nruin gold\u2019s monetary appeal.\n\nWith Bitcoin, the situation is similar. Bitcoin\u2019s creator, the pseudonymous\n\u2018Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019, realized that money is simply an accounting ledger that\nkeeps numbers scarce by enforcing a set of rules. How are the rules enforce?\nBy wasting energy.\n\nLooking at the prospect of a digital currency, Satoshi decided that it made\nsense for the scarcity-inducing waste to be computational. Hence we get\nBitcoin\u2019s use of \u2018proof-of-work\u2019 \u2014 a purposefully wasteful algorithm that is\ndesigned solely to enforce the rules of the monetary ledger.^3\n\nSo does Bitcoin waste loads of energy? Absolutely. But so do all monetary\nsystems. The important question, then, is whether Bitcoin\u2019s waste budget is\nworse than other forms of currency. And that remains an open question.\n\n### Bitcoin\u2019s energy appetite\n\nLifting the hood of the Bitcoin network, let\u2019s now look at its energy demands.\nFigure 1 shows one of the more rigorous estimates of Bitcoin\u2019s evolving energy\nbudget.\n\nThe data comes from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index\n(CBECI), and works as follows. The CBECI first looks at the Bitcoin \u2018hash\nrate\u2019 \u2014 the rate that Bitcoin miners guess solutions to their proof-of-work\npuzzles. Next, the CBECI looks at the technology used for hashing and\nestimates its \u2018efficiency\u2019 \u2014 the hash output per unit of electricity input.\nFinally, the CBECI divides the hash rate by the hashing efficiency, giving an\nestimate for Bitcoin\u2019s electricity budget.\n\nIn this calculation, the main unknown is the mix of hashing technology used by\nminers. The CBECI knows which technology is available (on the market), but not\nwhat\u2019s actually employed. Hence there\u2019s significant uncertainty in their\nenergy estimate.\n\nFortunately, the growth of Bitcoin\u2019s energy budget has been so spectacular\nthat the surrounding uncertainty is relegated to background noise. Figure 1\nshows the pattern. Over the last fourteen years, Bitcoin\u2019s energy thirst has\ngrown by a factor of a million. (The shaded region shows the uncertainty in\nthis estimate.)\n\nFigure 1: A growing glutton \u2014 the energy used by the Bitcoin network. Since\nits inception in 2010, the Bitcoin network\u2019s energy use has grown\ndramatically. Here, I\u2019ve plotted energy estimates from the Cambridge Bitcoin\nElectricity Consumption Index. Note that I\u2019ve expressed the energy use as an\nannualized rate in units of primary energy equivalent. Also note the log scale\non the vertical axis. [Sources and methods]\n\nAs of early 2024, Bitcoin\u2019s energy budget stands at roughly one million\nTerajoules. No doubt this number sounds large. However, energy units are\nnotorious for being unintuitive. So before we continue, it\u2019s helpful to place\nBitcoin\u2019s energy consumption on a more understandable scale.\n\nFor their part, journalists like to point out that Bitcoin uses more energy\nthan \u2018entire countries\u2019. It\u2019s an apt comparison. Figure 2 show\u2019s Bitcoins\nenergy budget on the scale of various countries. When the Bitcoin network\nfirst got rolling, it used as much energy as the tiny island nation of\nKiribati (population: 100,000). But today, Bitcoin uses as much energy as Sri\nLanka (population: 20 million).\n\nFigure 2: Bitcoin\u2019s energy thirst on a country scale. This chart plots the\nsame data as Figure 1, but replaces the Terajoule scale with a country-\nequivalent scale. Note that the vertical axis uses a log scale. [Sources and\nmethods]\n\n### Endemic waste in mainstream finance\n\nNow that we\u2019ve estimated Bitcoin\u2019s energy appetite, it\u2019s time to do the same\nfor its primary alternative \u2014 namely, mainstream finance. Here, things get\nmore difficult.\n\nThe sticking point has to do with what system scientists call \u2018boundaries\u2019. To\nmeasure the energy used by a system, you\u2019ve got to first define the boundaries\nwhere the system begins and ends. The more expansive your boundaries, the more\nenergy you\u2019ll end up counting.\n\nLooking at the mainstream financial system, it\u2019s not clear how we should\ndefine our energy boundaries. A tempting option is to simply reuse our Bitcoin\nmethod and sum the electricity use by banking computers. But I think this\napproach is a bad idea, because it misunderstands the difference between the\ntwo systems.\n\nWhen you walk into a Bitcoin mining operation, you see nothing but energy-\nburning computers. But when you walk into a traditional bank, you see much\nmore than that. Sure there are computers. But there\u2019s also a brick-and-mortar\noffice building. And most importantly, the bank is full of people.\nCollectively, the finance industry employees millions of people who are\ngenerally well paid. It\u2019s here that we find mainstream finance\u2019s primary form\nof waste.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve insulted everyone who works in finance, let me back up a bit.\nWe\u2019re not accustomed to treating people\u2019s income as a form of \u2018waste\u2019. So let\nme make the connection.\n\nThink of Bitcoin as a technology for automating monetary transactions. Instead\nof having a bureaucracy that manages the monetary ledger, Bitcoin lets\ncomputers do the job. As we\u2019ve seen, this automation leads to the profligate\nuse of electricity \u2014 energy which most of us would agree is \u2018waste\u2019. But if\nBitcoin \u2018wastes\u2019 energy on automating transactions, it follows that mainstream\nfinance \u2018wastes\u2019 energy on non-automation. It pays people to do a job that\n(conceivably) doesn\u2019t need to be done.\n\nSo which system is more wasteful. Is it Bitcoin, with its thirst for\ncomputation? Or is it mainstream finance, with its reliance on millions of\nwell-paid people?\n\nFor his part, Bitcoin\u2019s creator thought that the answer was clear. In a 2009\nemail, Satoshi argued that Bitcoin would be an \u2018order of magnitude\u2019 more\nefficient than mainstream banking:\n\n> If [Bitcoin] did grow to consume significant energy, I think it would still\n> be less wasteful than the labour and resource intensive conventional banking\n> activity it would replace. The cost would be an order of magnitude less than\n> the billions in banking fees that pay for all those brick and mortar\n> buildings, skyscrapers and junk mail credit card offers.\n\nWas Satoshi correct?\n\n### The energy budget of US finance\n\nTo judge Satoshi\u2019s claims, we need to measure the energy budget of mainstream\nfinance. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll do it.\n\nFirst, I\u2019m going to focus on the US financial system. Second, I\u2019ll assume that\nthe energy used by this system stems from the lifestyles of the people it\nemploys. Third, I\u2019ll assume that people\u2019s energy consumption is a function of\ntheir income.\n\nStarting with income, we know that US financial corporations receive about 6%\nof total American earnings. Assuming this income gets spent on energy, it\nfollows that US finance sucks up about 6% the US energy budget. That equates\nto about 7 million Terajoules of energy per year. Unsurprisingly, that\u2019s far\nmore energy than is consumed by the Bitcoin network. Figure 3 shows the\ncomparison since 2010.\n\nFigure 3: The energy appetite of US finance. While Bitcoin may be an energy\nglutton, so is US finance. This figure estimates the energy budget of US\nfinance by assuming that finance\u2019s share of US income indicates its share of\nUS energy consumption. The red curve shows the resulting estimate. As of late\n2023, US finance consumed about 10 times more energy than the Bitcoin network.\nNote that the vertical axis uses a log scale. [Sources and methods]\n\n### Disparate monetary magnitudes\n\nIf I was writing a Bitcoin puff piece, I\u2019d stop here and proclaim Bitcoin\u2019s\ngreat \u2018efficiency\u2019. But hopefully, you see why this proclamation is premature.\n\nThe problem is one of scale.\n\nMainstream US finance operates on a vastly larger scale than the Bitcoin\nnetwork. So it\u2019s unfair to directly compare the energy budgets of the two\nsystems. To make a fair comparison, we\u2019ve got to put Bitcoin and mainstream\nfinance on the same footing, which means accounting for their different\nscales.\n\nHow should we do that? Well, since we\u2019re talking about two different monetary\nsystems, the obvious approach is to sum monetary value. In the case of the\nBitcoin network, there are about 19.6 million bitcoins, each priced at roughly\n$68,000 USD. That pegs Bitcoins\u2019 market value at roughly $1.3 trillion USD.\n\nTurning to US finance, the monetary calculation is more complicated, largely\nbecause there are many different types of financial instruments. For example,\nif we take Bitcoin to be \u2018just another asset\u2019, then it makes sense to compare\nits value to the sea of US corporate assets. Looking only at US public\ncorporations, that sea is valued at roughly $50 trillion USD.\n\nAlternatively, we can treat Bitcoin as a \u2018cash asset\u2019. In this case, it makes\nsense to compare its value to the stock of US cash, most commonly measured in\nterms of the \u2018M2\u2019 stock of money. In what follows, I\u2019ll take this latter\napproach. The idea (which many people will contest) is that Bitcoin aspires to\nbe a universal currency.^4\n\nUsing the M2 stock of dollars to measure the scale of US finance, Figure 4\nshows the degree to which the mainstream financial system dwarfs the Bitcoin\nnetwork. In 2010, the chasm was enormous \u2014 roughly seven orders of magnitude.\nAnd even after a decade of explosive growth, the Bitcoin network remains\nvalued at roughly 20 times less than the M2 stock of US dollars.\n\nFigure 4: Disparate monetary magnitudes. Despite explosive growth over the\nlast decade, the dollar-value stock of Bitcoin remains about an order of\nmagnitude smaller than the M2 stock of US dollars. Note that the vertical axis\nuses a log scale. [Sources and methods]\n\n### The energy intensity of Bitcoin relative to US finance\n\nNow that we\u2019ve measured both energy and monetary value, it\u2019s time to combine\nthe two measurements. Our goal is to create a fair way to contrast Bitcoin\u2019s\nenergy appetite with that of mainstream US finance. Our vehicle for this\ncomparison will be the energy intensity of each system \u2014 the energy consumed\nper unit of circulating currency.^5\n\nTo calculate Bitcoin\u2019s energy intensity, we take its energy budget and divide\nby its market value (measured in US dollars):\n\nBitcoin energy intensity=Bitcoin market valueBitcoin energy use\n\nLikewise, for US finance, we take the energy consumed by US finance (the\nenergy required to support the lifestyles of everyone who works in finance)\nand divide by the M2 stock of US dollars. The result is the energy intensity\nof mainstream finance:\n\nUS finance energy intensity=M2 money stock of USDUS finance energy use\n\nThe caveat is that when viewed in isolation, these energy-intensity estimates\nare useless. That\u2019s because monetary value is only meaningful as a point of\ncomparison. So the final step of our analysis will be to compare Bitcoin\u2019s\nenergy intensity to that of US finance:\n\nenergy intensity ratio=US finance energy intensityBitcoin energy intensity\n\nPlugging the data into our energy-intensity ratio gives the pattern shown in\nFigure 5. Immediately, we can dismiss Satoshi\u2019s claim that Bitcoin is an\n\u2018order of magnitude\u2019 more efficient than mainstream finance. If anything, the\nopposite is true. Since 2010, the Bitcoin network has, on average, been about\n13 times more energy intensive than mainstream US finance.\n\nFigure 5: The energy intensity of Bitcoin relative to mainstream US finance.\nBy accounting for monetary scale, this figure puts the energy budget of\nBitcoin on equal footing with the energy budget of US finance. The blue curve\nshows the ratio between Bitcoin\u2019s energy intensity and US finance\u2019s energy\nintensity. I calculate Bitcoin\u2019s energy intensity by dividing Bitcoin\u2019s energy\nbudget (Figure 1) by its market value (Figure 4). Similarly, I calculate the\nenergy intensity of mainstream US finance by dividing its energy budget\n(Figure 3) by the US stock of M2 dollars (Figure 4). The shaded region\nindicates a plausible range for the energy-intensity ratio based on\nuncertainty in Bitcoin\u2019s energy use. The blue line indicates the best guess.\nNote that the vertical axis uses a log scale. [Sources and methods]\n\nLooking closely at Figure 5, we see that Bitcoin\u2019s worst period of waste was\nearly on. In 2010 \u2014 long before anyone complained that Bitcoin was wasting\nloads of energy \u2014 the network sucked up about 50 times the energy of\nmainstream finance (dollar for dollar). To put that number in context, if\nBitcoin had been scaled up to replace the circulation of US dollars, the\nBitcoin network would have use about 3 times more energy than the entire US\npopulation.^6 Outrageous.\n\n### Energy parity ... and beyond?\n\nIn Figure 5, the main story is that compared to US finance, Bitcoin has\nhistorically been significantly more energy intensive. But looking closely at\nthe evidence, there\u2019s a subplot that we shouldn\u2019t ignore.\n\nOver the last decade, it seems that the Bitcoin network has steadily closed\nthe energy gap with US finance. Instead of being 50 times more energy\nintensive (as it was in 2010), today, Bitcoin is about 4 times more energy\nintensive. That\u2019s a tenfold improvement. Intriguingly, if we project this\nimprovement into the future, we find that Bitcoin may soon reach energy-\nintensity parity with US finance.\n\nFigure 6 runs the numbers. A naive guess suggests that energy-intensity parity\nwill arrive in the early 2030s. And if the trend continued, Bitcoin would then\nstart to burn less energy (dollar for dollar) than US finance.^7 Will this\nparity actually happen? Only time will tell.\n\nFigure 6: Will Bitcoin reach energy-intensity parity with mainstream US\nfinance? If we take historical data for the Bitcoin-to-USD energy-intensity\nratio and fit it with a simple regression, we get the black line shown here.\nThat line predicts that Bitcoin will reach energy-intensity parity with\nmainstream US finance sometime in 2032. Will this parity actually happen?\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see. [Sources and methods]\n\n### Proof-of-stake: a less wasteful method for network consensus\n\nThey say that Bitcoin is \u2018digital gold\u2019. But unlike actual gold mining,\nthere\u2019s no physical reason that Bitcoin \u2018miners\u2019 must burn energy \u2018harvesting\u2019\nbitcoins. The coins themselves are conjured numbers, and the \u2018mining\u2019 process\nis simply a software algorithm. And algorithms can be changed.\n\nTo recap, the function of Bitcoin \u2018mining\u2019 is to police the monetary ledger.\nBecause Bitcoin has no governing institution, anyone is free to validate a\ntransaction and write it to the \u2018blockchain\u2019. But that freedom also means\nanyone can commit fraud. The purpose of \u2018mining\u2019 is to stop fraud by making it\nso expensive that it\u2019s impractical. To confirm a set of transactions, miners\nmust demonstrate that they\u2019ve wasted energy on a pointless computation. The\nreward for this \u2018proof-of-work\u2019 is a small amount of bitcoin.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, the proof-of-work algorithm is no model of efficiency. It\nachieves consensus by wasting loads of energy. And that\u2019s got cryptocurrency\ndesigners looking for different consensus-generating algorithms.\n\nA promising alternative is a design called \u2018proof-of-stake\u2019. Here\u2019s how it\nworks.\n\nInstead of letting users compete to validate transactions, the proof-of-stake\nalgorithm uses a lottery. When it\u2019s time to validate a \u2018block\u2019, a user is\nchosen at random from a pool of validators. The catch is that to get into this\nvalidator pool, you must put up a certain amount of currency as a \u2018stake\u2019.\nLike Bitcoin\u2019s wasted computation, the purpose of this stake is to stop fraud.\nIf a user \u2018validates\u2019 a fraudulent transaction, they risk losing their stake.\n\nBecause proof-of-stake (largely) does away with pointless calculations, it\u2019s a\nmore energy efficient design. Or at least, that\u2019s the expectation.\n\n### The energy intensity of Ethereum\n\nTo measure the energy intensity of the proof-of-stake algorithm, we\u2019ll look at\nEthereum, the second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nCreated in 2015, the Ethereum network ran for almost a decade on the proof-of-\nwork algorithm. During that time, its energy intensity was similar to Bitcoin.\nFigure 7 shows the data. From late 2015 to mid 2022, Ethereum was on average\nabout 4 times more energy intensive than mainstream US finance.\n\nThen something dramatic happened. On September 15, 2022, Ethereum switched its\ncodebase to the proof-of-stake algorithm. (In crypto circles, the event is\nknown as \u2018The Merge\u2019.) The result was a colossal drop in energy intensity. In\nFigure 7, the transition is easy to spot. Over the course of a day, Ethereum\u2019s\nenergy intensity plummeted by four orders of magnitude. So in terms of\nreducing crypto\u2019s energy demands, the proof-of-stake algorithm seems like a no\nbrainer.\n\nFigure 7: The energy intensity of Ethereum relative to mainstream US finance.\nCreated in 2015, Ethereum ran for almost a decade using the proof-of-work\nalgorithm. During that time, its energy intensity was similar to Bitcoin\u2019s \u2014\nabout four times more energy intensive than US finance. Then on September 15,\n2022, Ethereum switched to the proof-of-stake approach. The result was a\ndramatic drop in energy intensity. Note that the vertical axis uses a log\nscale. [Sources and methods]\n\n### Just the facts\n\nLooking at the evidence in Figures 5 and 7, we can conclude two things about\ncrypto.\n\nFirst, coins like Bitcoin, which are based on the proof-of-work algorithm, are\nlikely more energy intensive than mainstream finance. (But note that this\nintensity seems to be declining with time.) Second, coins like Ethereum, which\nare based on the proof-of-stake algorithm, are likely (far) less energy\nintensive than mainstream finance.\n\nSo that\u2019s what the data says. But somehow, I feel like this evidence will\nsatisfy neither the crypto critics nor the crypto advocates. And that\u2019s why in\nthe appendix, I add some obligatory speculation. But for now, let\u2019s conclude\nwith just the facts. To date, it seems clear that Satoshi\u2019s claims about\nBitcoin\u2019s superior \u2018efficiency\u2019 have not come to fruition.\n\n#### Support this blog\n\nHi folks.

And that\u2019s actually important, because purpose affects how\nwe define \u2018efficiency\u2019.\n\nFor example, the efficiency of a machine is typically measuring in terms of\nthe work output per unit of energy input. But what happens when we make the\nmachine do work that is useless? (Think of an excavator digging pointless\nholes and then filling them in.) In this case, all of the input energy gets\nwasted.\n\nReturning to crypto, I\u2019m expecting critics to argue that my energy-intensity\nestimates are silly for the same reason. Crypto, they\u2019ll observe, is the\nmonetary equivalent of pointless hole digging. It\u2019s purpose isn\u2019t to\nfacilitate commerce. Instead, it\u2019s a beast of socially-useless speculation.\n\nWhile I\u2019m sympathetic to this argument, I think the problem of crypto\nspeculation tends to get overplayed. In particular, it ignores the fact that\nspeculation plagues all forms of money.\n\nWhen critics look a Bitcoin, they see an asset that is too volatile to be\n\u2018real\u2019 money. But a quick look at international money markets shows that\n\u2018real\u2019 (fiat) money can also be highly volatile. Figure 8 paints the picture.\n\nHere, the blue curve shows the spread of exchange-rate volatility among the\nworld\u2019s currencies (when pegged against the US dollar). When we put Ether and\nBitcoin on this international scale, we find that they\u2019re on the high end of\ncurrency volatility. But they\u2019re certainly not off the chart. In other words,\non the scale of actually existing money, there is nothing \u2018abnormal\u2019 about\ncrypto volatility. Hence there is nothing \u2018abnormal\u2019 about crypto speculation.\n\nFigure 8: Cryptocurrency volatility in an international context. This figure\nmeasure the exchange-rate volatility of different currencies when pegged\nagainst the US dollar. (I\u2019ve measure volatility by plugging the exchange rate\nannual time series into the coefficient of variation.) The blue curve shows\nthe distribution of volatility among national currencies. The vertical lines\nshow the historical volatility of Ether and Bitcoin. Note that the horizontal\naxis uses a log scale. [Sources and methods]\n\nStill, the critics are right to pass judgment on crypto as a relatively\nvolatile asset. But where I disagree with the critics is that this volatility\nmakes crypto forever unsuitable for commerce. The reality is that the\ndifference between a volatile \u2018asset\u2019 and stable form of \u2018money\u2019 is simple:\nit\u2019s a function of hegemony.\n\nWhat makes a currency stable is its dominance. When most prices are\ndenominated in a particular unit, that unit loses its speculative appeal. In\nother words, if Bitcoin became the world\u2019s dominant asset, it would behave\nexactly like cash \u2014 stable and boring.^8 In short, crypto\u2019s \u2018usefulness\u2019 as a\nstable form of money depends on its ability to gain global dominance as a\nmedium of exchange.\n\n### Hurdles to a crypto-dominated future\n\nThinking about a crypto-dominated future, there are many hurdles to it\nactually happening. Here\u2019s a short list.\n\n#### Lack of scalability\n\nDespite being built on stupendous computational power, crypto networks are\ntypically quite slow at processing transactions. For example, the Bitcoin\nnetwork maxes out at roughly 4 transactions per second.^9 And the Ethereum\nnetwork can handle about 20 transactions per second. In contrast, global\ncredit-card networks process about 10,000 transactions per second.^10 So as\nthey currently stand, the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks can\u2019t scale to meet\nthe needs of global commerce.\n\nInterestingly, the cause of this high latency is part of the network design.\nThe idea is that when choosing between security, decentralization, and\nscalability, you can only have two of the three. So networks like Bitcoin and\nEthereum choose security and decentralization, but sacrifice scalability.\nCredit card networks, on the other hand, achieve scalability by choosing\ncentralization and remarkably little security.\n\n(In the age of online shopping, the security principle of credit cards is\neffectively \u201chere is my secret number, please don\u2019t use it unless I ask you\nto\u201d.)\n\nOf course, crypto advocates are aware that their networks need to be faster.\nTo make that happen, one option is to build so-called \u2018layer 2\u2019 systems on top\nof cryptocurrency networks. For example, the Lightning network is a layer 2\nsystem that runs on top of the Bitcoin network.\n\nIn conceptual terms, layer 2 systems work much like a credit account. For\nexample, if Business A deals repeatedly with Business B, Business B will\ntypically offer Business A a line of credit. The idea is that instead of using\ncash to clear every transaction, Business B keeps track of the net value of\nBusiness A\u2019s purchases. Then every month, Business B sends a bill to settle\nthe account.\n\nIn a similar vein, layer 2 systems allow crypto users to setup \u2018channels\u2019 in\nwhich transactions can occur off the blockchain. When users decide to close a\nchannel, the net value of all transaction is then settled on the main ledger.\nBy grouping many transactions under a single blockchain settlement, layer 2\nsystems can vastly increase the capacity of crypto networks. For example, the\nLightning network claims to be capable of handling millions of transactions\nper second.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether layer 2 systems will achieve widespread\nadoption. To date, of the roughly 19 million bitcoin in existence, only 5000\ncirculate in the Lightning network.\n\n#### Government power\n\nSetting aside the (current) technical shortcomings of crypto networks, I think\nthe main hurdles to a crypto-dominated future are institutional. Let\u2019s start\nwith government.\n\nIf crypto become the dominant form of money, it follows that governments would\nlose sovereign control of their national currencies. Now, we can debate\nwhether this loss would be good or bad. But I think we can agree that it\nrepresents a significant loss of power \u2014 a loss that governments would be\nreticent to accept. So in my mind, the route to crypto dominance requires the\ndemise of (or significant diminution of) the nation state.\n\n#### Bank power\n\nOther than governments, the institutions most invested in the existing\nfinancial system are undoubtedly banks. And that\u2019s because they have the power\nto create money by issuing credit.\n\nIn a crypto-dominated world, I find it unlikely that banks would simply\nrelinquish this power. Instead, they\u2019d likely start issuing crypto-based\ncredit. But once this crypto credit started flowing, the credit itself would\nbecome the dominant currency.\n\nThe situation would be similar to the Bretton Woods system, in which bank\nnotes were theoretically backed by gold reserves. But the \u2018backing\u2019 was\ncompletely notional. The gold itself didn\u2019t circulate and was almost never\nused as a medium of exchange. As Nixon realized, it was just as easy to cut\nthe cord and admit that money was backed by nothing but social will.\n\nIn short, if banks retain the power to issue credit, I see nothing to gain\nfrom a crypto future, and no feasible path to actual crypto dominance.\n\n### Sources and methods\n\nCover image: the bitcoin-dollar-scale image is from the Wikimedia commons. The\nsmokestack image is from Grigoriy via Pexels.\n\n#### Bitcoin energy use\n\nEstimates for Bitcoin energy use are from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity\nConsumption Index. The estimates are constructed by taking the hashing rate in\nthe Bitcoin network (which is publicly available) and multiplying it by the\nhashing efficiency (i.e. hash per Watt) of available technology.\n\nThis hashing efficiency is the main unknown. To estimate it, the CBECI looks\nat the available Bitcoin mining technology (technology which changes over\ntime). Here\u2019s the gist of their calculation.\n\nIf all miners used the most efficient technology on the market, we get a lower\nbound for the energy used by the Bitcoin network. If all miners used the least\nefficient technology that was still profitable (at an assumed electricity\nprice of 5 cents per kWh), we get an upper bound for Bitcoin energy use. The\nbest guess is somewhere in the middle of this range.\n\nNote that the CBECI reports Bitcoin\u2019s electricity use. To compare this\nelectricity use to US primary energy consumption, I convert it to a primary-\nenergy equivalent. See the conversion notes here.\n\n#### Bitcoin market value\n\nData for the number of Bitcoins in circulation is from blockchain.com.\n\nData for Bitcoin price comes from two sources:\n\n  * 2009-01-03 to 2014-09-14: blockchain.com.\n  * 2014-09-17 to present: downloaded using the R tidyquant package\n\n#### Ethereum energy use\n\nEstimates for Ethereum electricity use come from the Cambridge Bitcoin\nElectricity Consumption Index. Data for Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work period live\nhere. Data for its proof-of-stake period live here.\n\nFor the proof-of-work period, the CBECI uses the same estimation methods as\nfor Bitcoin. (It multiplies the hash rate by the estimated hashing efficiency\nof existing technology.)\n\nFor the proof-of-work period, the CBECI counts Ethereum nodes, and then\nestimates the power draw of an average node. These power estimates come from\nthe Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute\u2019s 2022 report \u2018The Merge\u2019.\n\nNote that the CBECI reports Ethereum electricity use. To compare this\nelectricity use to US primary energy consumption, I convert it to a primary-\nenergy equivalent. See the conversion notes here.\n\n#### Ethereum market value\n\nData for Ethereum\u2019s total value (and the price of Ether) is from\ncoingecko.com.\n\n#### Exchange rates\n\nData for historical exchange rates (Figure 8) is from the World Bank, series\nPA.NUS.FCRF.\n\n#### Energy used by US finance\n\nEstimates for the energy used by US finance work as follows:\n\n  1. Calculate finance\u2019s share of US income. I do that by dividing the value added of US financial corporations (FRED series A454RC1Q027SBEA) by US nominal GDP (FRED series GDP).\n  2. Multiply finance\u2019s share of US income by US total energy consumption. Energy consumption is from the Energy Information Agency, series TETCBUS (total primary energy consumption)\n\n#### Converting electricity to primary energy equivalent\n\nDespite the growth of renewable energy sources, most electricity is still\nproduced by burning fossil fuels (or what statistical agencies call \u2018primary\nenergy sources\u2019.)\n\nNow, because thermo-electric power plants are not 100% efficient, more fossil-\nfuel energy goes into these plants than comes out in electricity. As a result,\nit\u2019s not fair to compare electricity consumption directly to fossil-fuel use \u2014\nit\u2019s an apples-oranges comparison.\n\nTurning to Bitcoin, its energy consumption is reported in terms of electricity\nuse. But we want to compare this to the primary energy (read fossil fuels)\nused by US finance. To make the comparison, we need to convert electricity\ninto a primary-energy equivalent.\n\nI do that using US data from the Energy Information Agency. I take data for\nthe total total primary energy consumed by the electric power sector (series\nTXEIBUS) and divide it by the net electricity generation of the electric power\nsector (series ELEGPUS). The result is the primary energy intensity of US\nelectricity. I then multiply Bitcoin electricity use by this primary energy\nintensity. The result is Bitcoin energy use expressed as a primary energy\nequivalent.\n\nNote: due to changing energy mixes, the primary energy intensity of US\nelectricity is a moving target, as shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9: The primary energy intensity of US electricity. Because most\nelectricity comes from fossil fuels, more \u2018primary energy\u2019 goes into the\ngeneration process than comes out as electricity. This figure shows the\nevolving primary energy intensity of US electricity.\n\n### Notes\n\n  1. Fun fact: The US Secret Service \u2014 today, known mostly for protecting high-ranking politicians \u2014 was created in 1865 for the express purpose of fighting counterfeit US currency.\u21a9\ufe0e\n  2. According to Timothy Gutowski and colleagues, each kilogram of gold takes about 100,000 MJ to produce. At today\u2019s gold prices of roughly $67,000 per kilogram, we get a gold energy intensity of about 1.5 MJ per dollar.\u21a9\ufe0e\n  3. A common misconception is that Bitcoin mining involves solving \u2018complex\u2019 math problems. But actually, it\u2019s more like finding a needle in a haystack. Bitcoin mining involves solving a \u2018hash\u2019 problem, the details of which are not important. What matters is that the only viable method for getting the solution is through trial and error.\n\nOn that front, the hash problem is similar to finding prime factors. If you\nwant to reduce a number to its prime factors (i.e. 20=2\u00d72\u00d75), there is only\none known method: trial and error. You start with the smallest prime, 2, and\nsee if it\u2019s a divisor of n. If it is, you take the resulting quotient and\nrepeat the process. If 2 isn\u2019t a divisor, you move to the next prime and try\nagain. Once the quotient is itself a prime number, you\u2019re finished.\n\nIf n is a very large number, finding its prime factors takes significant\ncomputer resources. But once the solution has been found, it\u2019s trivial to\nverify. You simply take the prime factors and confirm that they multiply to n.\n\nWith Bitcoin hashes, the same principle applies. The hash problem is intensive\nto solve but easy to verify. The result is that the network can easily reach a\nconsensus that a miner has done the \u2018work\u2019 required to validate a block of\ntransactions.\u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  4. Likely because of its ubiquity, \u2018money\u2019 is perhaps the most misunderstood of all social conventions. For that reason, there\u2019s a heated debate about whether bitcoin even counts as \u2018money\u2019. I find this debate utterly boring.\n\nI think Steve Roth gets it right when he defines money as a \u2018fixed-priced\nasset\u2019 \u2014 an asset whose price doesn\u2019t change because it is always pegged\nagainst itself. What\u2019s nice about this definition is that it\u2019s delightfully\ncircular. And the same is true of \u2018money\u2019. An asset becomes \u2018money\u2019 when it is\nso ubiquitous that it is compared to itself. It follows that \u2018money\u2019 is simply\nthe most dominant form of asset \u2014 whatever that may be.\u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  5. I\u2019m anticipating that some people will interpret my energy intensity ratio as a measure of the energy needed to \u2018create\u2019 money. But that is not what it means. As I\u2019ve taken pains to explain, money is just a number, and numbers are free. The energy put into financial systems is driven by the need to keep numbers scarce. Enforcing accounting rules is a costly business.\u21a9\ufe0e\n  6. In 2010, US finance accrued about 6% of US income. Assuming that this income got burned on energy, it follows that US finance used about 6% of US energy. Now assume we replace all dollars with bitcoin. In 2010, the Bitcoin network was about 50 times more energy intensive than mainstream finance. It follows that the bitcoin replacement would increase finances\u2019 energy demands by fifty-fold, to a total of 300% of US total energy consumption.\u21a9\ufe0e\n  7. What\u2019s driving Bitcoin\u2019s decreasing energy intensity? Two things. First, the technology used for hashing has grown steadily more efficient. Second, the price of Bitcoin (in US dollars) has grown rapidly, which means that each Bitcoin transaction pushes around more dollar value.\n\nThis second pattern points to a feature of Bitcoin than many critics miss.\nIt\u2019s build-in waste is tied to the transaction of bitcoin. But there is\nnothing that restricts what this transaction is worth in dollars. In other\nwords, if a single bitcoin transaction pushes around a few dollars worth of\nvalue, then the exchange is horribly inefficient. But if the same transaction\npushes around a billions dollars of value, it becomes highly efficient.\u21a9\ufe0e\n\n  8. The irony here is that many crypto bros want Bitcoin to be both a speculative asset and the world\u2019s dominant currency. Sorry bros, but you can\u2019t have both.\u21a9\ufe0e\n  9. Since 2017, the number of Bitcoin transactions has hovered around 10 million per month. That equates to about 3.8 transactions per second\u21a9\ufe0e\n  10. According to cardrates.com, there were about 368.92 billion credit-card transactions in 2018. That equates to about 11,700 transactions per second.\u21a9\ufe0e\n\n### Further reading\n\nNakamoto, S.

I would\nexpect energy consumption to roughly scale with the amount of transactions, or\nat least with the amount of money being exchanged in a certain timeframe. Why\nare you instead using the total amount of money available to normalize the\nenergy consumption? Like I can understand that even if you are keeping your\nmoney put in a bank account, the bank is going to expend energy keeping the\nservers alive, and maybe applying interest and such, but the vast majority of\nenergy would still be transactions, wouldn\u2019t it?\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n     * David A says:\n\nMarch 22, 2024 at 10:07 am\n\nI had the same question as David above: the energy consumption of the\ntraditional finance system is \u2013 in a first approximation \u2013 fairly independent\nof the number of transactions.

(I got data for the M3 stock, which\nwasn\u2019t much different than the data for the M2 stock.) And I also thought\nbriefly about summing up all assets. But this leads to philosophical problems.\n\nFor one thing, what does \u2018finance\u2019 do? Does it \u2018create\u2019 capitalization? Or is\nfinance a middleman, greasing the wheels of capital mobility. I\u2019d opt for the\nlatter definition. So doing \u2018finance\u2019 is the task of swapping assets, a job\ntypically done with dollars. If Bitcoin became the dominant currency, the task\nof swapping assets would be done with Bitcoin. So in my mind, it doesn\u2019t make\nsense to get the value of non-cash assets involved. That said, boundary issues\nare always open for debate.\n\nLoading...\n\n       * Blair Fix says:\n\nMarch 22, 2024 at 11:11 am\n\nBitcoin clearly has a transaction scale problem, as you mention.
