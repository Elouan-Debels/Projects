I'll have up some\ninteresting metrics soon using Fedora 40 while for this initial article is a\nlook at the KDE Plasma 6.0 gaming performance between the Wayland and X11\nsessions atop KDE Neon. Then similarly are the results for GNOME Shell with\nits X11 and Wayland sessions.\n\nUsing the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS based KDE Neon I ran some benchmarks looking at the\nopen-source Radeon Linux gaming performance atop this distribution that is\nalready shipping the latest KDE Plasma 6.0 / KDE Frameworks 6 / KDE App\npackages. From there I ran a variety of gaming benchmarks using the kdefault\nKDE Plasma 6.0 Wayland session for the (X)Wayland gaming performance and\nrepeating the tests as well under the alternative X11 session.\n\nFor getting some GNOME reference figures I repeated the same tests using GNOME\nShell X11 / Wayland atop the same KDE Neon package set. It's worth noting\nthough in the KDE Neon archive from Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is the GNOME Shell 42.9\npackages compared to the very latest GNOME 46 upstream release. Thus for the\nupcoming Fedora 40 comparison it will be more interesting for looking at the\nLinux gaming performance when maintaining the very latest packages for each.\n\nThe same AMD Ryzen 9 7950X system with AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics on\nLinux 6.5 + Mesa 23.2 was used for this KDE Plasma 6.0 focused gaming\nbenchmarks.\n\n51 Comments - Next Page\n\nTweet\n\nPage: 1 2 3 4 Next Page\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThe Performance & Power Improvement Of Steam Deck OLED's 6nm APU\n\nTweaking SteamOS For Better Steam Deck Performance\n\nNVIDIA GeForce vs. AMD Radeon Linux Gaming Performance For August 2023\n\nWindows 11 vs. Linux Gaming Performance On The ASUS ROG Ally\n\nGNOME Wayland vs. X.Org Performance For Radeon & NVIDIA Gaming On Ubuntu 23.04\n\nNVIDIA R530 vs. AMD Linux 6.3 + Mesa 23.2-dev Gaming Performance\n\nLatest Linux News\n\nOpenSSL 3.3 Released With Many Additions For QUIC, CPU Performance\nOptimizations\n\nNouveau/NVK Driver Lands NIL Library Rewrite In Rust For Mesa 24.1\n\nExplicit GPU Synchronization Merged For XWayland\n\nLinux Mint Aims For More Reliable & Faster Repository Access\n\nCanonical Announces Ubuntu Pro For Devices\n\nAMD Announces Versal Gen 2 Adaptive SoCs - AI Focused & Newer Arm Cores\n\nFESCo Approves The Fedora 41 Switch To DNF5\n\nLinux 6.10 AES-XTS For Disk/File Encryption As Much As ~155% Faster For AMD\nZen 4 CPUs\n\nKDAB Working On Embedding Servo Web Engine Within Qt\n\nRISC-V Adding Kernel-Mode FPU For Linux 6.10 To Enable Recent AMD Display\nSupport\n\nRADV Vulkan Driver Enables EXT_shader_object By Default With Mesa 24.1\n\nRaspberry Pi OS Now Shipping With Vulkan Support By Default\n\nShow Your Support, Go Premium\n\nPhoronix Premium allows ad-free access to the site, multi-page articles on a\nsingle page, and other features while supporting this site's continued\noperations.\n\nLatest Featured Articles\n\nAMD Radeon Linux Gaming Performance At Parity Between KDE Plasma 6.0 X11 vs.\nWayland\n\nIntel Xeon Max Sees Some Performance Gains For OpenVINO & ONNX With Linux 6.9\n\nCrucial T705 PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSD On Linux\n\nTUXEDO Pulse 14 Gen 3 Continues Running Well As A Powerful AMD Ryzen 7 Linux\nLaptop\n\nLinux 6.9 Drives AMD 4th Gen EPYC Performance Even Higher For Some Workloads\n\nSupport Phoronix\n\nThe mission at Phoronix since 2004 has centered around enriching the Linux\nhardware experience.
