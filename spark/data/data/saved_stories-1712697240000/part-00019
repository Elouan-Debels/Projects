It\u2019s associated with\na variety of issues, such as worse academic performance, worse employment and\nfinancial status, worse emotional wellbeing, worse mental health, worse\nphysical health, and delay in getting treatment for one\u2019s issues.\n\nThere\u2019s a genetic component to procrastination, which has important\nimplications for understanding who procrastinates, why they do so, and what\ncan be done about it. As such, in the following article you will learn more\nabout the genetics of procrastination, and see what its implications are in\npractice.\n\nContents\n\nToggle\n\n## The genetic heritability of procrastination\n\nResearch shows that there is a significant genetic component to\nprocrastination, to traits that are associated with procrastination (e.g.,\nself-control), and to conditions that can lead to procrastination (e.g.,\nADHD). This means that the ways people procrastinate and their reasons for\nprocrastinating can be influenced by the genes that they inherit from their\nparents.\n\nThe key evidence for the heritability of procrastination comes from studies on\ntwins, which found that procrastination is moderately heritable. The exact\nestimates for this heritability vary across studies, based on factors such as\nthe sample and measures that the researchers used.\n\nThe best-known study on the topic found that almost half (46%) of the variance\nin procrastination can be attributed to genetic factors, as opposed to\nenvironmental ones. However, other studies, including by the same researchers,\nfound lower estimates of heritability, such as 40%, 28%, and 22%. As these\nresearchers note, the high estimate (46%) is likely in part due to the\ntendency of study participants to self-report their behavior in a biased\nmanner, to make their behavior appear more socially desirable; when this is\ncontrolled for, the estimated heritability drops.\n\nBased on this, it\u2019s reasonable to estimate, from a practical perspective, that\napproximately a third (i.e., ~33%) of the variance in procrastination can\ngenerally be attributed to genetic causes, or at least around a quarter of the\nvariance (~25%). For comparison, this isn\u2019t far from twin-based heritability\nestimates for depression (~35%) and anxiety disorders (~30%\u201350%, depending on\nthe type of disorder), but is much lower than for ADHD (~80%).\n\nThe findings on the heritability of procrastination align with findings on the\nrole of genetics when it comes to associated traits, which are strongly\nassociated with the tendency to procrastinate, such as self-control and\nconscientiousness. Similarly, there\u2019s also a genetic component to some\nconditions\u2014such as ADHD, depression, and anxiety\u2014that can cause people to\nprocrastinate.\n\nIn addition, the genetic components of procrastination are also strongly\ncorrelated with the genetic components of associated traits and issues, such\nas impulsivity, executive functions, and goal-management failure, as well as\nwith their phenotypic manifestation. This suggests that these factors may be\npartially responsible for people\u2019s procrastination, something that is\nsupported by behavioral research. Furthermore, other types of factors, such as\nage and dopamine levels, may influence people\u2019s procrastination, and some of\nthese factors, such as gender, may moderate the influence of genetic factors.\n\nThere are many caveats about all these findings, such as that, as noted above,\nthey\u2019re influenced by the specific sample and measures that researchers used.\nThis means, for example, that future genome-wide association studies on the\ntopic may find different estimates for the genetic heritability of\nprocrastination than the twin-based estimates.\n\nAccordingly, there are many remaining questions regarding the genetics of\nprocrastination, such as exactly how much of people\u2019s procrastination is\nattributable to genetic factors. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence to\nshow that there is a significant genetic component to procrastination, even if\nwe don\u2019t fully understand it and its magnitude yet.\n\n## The role of environment in procrastination\n\nSimilarly to genetics, people\u2019s environment can influence their\nprocrastination, in terms of factors such as how and why they procrastinate.\nIt can do so in both negative and positive ways, and in both the short term\n(when it comes to their state procrastination) and the long term (when it\ncomes to their trait procrastination). For example:\n\n  * If a student receives unnecessarily harsh criticism on an initial essay draft, even though they worked hard on it, this could cause them to delay working on the essay, in order to delay dealing with the unpleasant criticism.\n  * If a student consistently receives unnecessarily harsh criticism for years, for instance because they have undiagnosed ADHD, this could cause them to delay working on academic assignments, in order to delay dealing with the unpleasant emotions that are associated with those assignments.\n  * If a student receives encouragement for working hard on an initial essay draft, even though they made mistakes, this could motivate them to work on the essay on time.\n  * If a student consistently receives encouragement for years for working hard even if they make mistakes, this could improve their self-efficacy, which can make them less likely to delay working on academic assignments that they\u2019re given.\n\nSome environmental factors are outside of a person\u2019s control, such as the\nstyle of parenting that they experienced as a child, or the general family\nenvironment that they grew up in. Other environmental factors are\nsometimes\u2014but not always\u2014within a person\u2019s control, at least partially, such\nas who they socialize with, what outcomes their work can lead to, how\norganized are the systems (e.g., job or school) that they\u2019re in, what types of\ndeadlines they have, and what type of time-management systems they use.\n\nEnvironmental factors can influence people\u2019s procrastination through various\nmechanisms. For example, a distracting environment can make people more likely\nto procrastinate by making it harder for them to concentrate on their work or\nby tempting them to engage in other activities.\n\nIn addition, environmental and genetic influences can interact in various\nways. For example, someone who is genetically prone to impulsivity will be\nmore likely to procrastinate due to temptations in their environment than\nsomeone whose genes make them less impulsive. Furthermore, the environment can\nalso play a role when it comes to epigenetics, by influencing the way a\nperson\u2019s genes are expressed, which can play a role, for example, when it\ncomes to various neurobiological mechanisms involved in procrastination.\n\nAs with genetics, the exact way in which a person\u2019s environment influences\ntheir procrastination is unclear, and there is much we do not yet know for\ncertain. Nevertheless, it is clear that environmental factors have a\nsignificant effect on people\u2019s procrastination, and that some of these factors\nare within people\u2019s control, at least partially, while others aren\u2019t.\n\n## Implications of the genetics of procrastination\n\nThe genetic heritability of procrastination means that some people are more\nlikely than others to procrastinate due to their genes, or are more likely to\nprocrastinate in certain ways and for certain reasons. However, there are two\nimportant caveats about this.\n\nFirst, the influence of genetics varies based on many factors, such as the\npopulation that a person belongs to, and the specific causes of that person\u2019s\nprocrastination (e.g., ADHD vs. depression).\n\nSecond, people\u2019s genes (sometimes referred to in this context as their nature)\nare responsible for only a portion of their procrastination, as their\nenvironment (sometimes referred to in this context as nurture) also plays a\nsubstantial role. This means, for example, that some people procrastinate a\nlot despite being genetically predisposed not to, and conversely, that other\npeople don\u2019t procrastinate despite being genetically predisposed to doing so.\n\nAs such, although people\u2019s genetics influences their procrastination, it\u2019s not\nthe only factor that does so. This means that even people who are predisposed\nto procrastination can generally overcome their procrastination or at least\nreduce it, and this is supported by behavioral research which shows that it\u2019s\npossible to reduce procrastination using various interventions, such as\ncognitive behavioral therapy.\n\n## How to stop procrastinating\n\nAs discussed above, even though there\u2019s a genetic component to\nprocrastination, it has only a partial influence on people\u2019s tendency to\nprocrastinate. This means that you can likely reduce or overcome\nprocrastination, by using anti-procrastination techniques such as the\nfollowing:\n\n  * Set concrete goals. For example, instead of a vague goal, such as \u201cwork on this paper next week\u201d, set a concrete goal, such as \u201cstarting Monday, work on this paper each day for two hours in the afternoon, and have a first draft ready by Friday\u201d.\n  * Break your work into small and manageable steps. For example, if you have a large project that feels overwhelming, such as writing a research paper, you can break it down into a series of small steps, such as creating an outline, finding relevant resources, and writing the introduction.\n  * Start with a tiny step. For example, you commit to writing only a single sentence or exercising for only 2 minutes, while giving yourself permission to stop after taking that tiny first step, to reduce the pressure associated with getting started.\n  * Give yourself permission to make mistakes. For example, if you\u2019re writing a paper, accept that your work won\u2019t be perfect, especially when it comes to the first draft.\n  * Figure out what you\u2019re afraid of, and address your fears. For example, if you realize that you\u2019re afraid of getting negative feedback from someone who isn\u2019t really important, you can tell yourself that their feedback doesn\u2019t matter.\n  * Prepare for future contingencies. For example, figure out which distractions might tempt you to procrastinate, and plan how you will deal with them.\n  * Switch between tasks. For example, if you\u2019re stuck on a task and can\u2019t make progress, switch to a different task until you\u2019re ready to go back to the first one.\n  * Schedule your work according to your productivity cycles. For example, if you find it easier to concentrate on creative tasks in the morning, then you should schedule such tasks for that time period as much as possible.\n  * Improve your work environment. For example, if your current work environment has a lot of irritating background noise, get noise-canceling headphones or go somewhere quieter.\n  * Improve your social-support network. For example, you can find a role model to imitate or an authority figure to hold you accountable, or you can associate with people who motivate you to make progress while minimizing your contact with people who make you feel stressed.\n  * Get enough rest. For example, if you need to work hard on tasks that require deep concentration, make sure to take enough breaks that you don\u2019t get burnt out. To encourage yourself to do this, you can remind yourself that even if getting rest can reduce your productivity in the short term, it will often be much better for you in the long term, both in terms of your productivity and in terms of your wellbeing.\n  * Develop self-efficacy. Specifically, this is your belief in your ability to perform the actions needed to achieve your goals. You can develop it in various ways, such as identifying the strategies that you can use to achieve your goals, and then thinking about how you can execute those strategies successfully.\n  * Forgive yourself for past procrastination. For example, if you need to get started on a task that you\u2019ve been postponing for a long time, you can say \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have postponed this task in the first place, but that\u2019s in the past, and what\u2019s important now is to move on and just get this done\u201d.\n  * Develop self-compassion. Specifically, you should develop the three components of self-compassion: self-kindness, which involves being nice to yourself, common humanity, which involves recognizing that everyone experiences challenges, and mindfulness, which involves accepting your emotions in a non-judgmental manner.\n  * Acknowledge and reward your progress. For example, you can treat yourself to some pleasant treat once you\u2019ve managed to achieve your study goals for a week in a row.\n\nIn addition, when figuring out which anti-procrastination techniques to use,\nit can help to first identify the causes of your procrastination, since this\nwill help you find the techniques that are most relevant in your particular\nsituation. This is because, for example, if you procrastinate due to\nunderlying anxiety, then your solution will likely be different than if you\nprocrastinate due to ADHD, or if you procrastinate due to abstract goals.\n\nCategories Procrastination Articles\n\nBy Itamar Shatz, PhD\n\nGet research-based tips on how to overcome procrastination.\n\n## Key pages\n\n  * Home\n  * Resources\n  * Start here\n\n## More\n\n  * Newsletter\n  * Coaching\n\nAbout | Contact | Privacy | Terms | \u00a9 2024 Solving Procrastination\n\nFacebookTwitterShare\n\nFacebookTwitterShare\n\n\u2713\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nAddToAny\n\nMore...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
