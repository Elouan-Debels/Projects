Enter a prompt (required), or use the default prompt provided by the model\nand modify it as needed.\n\n2\\. Input a negative prompt (optional) to exclude unwanted details from the\nimage.\n\n3\\. Choose a Model from our vast selection of styles, such as anime,\ntraditional, cartoon, and more.\n\n4\\. Set the resolution; you can adjust the size of your image within a range\nof 256px to 2048px.\n\n5\\. Step setting (optional) increases the number of steps to produce more\nrefined details in the generated image, with 20 steps being optimal.\n\n6\\. Image Num setting (optional) allows you to customize the number of images\ngenerated at once, supporting 1 to 6 images. Note that generating more images\nat once will require more time.\n\n7\\. Guidance Scale setting (optional) adjusts the fidelity to the prompts: a\nhigher number indicates higher fidelity to the provided prompts, thus limiting\nthe AI's creative freedom. The recommended range is 7 to 12.\n\n8\\. Seed setting (optional) enables repeatable image generation, parameter\nexperimentation, and prompt variations. A seed value of -1 indicates\nrandomness. By selecting a fixed value within the range of 0 to infinity, you\ncan maintain basic consistency across multiple image generations with only\nminor variations in details.\n\n## Future Development of Girl Generator\n\nGirl Generator is still a work in progress, including features, page layout,\nand image storage, among others. I will continue to develop and update it, and\nI appreciate your encouragement and support!\n\n1\\. Website features: Currently, all generated images are public, so it's\nimportant to add registration, login, and private image features.\n\n2\\. Page layout: It's undeniable that the current website layout and style are\nnot visually appealing. I need to study page design and user experience to\nenhance the visual quality of Girl Generator. If you have any suggestions,\nplease contact me.\n\n3\\. Image storage: At present, images can only be stored for up to 7 days. In\nthe future, storage will be moved to CloudFlare to ensure the security of your\ngenerated images and provide permanent storage.\n\n4\\.
