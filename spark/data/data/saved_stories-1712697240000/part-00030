Thus, effective\nstrategies to suppress or neutralise anger have been examined. This study\nshows that physical disposal of a piece of paper containing one\u2019s written\nthoughts on the cause of a provocative event neutralises anger, while holding\nthe paper did not. In this study, participants wrote brief opinions about\nsocial problems and received a handwritten, insulting comment consisting of\nlow evaluations about their composition from a confederate. Then, the\nparticipants wrote the cause and their thoughts about the provocative event.\nHalf of the participants (disposal group) disposed of the paper in the trash\ncan (Experiment 1) or in the shredder (Experiment 2), while the other half\n(retention group) kept it in a file on the desk. All the participants showed\nan increased subjective rating of anger after receiving the insulting\nfeedback. However, the subjective anger for the disposal group decreased as\nlow as the baseline period, while that of the retention group was still higher\nthan that in the baseline period in both experiments. We propose this method\nas a powerful and simple way to eliminate anger.\n\n## Experiment 1\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe need to control anger has been of importance for a long time in human\nsocieties, as inferred by a philosopher in Imperium Romanum who had already\nexplored how to cease being angry^1. However, it can still be challenging to\nsuppress anger effectively. Frequent, unregulated anger often leads to\nviolence towards children^2, which has become an increasingly prevalent issue.\nOne study found that the global estimate for children experiencing any form of\nviolence (physical, sexual, emotional, or a combination) in the past year is\none billion children aged 2\u201317 years^3. The number of child abuse cases in\nJapan has reportedly doubled in the past decade^4. Children learn about\nappropriate emotional expression and behaviour from their parents^5, and\nchildren who have been maltreated may lack the opportunity to learn how to\nregulate anger. Consequently, these maltreated children may have difficulty\ncontrolling their own anger^6, recognising anger in others^7, and tend to\nexhibit externalizing behaviour problems^8. These studies suggest that\nparental anger regulation issues negatively affect children\u2019s emotional\ncompetence. Therefore, an effective way of reducing anger has been examined\nthroughout the years^9.\n\nHowever, simply attempting to suppress anger is usually not effective^10. Both\ncognitive reappraisal and distraction (i.e., thinking about something other\nthan provocative comments) could reduce anger; however, distraction could\nsuppress anger only for a transient period of time^11. Cognitive reappraisal\nrefers to the reinterpretation or modification of the meaning of an unpleasant\nsituation. Although reappraisal is considered as an effective way to reduce\nanger^12, it requires greater cognitive effort^13,14. Therefore, reappraisal\nunder stressful situations which require cognitive load was not found to be\neffective in reducing anger as compared to non-stressful situations^15. Self-\ndistancing, which may be responsible for the anger-reducing effect of\nreappraisal^12 is also considered as an effective way to reduce anger.\nNevertheless, self-distancing or reflection on one\u2019s provocation from a\ndistance is often not feasible, especially in the heat of the moment^13.\n\nFailure to reduce anger can lead an individual to think about a provocative\nevent repeatedly. Such ruminations are often produced in a self-immersed,\nexperiential manner^16. Self-immersed experiential rumination can lead to\nreliving past provocative events^17, thus maintaining or even increasing\nsubjective anger and vascular responses^18.\n\nHowever, among the types of ruminations, writing down a provocation event does\nnot always maintain or increase anger; instead, anger is suppressed depending\non the way of writing. For instance, anger was suppressed when participants\nwrote down the anger-inducing event in a detached, informational, \u2018cool\u2019\nmanner. However, their anger was not suppressed (and was maintained or even\nincreased) when they failed to write down the event in an analytical manner,\nand wrote it down in a \u2018hot\u2019 (emotional) manner^12. Somewhat relevant here is\nthe expressive writing technique^19, which is frequently used in emotion-\nfocused psychotherapy treatment^20. It is believed to be effective in\nsuppressing anger in clinical settings. However, only one experimental study\nusing this technique has been conducted, wherein it was found that there was a\nsignificant likelihood of reduced anger when sentences about the emotion were\nwritten in the past tense^21. These studies suggest that anger may be\nsuccessfully suppressed if individuals are able to separate their internal\nexperience of provocative events from their sense of self^22. Healy et al.^23\nreported that negative self-referential statements (\u2018my life is pointless\u2019),\nwhen presented in a defused format (\u2018I am having a thought that my life is\npointless\u2019), could decrease the emotional discomfort related to that\nstatement.\n\nThese previous studies emphasised the cognitive processes (such as goals or\nvaluations) that occur almost entirely inside individuals\u2019 heads^24. However,\nif we look at the literature more broadly, studies on emotion regulation (a\nsituated cognitive approach) have demonstrated successful emotion control\nthrough dynamic interplay between the person and the situation^24,25. From\nthis situated cognition perspective, people perceive their environment in\nterms of the possibilities for the kinds of actions that they would pursue.\nThese functional features of the environment (affordances) do not solely exist\ninside an individual\u2019s mind but instead have a physical reality that exists in\nthe individual\u2019s relationship with the environment. For instance, people\nfrequently use physical substances to modify their moods. People may take a\nhot shower when they feel lonely^26,27 or hold a teddy bear when they feel\nafraid^28. Such access to physical objects can significantly modify\nindividuals\u2019 ability to manage their emotions.\n\nIn this study, we developed a new anger reduction strategy inspired by the\nsituated cognition approach to emotion regulation^24. Relevant to this\napproach, the notion of a grounded procedure of separation^29 also assumes\nthat mental representations and functions are grounded in one\u2019s own\nexperiences and interactions with physical reality. For instance, if people\nwant to take revenge through permanent removal (e.g. hatred for ex), they may\ndestroy a related entity such that it is no longer recognisable (burn, melt,\nor tear related). In a related study, Bri\u00f1ol et al.^30 reported that writing\ndown negative thoughts about a Mediterranean diet on a piece of paper and\ndisposing of the paper in a trash can result in lower negative (more positive)\nevaluations of the diet, compared to a group that kept the paper in a booklet.\nThese attitude changes may derive from the cognitive fusion that people often\nfuse with physical objects, such as jewellery, cars, and family heirlooms^31.\nSuch fused objects are valued more and are less likely to be abandoned because\ndoing so means losing a part of themselves^32,33. Specifically, throwing an\nobject associated with negative emotions (anger) may result in losing the\nnegative emotions (anger). However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has\ntested whether the disposal of anger-written paper can reduce or even\neliminate anger.\n\nPrevious studies from a situated cognitive approach to anger management have\nchanged the external environment of the individual in anger. Tool (object) use\nhas received scant attention in these situated cognition approaches to anger\nmanagement, except for a few studies, such as hitting a punching bag^34 and\nplaying a video game^35. This study examined a method in which the disposal of\na paper (object) on which participants wrote down their descriptions or\nthoughts about a provocative event could neutralise anger. Participants threw\nthe anger-written paper into a trash box in Experiment 1, and put the paper\ninto a shredder in Experiment 2. If the action of disposal is crucial to\nmodifying emotions, anger would be reduced only in participants in Experiment\n1 but not in Experiment 2, as predicted by the grounded separation\nprocedure^29. Nevertheless, if anger was modified by the meaning of disposal,\nthe subjective ratings of anger would be eliminated in both experiments. The\ndisposal of the paper with the written descriptions would remove the\npsychological existence of anger for the provoked participants along with the\ndisposal of paper by the dynamic interactions with the object^24. This simple\nmethod of eliminating anger could potentially contribute to effective parental\nanger management toward their children.\n\n### Materials and method\n\n#### Participants\n\nA total of 57 students (women = 21, mean age = 21.11, SD = 1.05) from a local\nuniversity participated in this experiment. The data from seven participants\nwere excluded from the final analysis because they correctly guessed the\npurpose of the experiment and they did not express induced anger by insult\n(subjective ratings of anger were lower or the same compared to those of the\nbaseline), as was the case in a previous study^36. Our final analysis included\n50 participants (women = 16, mean age = 21.10, SD = 1.08). A sample size of 50\nparticipants was determined by G*Power 3.1.9.4^37 using the a priori procedure\nfor repeated measures ANOVA, within (periods)\u2014between (disposal and retention)\ninteraction with the parameters of 95% power, an expected effect size of 0.25\n(defined as a medium effect by Cohen^38), alpha level of 0.05, a within-\nsubjects measurement correlation of 0.5, and a nonsphericity correction \u03b5 of\n1. The calculation suggested a sample size of 22 participants in each group.\nBased on these analyses, we concluded that the sample size was appropriate for\nthis study.\n\n#### Materials\n\nAngry feelings were assessed with five adjective items: angry, bothered,\nannoyed, hostile, and irritated. These adjectives were previously used as\nmeasures of self-reported anger^39. In this study, each response scale ranged\nfrom 1 (not at all) to 6 (extremely). As was the case in a previous study on\nanger^40, scores on these five adjectives were averaged to form an anger\nexperience composite, which was the score used in the analysis (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 =\n0.90). We also used Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) as a\nsubjective scale to assess mainly negative feelings^38. We used the Japanese\nversion of the 6-point PANAS scale^41.\n\n#### Procedure\n\nIn this experiment, participants' subjective emotional states were measured at\nthree time points (baseline, post-provocation, and post-writing). The\nparticipants were told to write an essay on social problems (e.g., smoking in\npublic) for which they would receive feedback from a doctoral student\nassessing the quality of the essay. They had seen the doctoral student before\nentering the experimental room. After the participants wrote the essay, they\ncompleted the PANAS and anger questionnaires for the baseline. The evaluation\nby the fictitious doctoral student was then provided to the participants. The\nevaluation included ratings of the essay on six characteristics using a\n9-point scale (e.g. for intelligence, 1 = unintelligent, 9 = intelligent). All\nparticipants were given the following ratings: intelligence = 3, interest = 3,\nfriendliness = 2, logic = 3, respectability = 4, and rationality = 3. Each\nessay was also provided with the following comment: \u2018I cannot believe an\neducated person would think like this. I hope this person learns something\nwhile at the university\u2019^40,42. All of these manipulations were successfully\nused in our previous study^40. The participants were required to read the\nfeedback ratings and comments silently for two minutes. Then, they filled out\nthe subjective emotional questionnaires (PANAS and anger adjectives) for the\npost-provocation period.\n\nThen, the participants were asked to write every thought of them on receiving\nthe feedback and were given three minutes for this. The instruction was \u2018Think\nabout the event from your own perspective. Concentrate especially on the\nthings that originally triggered the emotions and your reactions\u2019. We added\nguide questions (\u2018Why were you feeling this way?\u2019, \u2018What made you feel this\nway?\u2019) to induce analytical rumination. To allow the participants to write\nabout their honest feelings, they were informed that the written paper would\nnot be seen by anyone, including the experimenter. After writing, the\nparticipants were asked to review the sentences carefully for 30 s. For the\nretention group, the paper was turned over, put in a clear plastic folder, and\nplaced on the right side of the desk. The participants in the disposal group\nrolled up the paper into a crumpled ball, stood up, threw the paper into the\ntrash can held by the experimenter, and sat back in the chair. Finally, both\ngroups of participants filled out the subjective emotional questionnaires\n(anger adjectives and PANAS) for the post-writing period. At the end of the\nexperiment, all participants were debriefed and informed of the truth. They\nwere also assured that the evaluations of their essays had been prepared in\nadvance.\n\n### Data analyses\n\nAngry feelings were analysed using a 2 (group: disposal or retention) \u00d7 3\n(period: at baseline, post-provocation, and post-writing) ANOVA. All\nsignificance levels were set at p < 0.05. We used the Greenhouse\u2013Geisser\ncorrection when Mauchly\u2019s test of sphericity was violated. When the\ninteraction was significant, multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni\ncorrection method were used to assess the differences.\n\nWe also report Bayes factors (BFs) from the Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA\nin JASP^43. For BFs, BF_10 values reflect the probability of an alternative\nrelative to the null hypothesis. BFs greater than 3 indicate support for the\nhypotheses. A BF favouring the alternative over the null hypothesis (BF_10)\noffers strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis when it is over 10.\nValues less than 0.33 indicate support for the null hypothesis, and values\nbetween 0.33 and 3 indicate data insensitivity. We also reported 95%\nconfidence intervals.\n\nWe aimed to examine (1) whether angry feelings resumed in the disposal group,\nand (2) whether angry feelings were different between the groups after the\ndisposal or retention treatments. Our main interest was angry feelings, while\nwe also verified PANAS scores using a 2 (group: disposal or retention) \u00d7 3\n(period: at baseline, post-provocation, and post-writing) ANOVA.\n\n#### Ethics statement\n\nAll participants were paid for their participation and had provided written\ninformed consent in accordance with the procedures before participation. The\nstudy was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Cognitive and\nPsychological Sciences at Nagoya University (201104-C-02\u201302). All methods were\ncarried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of\nHelsinki. All participants provided their written and informed consent prior\nto starting the study.\n\n### Results\n\n#### Anger experience\n\nThe left panel of Fig. 1 shows mean subjective ratings of anger for disposal\nand retention groups at three time points (baseline, post-provocation, and\npost-writing). Subjective ratings of anger of both groups increased at the\npost-provocation (M_disposal = 3.34, SD = 1.20, 95% CI [2.86, 3.82];\nM_retention = 3.45, SD = 1.11, 95% CI [3.00, 3.89]) from the baseline\n(M_disposal = 1.59, SD = 0.50, 95% CI [1.39, 1.79]; M_retention = 1.78, SD =\n0.71, 95% CI [1.50, 2.07]). Subjective ratings at the post-writing decreased\nfrom the post-provocation, however those of retention group were still higher\nthan the baseline (M_retention = 2.64, SD = 0.95, 95% CI [2.26, 3.02]), while\nthose of disposal group eliminated at the same level of the baseline\n(M_disposal = 1.87, SD = 0.71, 95% CI [1.59, 2.16]). A 2 (group: disposal or\nretention) \u00d7 3 (period: at baseline, post-provocation, and post-writing) mixed\nmodel analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of\nperiod [F (2, 96) = 73.36, p < 0.001, partial \u03b7^2 = 0.60, BF_10 > 100], while\na main effect of group was not significant [F (1, 48) = 3.21, p > 0.05,\npartial \u03b7^2 = 0.06, BF_10 = 0.66]. The interaction between group and period\nwas significant [F (2, 96) = 3.12, p < 0.05, partial \u03b7^2 = 0.06, BF_10 =\n1.17]. Multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni method revealed that the\nsubjective anger was significantly higher at the post-provocation than those\nat the baseline (p < 0.05), indicating that a provocative manipulation was\nexerted. Subjective ratings of anger post-writing decreased significantly,\ncompared to post-provocation (p < 0.05). Importantly, however, subjective\nratings of retention group at the post-writing period were still significantly\nhigher than those of the baseline period (p < 0.05), whereas those of disposal\ngroup at the post-writing period eliminated to levels of the baseline period\n(p > 0.05). Subjective ratings of disposal group at the post-writing period\nwere significantly lower than those of retention group (p < 0.01).\n\nFigure 1\n\nSelf-reported anger during Experiment 1 (left) and Experiment 2 (right).\nSignificant differences emerged at the end of time due to experimental\nmanipulations. Possible values for anger range from 1 to 6. Each vertical line\nillustrates the 95% confidence intervals for each group.\n\nFull size image\n\n#### Negative and positive affect\n\nThe negative affect subscale of the PANAS at post-provocation (M_disposal =\n3.10, SD = 1.00, 95% CI [2.70, 3.49]; M_retention = 3.06, SD = 1.03, 95% CI\n[2.64, 3.47]) was higher than at baseline (M_disposal = 2.45, SD = 0.66, 95%\nCI [2.18, 2.71]; M_retention = 2.50, SD = 0.84, 95% CI [2.16, 2.83]) and post-\nwriting (M_disposal = 2.06, SD = 0.65, 95% CI [1.80, 2.32]; M_retention =\n2.39, SD = 0.88, 95% CI [2.04, 2.73]). The 95% CIs of the disposal group\noverlapped a little bit between post-provocation [2.70, 3.49] and baseline\nperiods [2.18, 2.71], and those of the retention group overlapped between both\nthe post-provocation [2.64, 3.47] and baseline [2.16, 2.83]. The 95% CIs for\nthe post-writing means partially overlapped between the groups. A 2 (group) \u00d7\n3 (period) mixed ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of period [F (2, 96)\n= 28.64, p < 0.001, partial \u03b7^2 = 0.37, BF_10 > 100]. However, the main effect\nof group [F (1, 48) = 0.29, p > 0.05, partial \u03b7^2 = 0.01, BF_10 = 0.32] and\nthe interaction between group and period were not significant [F (2, 96) =\n1.35, p > 0.05, partial \u03b7^2 = 0.03, BF_10 = 0.31]. Multiple comparisons with\nthe Bonferroni method revealed that the subjective negative affect post-\nprovocation was significantly higher than at baseline and post-writing (ps <\n0.05).\n\nThe PANAS positive affect subscale showed little variation at three periods\n(M_disposal = 2.33, SD = 0.80, 95% CI [2.01, 2.65]; M_retention = 2.32, SD =\n0.75, 95% CI [2.01, 2.62]), post-provocation (M_disposal = 2.44, SD = 0.76,\n95% CI [2.13, 2.75]; M_retention = 2.42, SD = 0.89, 95% CI [2.06, 2.78]), and\npost-writing (M_disposal = 2.38, SD = 0.87, 95% CI [2.03, 2.73]; M_retention =\n2.27, SD = 0.83, 95% CI [1.93, 2.60]). A 2 \u00d7 3 mixed ANOVA revealed that\nneither main effects nor interaction was significant (Fs < 0.90, ps > 0.41,\nBF_10s < 0.14).\n\n### Discussion\n\nThis study examined whether writing about the provocative event and disposing\nof the paper into a trash can would suppress anger. The provocation treatments\nevoked anger in both the groups similarly. Nevertheless, the retention group\nstill showed significantly higher anger compared to levels at the baseline\nperiod, while the disposal group completely eliminated their anger after the\ndisposal of the anger-written paper. These results suggest that the disposal\nof the paper containing ruminated anger into the trash can neutralise anger.\nOur interpretation is that the act of throwing the paper with ruminated anger\ninto the trash can produces a feeling similar to the psychological existence\n(anger) being discarded, leading to anger elimination, since the psychological\nentity (anger) was disposed along with the physical object (anger-written\npaper).\n\nOne may argue that it was not the disposal itself but the physical distance\nplayed a critical role in reducing anger. Since the paper was distanced from\nparticipants in the disposal group, whereas the paper in the retention group\nwas located by them. Nevertheless, Zhang et al.^44 showed that engaging in an\navoidance action rather than creating physical distance was critical for\nreversing the perceived effect of negative thoughts. In their study\n(Experiment 5), participants in avoidance action conditions either threw the\nball to the opposite corner of the room (creating physical distance between\nthemselves and the ball), or pretended to throw the ball (creating no distance\nbetween themselves and the ball). Participants in the no-avoidance action\ncondition either carried the ball to the opposite corner of the room and left\nit there (creating physical distance between the self and the ball without\ninvolving a throwing action) or held the ball in their non-dominant hand\n(creating no distance). Participants in both avoidance action conditions\nreversed the negative thoughts, while participants in both no-avoidance\nconditions did not. Avoidance actions were crucial in their study. Therefore,\nthe physical distance would not contribute to reduce anger in this study.\nHowever, disposal action might be the key to neutralising anger in this study.\nNevertheless, we assume that the meaning (i.e. interpretation) of disposal is\nmore important than the action itself. Other studies have also suggested that\nthe meaning of an action is critical for determining its impact, not the\naction itself^30,45. This study could not exclude throwing action's potential\ncontribution to neutralising anger. Thus, we conducted another experiment to\nexclude the potential contribution of the throwing action as much as possible,\nconfirm the effectiveness of the disposal method, and explore the variation in\nthis method.\n\n## Experiment 2\n\n### Introduction\n\nExperiment 1 indicated that the disposal of a piece of paper containing the\ndescription of an anger-inducing experience into the trash can neutralise\nanger. However, it was unclear what aspect of the paper\u2019s disposal neutralised\nanger. Although we interpreted the meaning of the action as critical to\nneutralising anger, the physical distance between the participant and the\npaper or the action itself (i.e. embodied cognition) might have played a\ncritical role. We set up the second experiment: (1) to replicate the results\nof Experiment 1; (2) to exclude the embodied explanation as much as possible;\nand (3) to explore another version of the disposal method using a shredder on\nthe desk. In this experiment, we asked participants to put the paper\ncontaining anger into the shredder instead of throwing it into the trash can\nwhich was kept at some distance from the participants. We also made a small\nchange to the retention group. Participants of retention group put the paper\ninto a clear box on the desk, and the disposal group put the paper into the\nshredder. Thus, the distance between the participants and the paper and the\ntype of action were matched between the two groups. If the sensorimotor\nexperience of throwing the paper was critical to neutralise anger, we would\nnot be able to replicate the results of Experiment 1. Nevertheless, if the\nmeaning of the disposal of a physical entity plays a critical role in reducing\nanger, we anticipated obtaining similar results. In line with our prediction,\nthe attitude changed when the paper was transferred to a box labelled \u2018trash\ncan\u2019, which indicated mentally discarding it, compared to a box labelled\n\u2018safety box\u2019^46, suggesting that the perceived meaning of actions, and not the\nactions per se, influence attitude change. Hence, we designed a new study to\nconfirm whether the perceived meaning of action eliminates anger. We predicted\nthat putting the paper in a shredder would reduce negative emotions (anger),\nas compared to keeping the paper.\n\n### Method\n\n#### Participants\n\nA total of 48 participants (women = 24, mean age = 26.81, SD = 9.42) were\nparticipated through worker dispatching company and a local university. There\nwas no overlap between the participants of the two experiments. This sample\nsize was determined using G*Power 3.1.9.4^37 using the a priori procedure for\nrepeated measures ANOVA, within (periods)\u2013between (disposal and retention)\ninteraction with the parameters of 95% power, an expected effect size of 0.25\n(defined as a medium effect by Cohen^38), alpha level of 0.05, a within-\nparticipants measurement correlation of 0.5, and a nonsphericity correction \u03b5\nof 1. The calculation suggested a sample size of 22 participants in each\ngroup. Based on these analyses, we concluded that the sample size was\nappropriate for this study. As in Experiment 1, the data of two participants\nwere excluded from the final analysis because they correctly guessed the\npurpose of the experiment and did not express anger by insult (subjective\nratings of anger were lower or the same as those at the baseline). Our final\nanalysis included 46 participants (women = 23, mean age = 26.39, SD = 9.14).\n\n#### Materials\n\nAs in Experiment 1, angry feelings were assessed using five adjectives: angry,\nbothered, annoyed, hostile, and irritated. Responses ranged from 1 (not at\nall) to 6 (extremely). Scores on these five adjectives will be averaged to\nform an anger experience composite, which is the score used in the analyses.\nWe also used the Japanese version of the 6-point PANAS scale as a subjective\nscale to assess mainly negative feelings^40,41.\n\nFor the disposal group, a dustbin-type shredder (ACCO Brands Japan Corp,\nGSHA26MB) was used. This shredder (30 cm \u00d7 10 cm \u00d7 28 cm) cuts paper into\npieces of 2 mm \u00d7 14 mm on putting the paper in from the top. The lower part of\nthe shredder holds a transparent dustbin, so that the pieces of paper can be\nobserved from the outside. For the retention group, a hand-made clear plastic\nbox (23 cm \u00d7 5 cm \u00d7 30 cm) was used. Paper can be placed from the top, as with\nthe shredder. Furthermore, as with the lower part of the shredder, the box is\nalso transparent so that the paper in the box can be observed from the\noutside.\n\n#### Procedure\n\nThis experiment followed the same method used in Experiment 1 with slight\nchanges. The words \u201cwhile at university\u201d were removed from the provocative\ncomment (\u2018I cannot believe an educated person would think like this. I hope\nthis person learns something while at university\u2019^40,42, because non-students\nparticipated in this study. The second change was the method of disposing or\nretaining the paper containing a description of the anger-inducing experience.\nAfter participants wrote down provocative events in an analytical manner, a\ntransparent box or a transparent shredder bin was placed on the desk in front\nof them (Fig. 2), before they were asked to review the sentences carefully for\n30 s. Then, participants were required to put the paper into the box, with the\nfrontside of the paper facing them. Participants in the disposal group watched\nas the paper was cut in the shredder for five seconds. Participants in the\nretention group were required to enclose the paper in a clear file folder and\nplace it in a transparent box showing their written sentences. Then, they\nobserved the paper carefully for five seconds. Subsequently, the box was\nturned back to show the blank side of the paper. All participants rated their\nanger and provided responses to the PANAS after these treatments.\n\nFigure 2\n\nPictures of experimental manipulations in Experiment 2. The disposal group\n(left) put the paper into the shredder, while the retention group (right) put\nthe paper into the transparent box.\n\nFull size image\n\n### Results\n\n#### Anger experience\n\nThe right panel of Fig. 1 shows the mean subjective anger ratings for the\ndisposal and retention groups at the three time points (baseline, post-\nprovocation, and post-writing). This pattern of results is similar to that of\nExperiment 1. Subjective ratings of anger in both groups increased after\nprovocation (M_disposal = 3.14, SD = 1.38, 95% CI [2.56, 3.72]; M_retention =\n3.24, SD = 1.04, 95% CI [2.80, 3.67]) from baseline (M_disposal = 1.57, SD =\n0.75, 95% CI [1.25, 1.88]; M_retention = 1.64, SD = 0.59, 95% CI [1.40,\n1.89]). Subjective ratings at post-writing decreased from post-provocation.\nHowever, those of the retention group were still higher than those of the\nbaseline (M_retention = 2.75, SD = 1.05, 95% CI [2.31, 3.19]), while those of\nthe disposal group were eliminated at the same level as the baseline\n(M_disposal = 1.98, SD = 0.87, 95% CI [1.62, 2.35]). Only a small overlap\n(0.04) was observed in the 95% CI for the mean post-writing scores between the\ngroups. A 2 (group: disposal or retention) \u00d7 3 (period: at baseline, post-\nprovocation, and post-writing) mixed model ANOVA revealed a significant main\neffect of period [F (2, 88) = 56.93, p < 0.001, partial \u03b7^2 = 0.56, BF_10 >\n100], while the main effect of group was not significant [F (1, 44) = 1.68, p\n> 0.05, partial \u03b7^2 = 0.04, BF_10 = 0.46]. The interaction between group and\nperiod was significant [F (2, 88) = 3.49, p < 0.05, partial \u03b7^2 = 0.07, BF_10\n= 1.62]. Multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni method revealed that\nsubjective anger was significantly higher at post-provocation than baseline (p\n< 0.05), indicating that provocative manipulation was exerted. Subjective\nratings of anger at post-writing decreased significantly compared to post-\nprovocation (p < 0.05). However, the subjective ratings of the retention group\nin the post-writing period were still maintained at the same level of anger as\nthose of the post-provocation period (p > 0.05). Contrastingly, those of the\ndisposal group in the post-writing period were significantly lower than those\nof the post-provocation period (p < 0.05).\n\nAdditionally, as was the result of Experiment1, the subjective ratings of the\nretention group in the post-writing period were significantly higher than\nthose of the baseline period (p < 0.05). Those of the disposal group in the\npost-writing period were eliminated to the baseline period (p > 0.05). The\nsubjective ratings of the disposal group in the post-writing period were\nsignificantly lower than those of the retention group (p < 0.05).\n\n#### Negative and positive affect\n\nThe negative affect subscale of the PANAS at post-provocation (M_disposal =\n3.34, SD = 1.09, 95% CI [2.88, 3.79]; M_retention = 3.35, SD = 0.89, 95% CI\n[2.98, 3.73]) was higher than at baseline (M_disposal = 2.60, SD = 0.78, 95%\nCI [2.27, 2.93]; M_retention = 2.73, SD = 0.92, 95% CI [2.34, 3.11]) and post-\nwriting (M_disposal = 2.45, SD = 0.96, 95% CI [2.05, 2.85]; M_retention =\n2.57, SD = 0.87, 95% CI [2.20, 2.93]). The 95% CIs of the disposal group\noverlapped a little bit between post-provocation [2.88, 3.79] and baseline\nperiods [2.27, 2.93], and those of the retention group overlapped between both\nthe post-provocation [2.98, 3.73] and baseline [2.34, 3.11]. A 2 (group) \u00d7 3\n(period) mixed ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of period [F (2, 88) =\n20.19, p < 0.01, partial \u03b7^2 = 0.68, BF_10 > 100]. However, the main effect of\nthe group [F (1, 44) = 0.15, p > 0.05, partial \u03b7^2 = 0.06, BF_10 = 0.33] and\nthe interaction between group and period were not significant [F (2, 88) =\n1.35, p > 0.05, partial \u03b7^2 = 0.05, BF_10 = 0.13]. Multiple comparisons with\nthe Bonferroni method revealed that the subjective negative affect post-\nprovocation was significantly higher than at baseline and post-writing (ps <\n0.05).\n\nThe positive affect subscale of the PANAS showed little variation at the\nthree-time points (M_disposal = 2.88, SD = 1.03, 95% CI [2.44, 3.31];\nM_retention = 2.57, SD = 0.89), 95% CI [2.19, 2.94], post-provocation\n(M_disposal = 2.49, SD = 0.86, 95% CI [2.13, 2.85]; M_retention = 2.51, SD =\n0.94, 95% CI [2.12, 2.90]), and post-writing (M_disposal = 2.49, SD = 0.97,\n95% CI [2.08, 2.89]; M_retention = 2.64, SD = 1.02, 95% CI [2.21, 3.06]). A 2\n\u00d7 3 mixed ANOVA revealed that neither the main effects nor interaction were\nsignificant (Fs < 2.28, ps > 0.11, BF_10s < 0.70).\n\n### Discussion\n\nThe results were essentially the same as those of Experiment 1. The disposal\ngroup significantly reduced their anger after disposing of the anger-written\npaper into the shredder. The retention group showed significantly higher anger\nthan the baseline period and disposal group. These results suggest that the\nresults in Experiment 1 could be attributed neither to the physical distance\nbetween the participant and the paper nor to the action itself (i.e. embodied\ncognition). Specifically, Experiment 2 replicated the results of Experiment 1\nand excluded the embodied explanation (the sensorimotor experience of throwing\nthe paper) because the action of the disposal group was quite similar to that\nof the retention group in Experiment 2. The distance between participant and\npaper was the same in both groups, as the transparent box and shredder were\nplaced on the desk.\n\n### General discussion\n\nThis study aimed to determine whether the disposal of anger-written papers\ncould eliminate or at least reduce subjective anger. Disposal manipulation\neliminated anger, either by throwing the paper into a trash can or placing it\ninto the shredder. We propose that this anger reduction method is quite\neffective, so the subjective ratings of anger resumed as much as the baseline\nlevels. We believe that this method can be used in daily life and especially\nfor populations characterised by extreme levels of anger and aggression in\ntheir home. The use of this method may potentially contribute to emotion\nsocialization, as parents are the primary model for their children.\n\nThese results indicate that the sensorimotor experience of throwing paper\nplays a small role in reducing subjective anger^44. Instead, the meaning\n(interpretation) of disposal plays a critical role. These results are\nconsistent with other studies which showed that the meaning of disposal was\ncritical for determining its impact, not the action itself^30,45. However,\nthese results are partially inconsistent with those reported by Zhang et\nal.^44. Their experiment tested whether certain behaviors could lower the\nperceived likelihood of bad luck, as is often the case with jinxes.\nParticipants who threw a ball believed that a jinxed-negative outcome was less\nlikely than those who held the ball. They demonstrated that engaging in an\navoidant action rather than creating physical distance was critical for\nreversing the perceived effect of the jinx. The results of Experiment 1 in\nthis study are consistent with their results. However, we demonstrated that\nneither avoidance action nor physical distance was crucial in reducing\nsubjective anger.\n\nOur results may be related to the phenomenon of \u2018backward magical\ncontagion\u2019^47, which is the belief that actions taken on an object (e.g. hair)\nassociated with an individual can affect the individuals themselves. Rozin et\nal.^48 discovered that individuals experience strong negative emotions when\ntheir personal objects are possessed by negative others (such as rapists or\nenemies). However, these emotions are reduced when the objects are destroyed,\nsuch as throwing them in a septic tank or burning them. The phenomenon of\n\u2018magical contagion\u2019 or \u2018celebrity contagion\u2019 refers to the belief that the\n\u2018essence\u2019 of an individual can be transferred to their possessions. This\nbackward magical contagion operates in a reversed process, where manipulating\nan object associated with a person is thought to impact the individuals\nthemselves. The current study's findings may be explained by the concept of\nbackward magical contagion, which posits that negative emotions can be\ntransferred from others to an individual through their possessions. This study\ndid not involve the direct mediation of other individuals. The neutralization\nof subjective anger through the disposal of an object may be achieved by\nrecognizing that the physical entity, such as a piece of paper, has been\ndiminished, thus causing the original emotion to also disappear.\n\nAt least, however, some limitations regarding this disposal method should be\naddressed in future studies. First, the findings of this study are based on\nthe assumption that participants identified their subjective anger with the\npaper. Thus, subjective anger had gone with the anger-written paper after its\ndisposal. The participants were asked to review the sentences carefully for 30\ns to enhance this identification between thought and paper. It is not clear\nwhether this review process is necessary for identification.\n\nAnother limitation is that we did not test a digital device, such as a word\nprocessor or smartphone, but used only papers. We believe the present disposal\nmethod can be generalised to a digital device, whereas empirical data are\nlimited only by physical entities, papers, trash cans, or shredders. Suppose\nthe disposal method is proven to be effective in digital devices. In that\ncase, it will be adopted in various situations, such as business meetings or\ndaily conversations in schools, by writing and disposing of with a smartphone.\n\nFurthermore, although the disposal method had a more significant effect so\nthat the subjective ratings of anger were eliminated as much as the baseline\nlevels, the effectiveness of this method was not directly compared to other\nanger reduction methods, such as self-distancing. Other methods may be as\neffective or even more effective than the present disposal method. Personality\ntraits may modulate the effects of anger suppression, although this has not\nbeen examined in the techniques used in this or in other studies. Individuals\nwith high (versus low) levels of trait anger tended to experience lapses in\neffortful control when exposed to anger-relevant stimuli^49,50. As mentioned\nabove, although cognitive reappraisal (the reinterpretation of the meaning of\nan unpleasant event) is considered an effective way to reduce anger^12, it\nrequires more significant cognitive effort^13,14. Self-distancing is not\nfeasible, particularly during the heat of the moment^13. Conversely, the\ndisposal method with low cognitive effort used in this study may be more\neffective for individuals with lower levels of trait self-control than for\nthose with high trait self-control. Future research should examine whether\npersonality traits moderate the relationship between the disposal method and\nthe expected outcomes.\n\nIndividuals with higher levels of trait anger tended to have prolonged\nexperiences of induced state anger^51. However, experimental research on anger\nregulation strategies has predominantly emphasized the effectiveness of\nimmediate control^10,11,12, neglecting to investigate whether these strategies\nare equally effective in managing anger that persists over time. However, in\neveryday life, it is not always feasible to implement anger regulation\nstrategies immediately after anger arises. Therefore, to ascertain its\npractical utility in real-world settings, it is imperative to examine whether\nthe effectiveness of the disposal method varies with the duration of anger.\n\nMoreover, it should be tested whether the disposal method can suppress\nsubjective anger even if participants write down a provocation event in an\nexperiential manner rather than in the analytic rumination manner used in this\nstudy. Previous studies suggest that anger rumination can maintain^52 or even\nincrease^53 the original level of anger when participants wrote down a\nprovocation event in an experiential rumination manner. As it may not be easy\nto write down analytically, especially in the heat of the moment, the disposal\nmethod will gain further strength if it is valid by experiential rumination.\n\nIt should be mentioned that although provocation was effective in both the\nsubjective anger score and the PANAS negative score, the revealed emotion\nregulation strategy in this study seemed specific to anger (as no significant\ninteraction effect for the PANAS negative score was observed). Kubo et al.^40\nreported that the increase in the state of anger relevant to approach\nmotivation (aggression) by provocation (measured using the STAXI and asymmetry\nof prefrontal brain activity) was reduced by an apology comment. However, an\nincrease in the subjective scores of negative emotion (assessed using the\nPANAS) remained unchanged, regardless of the presence or absence of an apology\ncomment. They proposed anger as not a unitary process but one that comprises\nmultiple independent components (subjective anger and negative feelings). If\nthe anger scale used in this study reflects the approach motivation component\nof anger as well as the STAXI, the disposal method appears to specifically\nsuppress the components of anger\u2019s approach motivation (aggression) and can be\nused to reduce aggression as a clinical technique.\n\nDespite these limitations, this is the first study to be designed and used to\nconveniently eliminate subjective anger by interacting with physical entities.\nIt offers a cost-effective and easy-to-use method to reduce anger by\nrumination about the provocative event, which otherwise lasts longer. Anyone\nwith a pen and piece of paper can use this method. Suppose one maintains a\ndiary or a personal log. In that case, they can write down a provocative event\non the day on the memo pad, and throwing it into the trash can eliminate the\nprovocative event. This action may help neutralize the negative emotions\nassociated with the event, potentially protecting the children\u2019s emotional\nsocialization.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis study presents a new and convenient method for eliminating subjective\nanger. This method offers a cost-effective way to eliminate anger in various\nsituations, including business meetings, childcare, and clinical applications.\nThe building blocks of this method (e.g. applying it to a digital device or\ncreating a specific application) could be useful in various daily situations\nas well as behavioural therapies. In particular, for someone who has\ndifficulty suppressing their anger in their homes.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe datasets used and analysed during the current study available from the\ncorresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
