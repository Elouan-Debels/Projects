Doing so requires rethinking\nsystems design in deep collaboration with service developers. This rethinking\nhas resulted in our significant investment in custom silicon. Today, we are\nthrilled to announce the latest incarnation of this work: Google Axion\nProcessors, our first custom ArmR-based CPUs designed for the data center.\nAxion delivers industry-leading performance and energy efficiency and will be\navailable to Google Cloud customers later this year.\n\nRun general-purpose workloads on C4A for exceptional performance, energy-\nefficiency and advanced capabilities.\n\nAxion is but the latest in a long line of custom Google silicon. Since 2015\nwe\u2019ve released five generations of Tensor Processing Units (TPU); in 2018 we\nreleased our first Video Coding Unit (VCU), achieving up to 33x more\nefficiency for video transcoding; in 2021, we doubled-down on custom compute\nby investing in \u201csystem on a chip\u201d (SoC) designs, and released the first of\nthree generations of Tensor chips for mobile devices.\n\nWhile our investments in compute accelerators have transformed our customers\u2019\ncapabilities, general-purpose compute is and will remain a critical portion of\nour customers\u2019 workloads. Analytics, information retrieval, and ML training\nand serving all require a huge amount of compute power. Customers and users\nwho wish to maximize performance, reduce infrastructure costs, and meet\nsustainability goals have found that the rate of CPU improvements has slowed\nrecently. Amdahl\u2019s Law suggests that as accelerators continue to improve,\ngeneral purpose compute will dominate the cost and limit the capability of our\ninfrastructure unless we make commensurate investments to keep up.\n\nAxion processors combine Google\u2019s silicon expertise with Arm\u2019s highest\nperforming CPU cores to deliver instances with up to 30% better performance\nthan the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances available in the cloud\ntoday, up to 50% better performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency\nthan comparable current-generation x86-based instances^1. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve\nalready started deploying Google services like BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery,\nBlobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine, and the YouTube Ads platform on\ncurrent generation Arm-based servers and plan to deploy and scale these\nservices and more on Axion soon.\n\n### Unrivaled performance and efficiency, underpinned by Titanium\n\nBuilt using the Arm NeoverseTM V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant leaps in\nperformance for general-purpose workloads like web and app servers,\ncontainerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory caches, data\nanalytics engines, media processing, CPU-based AI training and inferencing,\nand more.\n\nAxion is underpinned by Titanium, a system of purpose-built custom silicon\nmicrocontrollers and tiered scale-out offloads. Titanium offloads take care of\nplatform operations like networking and security, so Axion processors have\nmore capacity and improved performance for customer workloads. Titanium also\noffloads storage I/O processing to Hyperdisk, our new block storage service\nthat decouples performance from instance size and that can be dynamically\nprovisioned in real time.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s announcement of the new Axion CPU marks a significant milestone in\ndelivering custom silicon that is optimized for Google\u2019s infrastructure, and\nbuilt on our high-performance Arm Neoverse V2 platform. Decades of ecosystem\ninvestment, combined with Google\u2019s ongoing innovation and open-source software\ncontributions ensure the best experience for the workloads that matter most to\ncustomers running on Arm everywhere.\" - Rene Haas, CEO, Arm\n\nBeyond performance, customers want to operate more efficiently and meet their\nsustainability goals. Google Cloud data centers are already 1.5X more\nefficient than the industry average and deliver 3X more computing power with\nthe same amount of electrical power compared with five years ago^2. We\u2019ve set\nambitious goals to operate our offices, campuses, and data centers on carbon-\nfree energy, 24/7, and offer tools to help you report on carbon emissions.\nWith Axion processors, customers can optimize for even more energy-efficiency.\n\n### Axion - out-of-the-box application compatibility and interoperability\n\nGoogle also has a rich history of contributions to the Arm ecosystem. We built\nand open sourced Android, Kubernetes, Tensorflow and the Go language, and\nworked closely with Arm and industry partners to optimize them for the Arm\narchitecture.\n\nAxion is built on the standard Armv9 architecture and instruction set. Most\nrecently, we contributed to SystemReady Virtual Environment (VE), Arm\u2019s\nhardware and firmware interoperability standard that ensures common operating\nsystems and software packages can seamlessly run on Arm-based servers and VMs,\nmaking it easier for customers to deploy Arm workloads on Google Cloud with\nlimited-if-any code rewrites. Through this collaboration, we\u2019re accessing an\necosystem of tens of thousands of cloud customers already deploying workloads\nand leveraging Arm-native software from hundreds of ISVs and open-source\nprojects.\n\nCustomers will be able to use Axion in many Google Cloud services including\nGoogle Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Dataflow, Cloud\nBatch, and more. Arm-compatible software and solutions are now available on\nthe Google Cloud Marketplace, and we've recently launched preview support for\nArm-based instances migration in the Migrate to Virtual Machines service.\n\n### What our customers and partners are saying\n\n\"We're thrilled to add application packages built on the new Axion Arm-based\nCPU for Google Cloud to the Bitnami by VMware Tanzu library. This will deliver\nsignificantly improved performance, attractive price-performance, and better\nsustainability for our users. We're excited to get our hands on the new Google\nAxion instances and do even more to help our customers streamline deployments\nand reduce their environmental footprint.\" - Mike Wookey, Senior Director R&D,\nTanzu Division, Broadcom\n\n\"Organizations all over the world rely on CrowdStrike and our single platform,\nsingle agent architecture to stop cloud breaches.
