One attack came from an outside adversary, the other from\nwithin the community itself. While the external threat triggered wider\nconsternation, the internal threat seems to me far more dangerous.\n\nNB: while I have created and contributed to various open-source projects over\nthe years, I am certainly not an expert on OSS governance. Today\u2019s edition of\nGood Tech Things is not intended to be \u201cthought leadership\u201d or whatever, just\na tool for me to organize my own thoughts.\n\n##\n\nOutside threat: The XZ thing\n\nIf nobody had ever heard of open-source, and you wrote an undergrad paper\ntoday proposing it as the way to develop the software that runs the world, you\nwould get an F minus.\n\nThesis sentence of your undergrad paper: Random people will anonymously create\nmuch of the world\u2019s critically important software in their spare time,\ncompanies will make billions of dollars by using it for free, and this\nsituation will remain shelf-stable for decades.\n\nInstructor\u2019s comment in red pen: This makes no sense. What would motivate any\nself-respecting software developer to participate in a scheme like this? And\nhow do you know the resultant code will be any good?\n\nPoint 1 of your paper: Obsessive nerds will tear each other to pieces to make\nsure the code is as good as possible, because they just can\u2019t help themselves.\n\nInstructor, in red pen: That doesn\u2019t sound like a sustainable state of\naffairs.\n\nPoint 2 of your paper: It works for Wikipedia.\n\nInstructor, in even redder pen: You are not allowed to cite Wikipedia in an\nacademic context. F minus.\n\nAnyway, open-source\u2014like Wikipedia and the BGP protocol\u2014is one of those\nnetworked-collaboration things that makes no sense on paper, but in practice\nis more resilient than any centrally-managed system could ever be. Not because\nof some brilliant technical innovation, but because it\u2019s an intensely human\nprocess. It works thanks to the pride and determination and sheer bloody-\nmindedness of beautiful weirdos all over the world.\n\nThe XZ thing put that messy, human resilience on full display. Here are the\nfacts as I understand them:\n\n  * There is an open-source data compression library called XZ that ships in popular Linux distros such as Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu.\n\n  * XZ\u2019s maintainer, Lasse Collins, was evidently somewhat burned out.\n\n  * A bad actor, probably state-sponsored, began harassing Collins through GitHub issues and comments, using multiple personas to demand that he pay more attention to the project.\n\n  * At the same time, the bad actor used a different persona (\u201cJia Tan\u201d) to worm their way into Collins\u2019 confidence over a period of months, eventually convincing him to let Jia Tan help out as a maintainer on XZ to quiet all the complaints.\n\n  * Collins, grateful for the help, allowed Jia Tan to commit code to the project.\n\n  * Some of the code Jia Tan put into XZ was a backdoor that would have granted the adversaries SSH access to EVERY SERVER RUNNING THE COMPROMISED VERSION OF XZ.\n\nThe backdoor was only discovered when a Microsoft employee and certified\nlegend named Andres Freund noticed SSH calls consuming extra CPU while he was\nrunning Postgres benchmarks, traced them to XZ, and sounded the alarm.\n\nCue freakout all over social media as everyone imagines what would have\nhappened if said backdoor had survived undetected long enough for state-\nsponsored adversaries to get SSH privileges on every Linux box in the world.\n\nThis is exactly the scenario your instructor with the red pen was afraid of.\nWhat chance do solitary, uncompensated open-source maintainers have defending\nthemselves from skilled, well-funded state actors with the patience to run\nyears-long social engineering campaigns? Probably not much chance.\n\nBut that\u2019s missing the point. As Mark Atwood says, the attack was not\nattempted because XZ was open source. The attack failed because it was open\nsource.\n\nDo you know what state actors do when they want to compromise closed-source\nsoftware? They just get hired at the software company and put across their\ndirty tricks with much-reduced scrutiny. Sunlight is the best disinfectant,\nand open source is solar-powered.\n\nThe XZ attack certainly exposes longstanding issues with OSS: maintainer\nburnout, the difficulty of aligning funding incentives, etc. But overall, I\nthink it\u2019s a beautiful example of open source doing what it does best:\nswarming a problem, socializing the fix, and then propagating better practices\ninto other projects within days, not years.\n\nIn my opinion, the least-helpful part of the response to XZ was actually from\nGitHub themselves, who suspended the project page\u2014making it harder for the\ncommunity to reconstruct the scope and timeline of the attack.\n\nAnd that sort of gestures toward the real problem.\n\n##\n\nThe inside threat\n\nAgain, caveat that I am neither a lawyer nor an open-source policy wonk, so I\nmight get something wrong here, and feel free to let me know if I do.\n\nExternal threats, as the XZ thing demonstrates, seem to have a galvanizing\neffect on the broader open-source community. OSS just gets stronger under\nstresses like that.\n\nThe thing I\u2019m most worried about now is the opposite: a chilling effect. And\nit\u2019s been creeping up on OSS like a glacier for over a decade.\n\nIndulge me while I detour for a quick history lesson. It\u2019s important, I\npromise.\n\n  * Late 2000s / early 2010s: Open-source as a loss leader. Companies like MongoDB and Elastic, who gained popularity among developers by giving their software away for free, have a fairly decent business model for open-source: they also sell hosted versions of their software as a service, alongside commercial support and so on.\n\n  * Mid-2010s: The host with the most. Guess who turns out to be REALLY good at selling hosted software as a service alongside commercial support and so on? Cloud providers! All of a sudden AWS has an Elasticsearch service, a Redis service, etc. Their network effects suck more and more customer dollars into the cloud provider, bypassing the company who is actually creating the open-source software. The OSS companies get increasingly frustrated by this.\n\n  * Late 2010s-early 2020s: License to kill. The OSS companies fight back with the only weapon they have: the license terms of their software. MongoDB switches to the Server-Side Public License (SSPL), as does Elastic and, just recently, Redis. Hashicorp chooses the Business Source License (BSL or BUSL) for its projects like Terraform and Vault. The new terms are not so much \u201copen-source\u201d as they are \u201csource-available\u201d: they are specifically designed to prevent other companies (cough, AWS) from making money by hosting their software.\n\n  * Mid-2020s: Fork you. The open-source community, who didn\u2019t ask for any of this to happen, (and somewhat egged on by the cloud providers), parries with the only weapon THEY have: forking the projects and building parallel versions under the original, open-source license terms. Terraform spawns OpenTofu, backed by the Linux Foundation; Redis is getting a fork called Valkey.\n\n  * Current situation: Everyone is mad at everyone.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, a very curious article appeared last week by Matt Asay,\na VP at MongoDB. The article suggests, more through insinuation than outright\naccusation, that the OpenTofu project is copying code from the new, BSL-\nlicensed version of Terraform back into their open-source fork.\n\nI should make it clear that I like and respect Matt; he and I have agreed on\nplenty of things over the years. He is also, unlike almost almost everyone\ninvolved in this discourse, trained as a lawyer. So I hesitate to dismiss his\nconcerns just because he works for a source-available software company.\n\nBut I also can\u2019t write this off as a minor squabble. Hashicorp evidently\nagrees with Matt; they\u2019ve sent a formal knock-it-off letter to the OpenTofu\nmaintainers. And at least one other critic of OpenTofu finds that the code in\nquestion sure does look an awful lot like Hashicorp\u2019s new features. The whole\nthing is made weirder due to the presence of Hashicorp copyrights in\nOpenTofu\u2019s new files, which Matt finds suspicious but the OpenTofu maintainers\nsay they included out of caution because they\u2019re moving a lot of code around.\nAgain, not a lot of lawyers involved here.\n\nOn the other side of the dispute, you have many angry proponents of OpenTofu\nsaying that this is a hit job, that of course the code looks similar because\nthere\u2019s only one reasonable way to implement the feature, etc. Calling back to\nour history lesson, it\u2019s instructive to note that some of the loudest\ndefenders of OpenTofu work for AWS.\n\nI have no way of knowing whether OpenTofu stole Hashicorp\u2019s code or not. Joe\nDuffy thinks that as a project whose goal is essentially to keep pace with\nTerraform\u2019s roadmap, they\u2019re in a tough spot either way. OpenTofu has said\nthey\u2019ll publish something soon that will clarify their innocence, but I doubt\nthey\u2019ll convince anyone who doesn\u2019t already support them.\n\nI guess I can see a couple ways this could go:\n\n  1. OpenTofu clearly demonstrates how they came up with the questionable code on their own, and Hashicorp\u2019s lawyers back down. If that\u2019s the case, I expect and hope that Matt would retract his article and offer an apology.\n\n  2. OpenTofu\u2019s explanation raises more questions than it answers, and Hashicorp decides to pick a nasty legal fight with the Linux Foundation.\n\n  3. There isn\u2019t convincing evidence one way or the other, so nobody backs down, but also it isn\u2019t really worth suing over, so everybody just grumbles at each other and nurses a grudge for next time.\n\nI think it\u2019s a lose-lose situation. Whichever way it shakes out, cases like\nthis\u2014and I expect they\u2019ll become more common as more OSS projects like\nOpenTofu and Valkey are started that \u201cshadow\u201d source-available versions\u2014have a\nchilling effect on everybody. Enterprises, who struggled to trust open-source\nfor years, now have a new reason to fear that OSS code might leave them liable\nto action from companies like Hashicorp. Developers hesitate to fork OSS\nprojects that might someday become source-available. Contributors don\u2019t want\nto be fired from their day jobs or named in a lawsuit because somebody makes a\nbad-faith case that they plagiarized code. Can you blame them if they burn\nout, slip away, become less enthusiastic about open-source solutions?\n\nHere is where, if I were a thought leader, I would make some grand-sounding\ncall for companies to \u201cdo better\u201d, or for OSS foundations to \u201crevisit their\ngovernance structures\u201d, or something. But this is an impasse that can\u2019t be\nsolved with platitudes. Cloud companies, fundamentally, see open-source as\nsomething to exploit; OSS software companies see it as incompatible with a\nsustainable business model. Contributors who don\u2019t work for either side are\ngetting trampled on. And eventually, as the ecosystem fractures, everybody\nloses. The whole situation is just sad.\n\nIn the end, the fragile balance of open source\u2014that unlikely blend of\npersonalities and incentives that has driven tech\u2019s innovation engine\nthroughout the 21st century\u2014won\u2019t be upset by the odd state actor, or by\nmalicious spam, or whatever scary new thing The Register is up in arms about\ntomorrow. It can only be disrupted when the community comes to believe\nmaintaining that balance is more trouble than it\u2019s worth. That\u2019s the threat we\nshould all be concerned about.\n\n##\n\nGood Sponsored Thing\n\nPluralsight\u2019s Tech Skills Day is coming up on April 25th.
