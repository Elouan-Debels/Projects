Development\n\nby Kesha Hietala and Emina Torlak | on 08 APR 2024 | in Amazon Verified Permissions, Open Source, Security, Identity, & Compliance, Technical How-to | Permalink | Comments | Share\n\nSome software components are really important to get right, like your\napplication\u2019s access control policies and core business logic. There are a\ngrowing number of tools to help you verify the correctness of these components\nby leveraging automated reasoning. In developing Cedar, an open source\nauthorization policy language, we have found that the Lean proof assistant is\na great tool for verifying Cedar\u2019s correctness and security properties.\n\nOver the past 6 months, we built a formal model of Cedar in Lean, and proved\nthat Cedar\u2019s components satisfy key safety and security properties. Lean is a\nfull-featured programming language \u2014writing models and proofs is just like\nwriting code, but Lean checks your work to make sure your proofs are correct.\nLean is also extremely fast, allowing us to efficiently test our production\ncode (written in Rust) against the Lean models.\n\nUntil now, Lean has been used mostly by mathematicians to formalize complex\nmath proofs. But our experience shows it\u2019s also an excellent tool for proofs\nabout software correctness and security. In this post, we\u2019ll describe how we\nused Lean for Cedar, highlight some potential bumps in the road, and point to\nresources where you can learn more. We hope sharing our experience can guide\nyour next high-assurance software project!\n\n## A brief introduction to Cedar\n\nCedar is an open source language for writing authorization policies, which\ndevelopers can use to define and enforce permissions for their applications.\nTo understand how, imagine you\u2019re developing a cloud application for hosting\ndocuments in folders. You can use Cedar policies to restrict which users\n(\u201cprincipals\u201d) are allowed to view and edit (perform \u201cactions\u201d on) which\ndocuments and folders (\u201cresources\u201d). When a user tries to access a document or\nfolder, your application calls the Cedar authorizer to check if the access is\nallowed by the policies. Your Cedar policies are separate from your\napplication code, enabling you to update one without impacting the other.\n\nHere is an example Cedar policy that lets users perform any action on\ndocuments they own:\n\n    \n    \n    // The owner of a document can perform any action. permit ( principal, action, resource is Document) when { resource.owner == principal };\n\nCedar\n\nThis policy allows access depending on the resource\u2019s owner. The expression\nresource is Document checks that the resource is of type Document, which\nalways has the owner attribute.\n\nIn addition to permit policies, which grant permissions, Cedar also supports\nforbid policies, which remove permissions. For example, say that deleted\ndocuments are moved to a special \u201cTrash\u201d folder, and you want to ensure that\nusers can\u2019t edit deleted documents. You can do so with the following policy:\n\n    \n    \n    // Users can't edit documents in the Trash folder. forbid ( principal, action == Action::\"editDoc\", resource in Folder::\"Trash\");\n\nCedar\n\nHere, resource in Folder::\"Trash\" means that the resource is contained in the\n\u201cTrash\u201d folder, either directly or in a deleted subfolder. This policy\nprevents everyone, including document owners, from editing deleted documents.\nThat\u2019s because forbids override permits: If a request satisfies both a permit\npolicy (because the principal owns the document) and a forbid policy (because\nthe document is deleted), the forbid always wins.\n\nThe Cedar SDK consists of three core components: the evaluator, the\nauthorizer, and the validator. The evaluator determines the value of\nexpressions like resource.owner == principal, and the authorizer applies the\nevaluator to your policies to decide whether a request should be allowed. The\nvalidator rules out certain classes of evaluation errors by typechecking\npolicies when you create them. For example, in the first policy above, the\nvalidator knows that the access resource.owner will never result in an error\nbecause resource is guaranteed to be of type Document.\n\n## How Cedar uses Lean for verification-guided development\n\nTo assure developers that Cedar is correct and secure, we build it using a\nprocess called verification-guided development. This process has two parts.\nFirst, we create an executable formal model of each core component in Lean.\nThe model is a highly readable prototype, and with it we prove key correctness\nproperties using Lean\u2019s proof assistant. You construct proofs in Lean by\napplying tactics \u2014 procedures that transform one state of the proof (known\nfacts) into another (implied facts). Lean checks each step, preventing\nmistakes.\n\nSecond, we implement Cedar\u2019s production code in Rust, optimizing for\nperformance and usability. We confirm that the code matches the model by using\ndifferential random testing. This involves generating millions of random\ninputs and checking that both model and code produce the same output on every\ninput. A new version of Cedar isn\u2019t released unless its model, proofs, and\ndifferential tests are up to date.\n\nWe adopted Lean to write our model because of its fast runtime, extensive\nlibraries, and small trusted computing base (TCB). The fast runtime enables\nefficient differential testing of Cedar models. The libraries provide reusable\nverified data structures and tactics built by the open source community.\nLean\u2019s small TCB also lets us leverage these contributions without having to\ntrust that they are correct \u2014 Lean checks that they are, and we only need to\ntrust Lean\u2019s minimal proof-checking kernel.\n\n## A quick tour of modeling and verifying Cedar with Lean\n\nWe model Cedar components as Lean functions. For example, here is the\nauthorizer:\n\n    \n    \n    def isAuthorized (req : Request) (entities : Entities) (policies : Policies) : Response := let forbids := satisfiedPolicies .forbid policies req entities let permits := satisfiedPolicies .permit policies req entities if forbids.isEmpty && !permits.isEmpty then { decision := .allow, policies := permits } else { decision := .deny, policies := forbids }\n\nCedar\n\nThe authorizer first computes the set of all satisfied forbid and permit\npolicies. It returns allow only if there are no satisfied forbids and there is\nat least one satisfied permit.\n\nThe authorizer code denies access if a forbid policy is satisfied. Proving\nthis property in Lean requires stating it as a theorem and providing a formal\nproof:\n\n    \n    \n    theorem forbid_trumps_permit (request : Request) (entities : Entities) (policies : Policies) : (\u2203 (policy : Policy), policy \u2208 policies \u2227 policy.effect = forbid \u2227 satisfied policy request entities) \u2192 (isAuthorized request entities policies).decision = deny := by intro h unfold isAuthorized simp [if_satisfied_then_satisfiedPolicies_non_empty forbid policies request entities h]\n\nCedar\n\nThe theorem (the part prior to the :=) says the following: if a collection of\npolicies contains a forbid that is satisfied by a given request and entities,\nthen calling isAuthorized on these inputs always returns deny.\n\nProof of this theorem (the part after the :=) is a series of steps showing the\nconclusion follows from the premises. Here, the premise is a satisfied forbid\npolicy, and the conclusion is the authorizer denying access. The proof applies\ntactics to transform the premise into the conclusion. The intro tactic adds\nthe premise to the proof state; unfold inlines the authorizer definition; and\nsimp uses an auxiliary theorem to complete the proof.\n\nLean helps you develop proofs interactively. The IDE shows you the proof state\nat each tactic application, and Lean checks that you\u2019re applying the tactics\ncorrectly. But you need to figure out which tactics to apply at each step to\nreach the goal. Writing Lean proofs is similar to how programming: tools give\nyou insight into the program state, and you write the steps to transform the\ninputs into the desired outputs.\n\nOnce you learn common tactics, Lean proofs are quick to develop, extend, and\nmaintain. The following table compares our modeling and proof effort in Lean\nto our implementation effort in Rust, measured in lines of code (LOC):\n\nComponent| Lean model (LOC)| Lean proofs (LOC)| Rust production code (LOC)  \n---|---|---|---  \nCustom sets and maps| 244| 681| N/A  \nEvaluator and Authorizer| 897| 347| 13664  \nValidator| 532| 4686| 11251  \nTotal| 1673| 5714| 24915  \n  \nOur most complex proof establishes the soundness of Cedar\u2019s validator \u2014 if the\nvalidator accepts a policy, evaluating the policy won\u2019t result in a type\nerror. At 4,686 lines of code, this proof took 18 person-days to develop.\nOther proofs were much smaller and even faster to write.\n\nThanks to Lean\u2019s libraries and features like type classes, our models are\nhighly readable and concise. For example, the validator model is 10X smaller\nthan its corresponding Rust implementation, which includes many test cases and\nextra code to provide useful diagnostic output. This makes the Lean models\nuseful not only for proofs but also as a form of documentation. They provide a\ncompact yet precise specification of Cedar for both Cedar users and\ndevelopers.\n\nOne challenge of using Lean is its strict termination checking. Lean requires\nall recursive definitions to be well-founded \u2014 basically, to bottom out. This\nrequirement can complicate modeling of complex recursive structures. For\nexample, Rust lets us represent Cedar values as a recursive datatype over\nbuilt-in sets and maps. Lean prohibits this for the standard set and map data\ntypes because their invariants introduce circular (not well-founded)\nreasoning. We worked around this by developing custom set and map data types\nthat replace embedded invariants with separate theorems. Working with the\ntermination checker takes some getting used to, but it eventually becomes\nsecond nature, and the payoff is that you know your code is free of infinite\nloops.\n\nLean models are fast to execute and proofs are fast to check. On average, Lean\ntakes 5 microseconds to evaluate a differential testing input, compared to 7\nmicroseconds for Rust. These fast execution times allow us to run millions of\ntest cases nightly to compare the model against the production code. Lean\nchecks individual proofs interactively as you\u2019re working on them, providing\ninstantaneous feedback. It takes 185 seconds in total to check all proofs and\ncompile models for execution. This is pretty fast! As a point of comparison,\nRust takes 45 seconds to compile and test the implementation code.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nWe\u2019ve found Lean to be a great tool for verified software development. You get\na full-featured programming language, fast proof checker and runtime, and a\nfamiliar way to build both models and proofs \u2014 by writing programs. If you try\nit, keep these tips in mind:\n\nLean into the curve. Proof assistants like Lean have a steep learning curve.\nYou need to learn which tactics to use, and when and how to use them. With\npractice, proof development becomes an efficient engineering activity, like\nprogramming. Proofs are programs in Lean, after all.\n\nStart simple. Tactics and syntax are also programmable. You can write your own\ntactics, define custom syntax, and embed whole languages in Lean. Start\nsimple: Customize Lean\u2019s simp tactic with auxiliary theorems tailored to your\nproofs, and define your own notation for key operators. Simple code and proofs\nare easier to build and maintain.\n\nStay flexible. Lean may not let you write code as you would in other\nlanguages. For example, you may need to adjust how you define a data structure\nor recursive function to satisfy the termination checker. There are still some\nsmall challenges with Lean, such as its sparse documentation and sluggish\ntermination checking for mutual induction. But the community is constantly\nimproving it, and you can always find a way forward.\n\n## Learn more\n\nThis post explored how we use Lean for verification-guided development of\nCedar. Lean\u2019s language enables concise modeling of Cedar components. Its proof\nassistant enables fast proof development and verification. And Lean\u2019s runtime\nsupports efficient differential testing against the models.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to try Lean for your own verification efforts, lean into the\nlearning curve, start simple, and stay flexible! It can be rewarding and a lot\nof fun.\n\nTo learn more about Lean and Cedar:\n\n  * Check out the Lean proof assistant and join the thriving community around it.\n  * Try out Cedar policies in the online playground.\n  * Explore Cedar\u2019s Lean models and differential testing framework on GitHub.\n  * Join the Cedar Slack channel to connect with the team.\n  * Check out a Cedar demo and talk to our team in the AWS booth at Open Source Summit in Seattle on April 16-18, 2024.\n\n### Kesha Hietala\n\nKesha Hietala is an Applied Scientist in the Automated Reasoning in Identity\nGroup at AWS, where she focuses on developing the Cedar language.
