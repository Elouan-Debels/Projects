In March, bankruptcy\nproceedings were initiated against BHBV for the second time, in the same\nmonth, Ben Hermans had already initiated the founding of a new company with\nthe same name.As BHBV has not published any statutory annual reports since\n2021, it is currently unclear whether the company still holds the majority of\nshares in Hyperion. Ben Hermans has not responded to an inquiry from amiga-\nnews.de; the appointed liquidator Charlotte Piers tells us she'll get back to\nus in the next few days with \"a more detailed response\".Friday's edition of\nthe Belgian Official Gazette (local copy) now contains the information that\ninsolvency lawyer Bart De Moor has been appointed \"voorlopig bewindvoerder\"\nfor Hyperion Entertainment. Machine translation tools turn \"bewindvoerder\"\ninto \"administrator\" - but as native Dutch speakers tell us, a more accurate\ntranslation would be \"receiver\".It is currently unclear who appointed De Moor\nas liquidator - if he had been appointed by BHBV's liquidator, this would be a\nclear indication that Hyperion Entertainment is part of BHBV's bankruptcy\nestate. We have asked Bart De Moor for confirmation and will update this news\nitem accordingly should he respond to our questions. (cg) (Translation:\ncg)[News message: 08.
