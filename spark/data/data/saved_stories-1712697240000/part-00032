If you do not sign in, your notes will remain local to your device.\nIf you want to sync your notes across devices, you can sign up for an account,\nand UpNote will store your notes on a central server so they can be synced to\nother devices.\n\nYou have complete control over your data, and we would never access your data\nor sell your data to third parties. For more information about your privacy,\nplease read our Privacy Policy.\n\n### Where is the UpNote server located? Is it secure?\n\nUpNote stores data on the Firebase server (which is a service provided by\nGoogle). The Firebase platform is certified to major privacy and security\nstandards and fully supports the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nand the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Firebase encrypts your data in\ntransit using HTTPS and encrypts your data at rest. You can learn more at\nhttps://firebase.google.com/support/privacy. We also take great care to ensure\nthat your data is secure and only you can access it.\n\n### Does UpNote support storing data on iCloud?\n\nUpNote is designed to work on all platforms, including Windows, Linux, and\nAndroid. However, since iCloud currently only supports Apple devices, UpNote\ncannot support iCloud for syncing notes.\n\n### Since Firebase is a Google service, can Google use my note content for\nadvertising purposes?\n\nNo. Firebase data is not shared or used by Google for advertising purposes.\nMany companies use cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS),\nMicrosoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform to process user data, and these\nservices are separate from the service owner's primary business. UpNote does\nnot include Google Analytics in our applications, so your activity is not\ntracked on any platform.\n\n### Does UpNote support end-to-end encryption?\n\nEnd-to-End Encryption (E2EE) is an advanced security method for encrypting and\ndecrypting data and is designed to protect highly confidential information.\nDue to the complexity of implementation, UpNote currently has no plans to\nsupport E2EE. If you wish to store sensitive information such as passwords or\ncredit card numbers, it is recommended that you use a password manager\napplication specifically designed to encrypt sensitive information.\n\n### Does UpNote support multi-factor authentication (MFA)?\n\nYes, you can use the \"Sign in with Google\" or \"Sign in with Apple\" method when\ncreating or signing in to your UpNote account. These methods support MFA by\ndefault.\n\nIf you currently sign in to your account using email and password, you can\nchange your sign-in method to \"Sign in with Google\" or \"Sign in with Apple\" to\nuse MFA (please go to Settings \u2192 My Account \u2192 Manage Sign-in Method). For\nsecurity reasons, please sign in again on any other device after changing your\nsign-in method.\n\n### How do I change my email or password?\n\nYou can change your email or password at any time by going to the Settings\nscreen and navigating to the Account section. For security reasons, changing\nyour email and password will log you out of other devices, and you will need\nto sign in again with the new email and password to sync your notes.\n\n### Do I need to verify my email address?\n\nVerifying your email address helps secure your account. It prevents others\nfrom using your email address to sign up for an account and helps you recover\nyour account if you accidentally forget your password.\n\n### How do I delete my account?\n\nTo delete your account, please log into the UpNote app on any platform and go\nto Settings \u2192 Account \u2192 Delete Account. This action will immediately delete\nyour account and all associated data from the server and cannot be undone.\n\n## Premium\n\n### How do I get UpNote premium?\n\nYou can upgrade to Premium on the Mac, iOS, or Android app. Upgrading on one\ndevice will cover all of your devices.

Just sign in\nto your UpNote account to sync your premium.\n\n### How do I switch from a monthly subscription to a lifetime upgrade?\n\nYou can switch from a monthly subscription to a lifetime upgrade from the\nPremium screen (go to Settings \u2192 Premium). The app will first ask you to\ncancel your existing subscription to avoid being charged twice, and then let\nyou purchase a lifetime upgrade.\n\n### How long does my lifetime plan last?\n\nWe currently offer the lifetime plan option for UpNote. Even if we have to\nswitch to a full subscription model, we will still honor lifetime licenses and\nlifetime users will be able to use all existing premium features.\n\n### I don\u2019t see an option to upgrade on Windows and Linux apps. What can I do?\n\nUpgrading to Premium is not yet available for Windows and Linux applications.\nHowever, if you have a Mac, iOS, or Android device, you can upgrade to Premium\nthere and sync your Premium with your Windows and Linux applications.\n\n### I\u2019m concerned about the sustainability of UpNote, especially with the\nlifetime plan option.\n\nUpNote\u2019s lean model allows us to create efficient development cycles while\noptimizing costs to offer an affordable premium plan to our users. Currently,\nUpNote limits each attachment to 20MB and reduce the image resolution when\nuploading to UpNote to reduce our server costs.\n\nWe are constantly monitoring our costs and will make adjustments as needed to\nensure the long-term growth of the application.
