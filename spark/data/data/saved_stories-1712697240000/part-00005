While it\u2019s easy to associate the stringed toy with that\nera, the historic gadget also had its place among 18th-century French\naristocrats (Napoleon used one, too). It was this drastically different\ninspiration that influenced the development of Penny's Big Breakaway, the most\ninventive platformer of the year.\n\nFor years, even before the studio\u2019s founding in 2018, the team at Evening Star\nStudio toyed with the idea of using a yo-yo in a video game. This seed of an\nidea popped up once again as the team was putting together ideas for its next\ngame following their smash-hit Sonic Mania.\n\n\u201cWhile we were brainstorming, the yo-yo idea just popped up again, and people\non our team started riffing back and forth. I think a lot of people saw the\npotential: You could do a lot of things with this, if you use it as the main\ncrux of the game concept,\u201d game director Hunter Bridges tells Inverse, \u201cOnce\nwe started looking it up, we started finding all these like hilarious\nillustrations of French aristocracy from like the 18th century playing with\nyo-yos. That actually informed some of the world and character design.\u201d\n\nEvening Star drew a ton of inspiration from the history of yo-yos with French\naristocracy, and the team referenced this specific picture.\n\nMuseum of Yo-Yo History\n\nIn Penny\u2019s Big Breakaway, you play as Penny, a street performer living in\ncolorful Vanillatown. Penny uses her yo-yo skills to audition for a spot in\nEmperor Eddie's court, but things go awry after she discovers a Cosmic String\nthat turns her yo-yo into a ravenously hungry sentient being. The platforming\nin Penny is all about building and gaining momentum, using the character\u2019s\nunique yo-yo skills to move through levels as quickly as possible.\n\nBut while the yo-yo (and its 18th-century popularity among French nobility)\ninspired much of the game\u2019s charming quirkiness, it also also gave Evening\nStar Studio a surprising amount of freedom to try out new ideas.\n\n\u201cIt's not like one of us was a pro yo-yoer in college, and now it's our dream\nto make a yo-yo game,\u201d Bridges says, \u201cWe thought this was an interesting\nartifact and thought it had a lot of potential and a lot of depth to it,\nespecially from the surrounding history and culture. What ways have people\nplayed with yo-yos in the past? How has this evolved, and how can we kind of\nincorporate that into the game concept?\u201d\n\n> \u201cI don't like using bottomless pits.\u201d\n\nFrom the start, Bridges and the rest of the team knew they wanted to make a 3D\ngame and wanted a \u201ccommon thread\u201d with their past work, resulting in a\nmomentum-based platformer. But as it turns out, making the jump from Sonic\nMania\u2019s two dimensions to Penny\u2019s three can be difficult. For design director\nBrad Flick that even resulted in a basic question to start: \u201cDoes my approach\nto making levels translate to three dimensions?\u201d The game speaks for itself,\nbut only after Flick was able to rethink a lot of core game design elements.\n\n\u201cFor example, in 2D, I don't like using bottomless pits. I don't find a need\nfor them when I can make several other interesting scenarios,\u201d Flick tells\nInverse. \u201cBut with 3D, the \u2018void\u2019 is unavoidable. The bottomless pit is the\nenemy in the game.\n\nEnemy design also requires a drastic shift in perspective.\n\n\u201cYou look at Mario and the Goomba,\u201d he says. \u201cThe perfect enemy in 2D, but in\n3D you can just walk around them.\u201d\n\nPenny\u2019s Big Breakaway emulates the big three-dimensional jump platformers as a\nwhole went through in the \u201890s.\n\nNintendo\n\nThat problem with the bottomless pit led to a \u201chyper-focus\u201d on Penny\u2019s\nrelationship with the ground, which then tied into the game\u2019s overall emphasis\non momentum. The core of the whole system comes down to how much time Penny\nspends in the air. The more momentum you build on the ground, the longer\namount of airtime you\u2019re able to achieve.\n\nThere\u2019s another key inspiration that allowed Evening Star to take this idea\neven further: Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater and skateboarding in general.\n\n\u201cAs you become more experienced as a skateboarder, you gain the ability to\nlook at the environment and see the tricks that you can do. You can start\nseeing the path that you're going to take when you skate a course,\u201d Bridges\nsays, \u201cWe wanted to build that same sense in the player with Penny. We don't\nnecessarily want to create a game where you feel like you have to memorize\nevery corner in order to optimize your run through a level, we more wanted to\ngive the player an opportunity to get a lay of the land and then chart your\nown course. See the whole thing at a glance and be able to figure that out.\u201d\n\nBeing able to see the entire level sprawl out in front of you was the core\ndifference in transitioning to 3D, and Evening Star quickly learned that Penny\nshould play into that idea. Of course, the yo-yo itself and the tricks Penny\ncan do are a vital part of building and maintaining that momentum.\n\nMischievous Penguins chase you in Penny, and according to Bridges, the little\nguys took a lot of trial and error to get right. In the future Bridges wants\nto experiment more with \u201cnonviolent\u201d gameplay and enemies.\n\nEvening Star Studio\n\nEarly on in development, the team toyed around with more unique ideas on how\nto use the yo-yo, particularly in ways that Penny would separate herself from\nthe object. This included using the yo-yo as a tightrope between two\nlocations, or charging up for an extra long throw. Flick says the team\nrealized, however, that many of these options were simply too slow, and worked\nagainst the game\u2019s core idea of speed. Because of that, they decided that\nPenny would always have the yo-yo in her hand for everything, and while the\nstring itself would be animated to make things feel dynamic, it wouldn\u2019t\ninteract with the environment.\n\nInterestingly, though, a big factor in how the yo-yo was implemented came down\nto a single move, with how Penny uses the yo-yo to swing in mid-air.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it, when you jump in the air, and then you want to do the\nswing, if the yo-yo string is longer than your jump height, then as soon as\nyou swing, you're just going to hit the ground again,\u201d Flick remarks, \u201cSo we\nhad to have a string length that was shorter than your default jump height.\nThere's a very subtle difference where if you throw the yo-yo on the ground,\nit goes slightly further, because we had to trim the air throw a little bit\njust to tune the swing.\u201d\n\nThese kinds of small lessons compounded to make Penny what it is today, and\nit\u2019s abundantly clear that this has been a learning process for everyone at\nEvening Star. That journey doesn\u2019t just apply to the developers, though, as\nit\u2019s equally important for the players that pick up Penny, a platformer quite\ndifferent from anything else out there.\n\n\u201cFor me, a lot of the learnings from a game design perspective have come out\nof how we made active choices to challenge people's preconceived notions, or\nchallenge people's expectations of the genre,\u201d Bridges says, \u201cWe did that with\nthe fixed camera, and with deprioritizing combat. We learned that if you're\ngoing to challenge players' expectations in that way, then you kind of have to\nwork double in order to educate the player and justify why their expectations\nare being challenged.\u201d\n\nIf Evening Star ever makes another game with a yo-yo, Bridges and Flick say\nit\u2019d be a puzzle game.\n\nPenny's Big Breakaway\n\nIn Bridges' mind, the studio could have done a better job of explaining\nelements of the game, but it was a tough balance to find. That\u2019s one of many\nlessons the team has taken to heart and hopes to implement moving forward. In\nterms of learning lessons, though, that might be a key part of what makes\nPenny\u2019s Big Breakaway feel so unique.\n\nWhile I mentioned at the start that Evening Star wasn\u2019t directly trying to\nevoke the \u201890s with Penny, Bridges does think there might be something more to\nthat association.\n\n> \u201cWe're trying to be different.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's an element of jumping from our previous work into this, where we kind\nof have taken the transition from 2D to 3D in a way that parallels what a lot\nof developers were doing in the mid-90\u2019s. Rediscovering and walking those\ntrails ourselves, instead of just starting in the modern era with everything\nthat people are equipped with now\u201d Bridges tells Inverse, \u201cWhich I think\nresults in it sort of echoing some of that era.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a hope that Penny can be one of many games heralding a shift in\nthe genre at large, with a growing groundswell of indie developers bringing\nunique ideas to 3D platformers. The chance to bring a fresh idea to the 3D\nplatformer was tantalizing for the team at Evening Star, especially when the\ngenre is largely dominated by Nintendo these days.\n\nPenny\u2019s world and aesthetic of Penny was also inspired by the German \u201cBauhaus\u201d\nstyle.\n\nPenny's Big Breakaway\n\nThe team at Evening Star knows that Penny might not appeal to everyone, but\ntrying to do something new and different was the most important factor. And if\nthat inspires someone else down the road? All the better. Video games\nconstantly need to level up.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is that people continue to try new things, because if\nyou're just trying to emulate what's come before, or you're just trying to be\nlike Mario, for example, then people can just go play Mario, right?\u201d Bridges\nsays. \u201cWe're trying to be different in the space.\u201d\n\n#### Penny\u2019s Big Breakaway is available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo\nSwitch, and PC.\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * Video Games\n  * PlayStation\n  * Nintendo\n\n", "frontpage": false}
