Table of contents below. I want to especially highlight\nthree things.\n\nFirst, Saar wrote a response to my post (and to zoonosis arguments in\ngeneral). I\u2019ve put a summary and some my responses at 1.11, but you can read\nthe full post on the Rootclaim blog.\n\nSecond, I kind of made fun of Peter for giving some very extreme odds, and I\nmentioned they were sort of trolling, but he\u2019s convinced me they were 100%\ntrolling. Many people held these poorly-done calculations against Peter, so I\nwant to make it clear that\u2019s my fault for mis-presenting it. See 3.1 for more\ndetails.\n\nThird, in my original post, I failed to mention that Peter also has a blog,\nincluding a post summing up his COVID origins argument.\n\nThanks to some people who want to remain anonymous for helping me with this\npost.

It\u2019s a coronavirus discovered in 2004 that\nseems to have spilled over in China and spread globally (it\u2019s fine; it just\ncauses yet another subtype of common cold). The exact animal reservoir has\nnever been identified, although Wikipedia says it \u201clikely originated from\nrodents\u201d.\n\nThe classic case where we did find infected animals was SARS (which came from\ncivets). It took six months of careful research. Most of the civet farms and\ncivet wet markets were negative. Even at farms with some positive civets,\nother civets were negative. Twenty years later, it\u2019s still not obvious civets\nwere the definitive intermediate host, rather than some other animal that got\ncaught in the crossfire.\n\nMeanwhile, a few weeks after COVID was discovered, China killed all the\nanimals in the market without testing any raccoon-dogs for COVID. Then they\ntold all nearby raccoon-dog farms to kill all their raccoon-dogs too. Then\nthey banned Chinese scientists from researching the origins of COVID. Probably\nthis is part of why we eventually found an intermediate host for SARS1 and not\nCOVID.\n\nSimon objects that although it was hard to find the exact civets responsible\nfor SARS, we did later find that lots of civet handlers had SARS antibodies\n(even though they didn\u2019t remember getting sick).\n\n> There's different types of evidence for infected civets, some of which comes\n> from higher seroprevalence among civet traders.\n>\n> In May 2003, Guan et al (2003) identified SARS-CoV-like virus in animals in\n> a live-animal market in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China.

During the debate, Peter said that if we\nhad tested lots of raccoon-dog handlers using the Guan et al methodology, we\nmight have found they also had COVID antibodies. Unfortunately nobody did, and\nit\u2019s too late, because by now the raccoon-dog handlers have probably gotten\nCOVID the normal way.\n\n###\n\n1.2: Were the raccoon-dogs wild-caught?\n\nSimon stats wrote:\n\n> What you say about raccoon dogs here is mistaken. Raccoon dogs are not a\n> plausible intermediate host for sars-cov-2 on the basis of information that\n> has been known since 2021. There are several considerations.\n>\n> 1\\. Xiao et al (2021) -\n> https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91470-2%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B\n> , which includes a co-author of Worobey et al (2022), a leading zoonosis\n> paper states in table 1 that the raccoon dogs were wild caught in Hubei, not\n> farmed as you assert in the piece. This alone rules out raccoon dogs as\n> plausible hosts for two independently sufficient reasons. Firstly, there is\n> unanimity in the literature that the bat ancestral virus to SARS-CoV-2 is in\n> southern Yunnan or South East Asia. Everyone agrees with this, including Shi\n> Zhengli. If a species was wild caught in Hubei, then there would be no\n> explanation of how it acquired the ancestral bat virus, given that Hubei is\n> 1000 miles from southern Yunnan.\n>\n> Secondly, a mystery of sars-cov-2 is how it acquired the furin cleavage site\n> that makes it so transmissible.

Wang et al (2022)\n> https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/8/1/veac046/6601809 also confirms that\n> the raccoon dogs were wild caught in Hubei. What's more, Wang et al (2022)\n> tested 15 wild raccoon dogs of suppliers of Wuhan markets, including the\n> Huanan market, in January 2020 and found them to be negative for SARS-CoV-2.\n> On average, 38 raccoon dogs were sold across the four markets in Wuhan from\n> 2017 to 2019. So, the 15 raccoon dogs likely comprised nearly the whole\n> inventory of raccoon dogs that would have been supplied to the Huanan market\n> at the time [...]\n>\n> Xiao et al (2021) has a list of species sold at the Huanan market. I would\n> encourage you to read that list and suggest which animals you think are\n> plausible, and I will tell you why they are not actually plausible.\n\nXiao (2021) Table 1 only says that some raccoon dogs in Wuhan had wounds,\nsuggesting they were wild-caught. It makes no claims that all raccoon-dogs\nwere wild-caught. There are dozens of raccoon-dog farms in the same province\nas Wuhan.\n\nIIUC Wang (2022) says that 38 raccoon dogs were sold in Wuhan per month, not\n38 during the whole two-year study period, so the claim that the traders in\nWang represent the whole supply fails.\n\nThe raccoon dogs were tested for active infection, not serology, so you would\nhave had to catch a raccoon-dog in the act of having COVID to see anything.\nRemember, during SARS, scientists kept testing the farms that supplied the wet\nmarkets where it was spilling over, and most farms were negative.\n\nThe wildlife trade in China is complicated, and sometimes involves a permeable\nbarrier between farm and wilderness. Farmed and wild animals are kept in the\nsame pens, packed in the same crates, and sold at the same stalls.\n\nSuppose you know that one of the animals in the middle crate on the right was\ncaught in some safe, disease-free way, 500 km away, three months ago. How\nconfident does that make you feel?\n\nTo answer the question about which animals in the Xiao paper are plausible: at\nleast civets and bamboo rats. SARS spread back and forth in some kind of weird\nnet between civets, raccoon dogs, and a bunch of made-up-sounding animals like\n\"ferret-badgers\" and \"greater hog-badgers\". For all we know, COVID could have\ndone likewise.\n\nIf all of this sounds desperate and wishy-washy, imagine an alien who comes to\nEarth, hangs out at Area 51, and catches COVID. She theorizes that she got it\nfrom humans. She\u2019s heard that the humans at Area 51 came from schools, so she\nabducts fifteen humans from a nearby school and gives them COVID throat swabs.\nNone of them are positive, so she announces that humans can\u2019t be a COVID\nintermediate host. Other aliens suggest further testing, but she has already\nvaporized Earth, just in case, so the further testing never gets done.\n\nSimon added:\n\n> Even the strongest proponents of the raccoon dog hypothesis have walked back\n> their bold claims that raccoon dogs are the host.\n\nI asked a scientist whose name is on some of the original raccoon-dog papers\nif this was true. He said:\n\n> I secretly root for other intermediate hosts. Bamboo rats or civets would be\n> really fascinating and have flown under the radar. But it\u2019s been really hard\n> to bet against raccoon dogs. First we learn they can transmit and the virus\n> didn\u2019t change when transmitted between them (Freuling 2020)? Then turns out\n> they\u2019re sold in the market (Xiao 2021)? Then it turns out they\u2019re freaking\n> everywhere in the genetic data from the market, the most common mammal\n> detected? Then it turns out the market animals aren\u2019t from northern China\n> fur farms? It\u2019s been a tough road for those betting against them....\n\n###\n\n1.3: 92 Early Cases\n\nThere was a long multi-branching thread of arguments centered around 92 early\ncases, for example here:\n\nMy understanding of the situation: the first officially-confirmed case of\nCOVID started December 11, 2019. Later in the pandemic, in 2021, the World\nHealth Organization wanted to figure out if that was really the first, or\nwhether there had been earlier ones. They scoured Chinese hospital records for\nillnesses that might be COVID during the two months before the official\ndiscovery (ie early October to early December) In particular, they asked Wuhan\nhospitals for records of any cases of fever, flu, respiratory illness, and\npneumonia. The hospital gave them 76,253 cases, because China is big and flu\nis common. This was slightly more cases than usual, but there was a normal flu\nspreading too, so the researchers didn\u2019t find this very compelling.\n\nThen they narrowed these cases down to those that were \u201cclinically compatible\u201d\nwith COVID, and ended up with 92.\n\nThen they went over those 92 more carefully, including \u201creview by the external\nmultidisciplinary clinical team\u201d and blood draws from the former patients.\nThey were able to track down 67 of the 92. The clinical team decided none of\nthose 92 cases really resembled COVID, and the blood draws were all negative.\nThey published this as the results of their study:\n\n> The retrospective search for cases compatible with COVID-19 illness\n> identified 76 253 episodes with one of four indicator conditions. A rise in\n> one of these conditions, [acute respiratory illness] (as well as [flu-like\n> illness] and fever), was seen in this group of individuals in the\n> over-60-year age group in early December. The clinical assessment of the\n> 76,253 individuals revealed 92 cases clinically compatible with COVID-19. It\n> is possible that the application of stringent clinical criteria, resulting\n> in the identification of only 92 clinically compatible cases, may have\n> decreased the possibility of identifying a group or groups of cases with\n> milder illness. All the 92 cases were rejected as cases of SARS-CoV-2\n> infection on further clinical review.\n>\n> None of these cases (where blood could be obtained) was positive on SARS-\n> CoV-2 serological testing carried out more than 12 months later. The use of\n> retrospective serological testing so long after the illness cannot be relied\n> on to exclude the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of the\n> presenting illness, given the possible drop in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody\n> over time and the associated reduced sensitivity of commercial assays. The\n> possibility that earlier transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection was occurring\n> in this community cannot be excluded on the basis of this evidence.\n\nIn other words \u201cwe looked for early COVID, we didn\u2019t find any, but we can\u2019t\npromise we didn\u2019t miss anything\u201d.\n\nOn Twitter, Giles Demaneuf makes an interesting point. The researchers took\nthe samples in 2021, when China was in Zero COVID. When the Wuhan outbreak was\nfinally contained in early 2020, 4.4% of Wuhanites had contracted COVID. So\nisn\u2019t it surprising that 0/67 of the former patients who the researchers\ntested were had antibodies to COVID? The chance that 67 randomly-selected\npeople in a population with 4.4% prevalence rate are all negative is only\nabout 5%. Is this evidence of foul play?\n\nNo. See the conclusions section of the report, which said: \u201cThe use of\nretrospective serological testing so long after the illness cannot be relied\non to exclude the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of the\npresenting illness, given the possible drop in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody\nover time and the associated reduced sensitivity of commercial assays\u201d.\n\nYou have a lot of COVID antibodies just after getting COVID. By a year or so\nafterwards, you might not have enough to detect. So it\u2019s not surprising the\nWHO study didn\u2019t detect any.\n\nWhy did they even try looking for antibodies? There seem to be two reasons not\nto: first, they should have known antibodies would decay after a year. Second,\neven if some of them did have antibodies, how would we know they weren\u2019t just\ninfected in spring 2020 like everyone else?\n\nThey don\u2019t say. My guess: antibody decay is very variable. Some people\u2019s\nantibodies might last more than a year. So if they found that way more than\n4.4% of people had antibodies, that would be surprising and suggest that most\nof them had had COVID in autumn 2019. But instead they found that nobody had\nantibodies, which is consistent with one or two of them getting sick when\neveryone else got sick, and having their antibodies decay at the normal rate.\nBut also, I think the antibodies were just intended to supplement the clinical\nreview, and not be a very important part of their determination.\n\nI think this study is moderately strong evidence that there wasn\u2019t much COVID\ngoing around before December 2019. Doctors looked for cases, they winnowed\nthem down into the cases that looked most like COVID, but when they examined\nthose cases closely, they didn\u2019t look enough like COVID to be interesting. I\ndon\u2019t think the antibody tests add or subtract much from this assessment.\n\nI would be fine if someone else said they don\u2019t think the WHO report provides\nmuch evidence either way. The main thing I want to insist on is that there\u2019s\nno conspiracy to hide 92 previously-undiscovered cases. They searched really\nhard for potential cases, they subjected the most plausible candidates for\nfurther review, and then they decided those ones were not, in fact, COVID.\n\n(You can read all of this here. It\u2019s not a very good description and I\u2019d be\ninterested if someone has a more thorough writeup of the research.)\n\nThis was just one of many efforts that researchers made to try to identify\npre-December-2020 COVID cases. For example, 30,000 people donated blood in\nautumn 2019, and the hospitals still had most of it. So they tested the blood\nsamples for COVID antibodies and didn\u2019t find any. I don\u2019t think antibodies\ndecay in stored blood samples (I might be wrong). There are 12 million people\nin Wuhan, so if even a few hundred people had COVID during that time, one of\nthem should have turned up. None of them did.\n\nFinally, during COVID\u2019s officially-recognized existence, its numbers doubled\nabout once every 3.5 days. Again, if COVID existed a month earlier than\npreviously believed, then it would be 256x more common than expected. This\nwould be hard to miss! Nobody found evidence from excess mortality that COVID\nwas 256x more common than expected.\n\nI\u2019m using the version of the doubling time argument because it\u2019s simple enough\nfor me to understand, and I don\u2019t have to worry about anyone trying to hide\nsomething in their complex model. It\u2019s not exactly true, but it\u2019s true enough\nto rule out COVID starting much before November 2019. If you want the fancy\nofficial version, it\u2019s in Pekar 2021 and looks like this:\n\nThis alone isn\u2019t fatal to lab leak. It\u2019s perfectly possible for the lab to\nleak (let\u2019s say) November 5th, the virus spreads a bit, and then a month later\nsomeone goes to the wet market, coughs on a vendor, and starts the officially\nrecognized pandemic.\n\nBut if that were true, you\u2019d expect (let\u2019s say) 30 cases by early December.\nLet\u2019s say the wet market vendor was exactly Case # 30. She infected the other\nwet market vendors, starting a pandemic with an obvious center at the wet\nmarket and lots of infected wet market vendors and patrons. What about Case #\n29? If they were (let\u2019s say) a barista, how come they didn\u2019t infect people at\ntheir coffee shop? How come there wasn\u2019t a second obvious cluster radiating\nout from a coffee shop, lots of coffee-shop-linked cases, etc? How come there\nweren\u2019t 30 equally-sized clusters?\n\nIn order to avoid this, you either need to claim that the wet market was a\nperfect superspreader location, or that the pattern with lots of cases in the\nwet market and few-to-none anywhere else was a result of ascertainment bias.\nSaar made both those arguments during the debate, but I thought Peter rebutted\nthem effectively.\n\n###\n\n1.4: COVID in Brazilian wastewater\n\nNicholas Halden (blog) writes:\n\nWhat should we make of this study, which found the presence of covid in\nBrazilian wastewater in late 2019?\n\nConsider the doubling times.\n\nThe study says that scientists working in late 2020 found COVID in samples of\nBrazilian wastewater from November 27, 2019. This was long before the first\ndetected case of transmission in Brazil on March 13, 2020.\n\nBetween November 27, 2019 and March 13, 2020 is about 16 weeks, so 32 COVID\ndoubling times. 32 doubling times with no lockdown is enough time for COVID to\ninfect every single person in Brazil. If COVID had infected everyone in Brazil\nbefore the first recognized case, we would have noticed.\n\n(again, COVID doubling time isn\u2019t exactly invariably 3.5 days, but here we\u2019re\ntalking about numbers big enough that the exact details don\u2019t matter very\nmuch)\n\nSo if COVID was in Brazil on November 27, it must have fizzled out instead of\ngoing pandemic. How likely is that? If one person had COVID, it\u2019s not too\nunlikely - not all COVID cases transmit it forward. If (let\u2019s say) twenty\npeople had COVID, it\u2019s very unlikely - at that point, the law of large numbers\ntakes over; in a freak coincidence, every single patient would have to fail to\ninfect anyone else. So almost certainly fewer than 20 people in Brazil had\nCOVID in November 27.\n\nSo which is more likely - that somehow 20 people had COVID long before the\nvirus was officially detected, and on a totally different continent, yet\nsomehow a scientist looking through wastewater found the water from exactly\nthose people and managed to detect the virus? Or that there was a sampling\nerror, which happens all the time in these kinds of things?\n\nPeter wrote a blog post on some of these issues. He found that there were\npositive tests from wastewater samples as early as March 2019, which doesn\u2019t\nfit anyone\u2019s timeline, including lab leakers\u2019. And most of these positives\n(including the Brazilian sample) contained later strains of the virus with\nmutations it picked up late in 2020. So these were almost certainly false\npositives from contamination.\n\n###\n\n1.5: Biorealism\u2019s 16 arguments\n\nBiorealism has a list of sixteen arguments, which he liked so much that he\nposted it three times in the ACX comments, twice on Less Wrong, twice on\nManifold, and about a dozen times on Twitter under multiple account names.\nSome posts were slightly different from others, but a typical version is:\n\n> Importantly, Miller incorrectly claimed the N501Y mutation would result from\n> passage in hACE2 mice (mixed them up with BALB/c mice). The major papers\n> Miller relied on have been seriously challenged since the debate. See Stoyan\n> and Chiu (2024), Weissman (2024), Bloom (2023) and Lv et al (2024). Overall\n> the circumstantial evidence makes lab v plausible:\n\nPeter admitted getting this wrong during the debate. I think this very minor\npoint about mice mutations was approximately his only mistake in 15 hours of\ndebating, and he admitted it as soon as he noticed. Biorealism somehow heard\nabout this (obviously not through watching the debate, as we\u2019ll see in a\nmoment), then left about 20-30 comments starting with it, under various\naccounts, on various platforms, as if it somehow discredited Peter. This is\nmaking me somewhat less charitable to him and his 16 arguments than I would be\notherwise.\n\n> 1\\.

The first two known Lineage A cases were\nvery close to the market. Lv (is this even a real name? It sounds like Roman\nnumeral? But I guess that\u2019s what you expect in a country ruled by someone\nnamed Xi) found some weird COVID variants in Shanghai that might or might not\nmean anything; you can see some discussion of the implications here, but I\ndon\u2019t think they\u2019re strong evidence either way. If A was first, it means some\nreally weird stuff coincidences have to happen to give us the spread rates and\ngenetic clock data we get, but they\u2019re not necessarily weirder in the zoonosis\nhypothesis than the lab leak one.\n\nThe claim that there were \u201cthousands of cases in Wuhan in December 2019\u201d is\nvery easy to disprove by doubling rate arguments like the one above, by the\nblood bank study mentioned above, by the WHO\u2019s failed case search, and by many\nother lines of argument.\n\n> 6\\.

A Western team re-analyzing the\nsame sample describes it as \u201cconclusively contain[ing] Lineage A.\u201d I think\nmost lab leakers have switched from trying to deny the genetics to claiming\nthat this was \u201ccontamination\u201d, which also doesn\u2019t make sense (the sample is\ngenetically very early). Note that aside from this sample, the first two\nLineage A cases discovered were both very close to the wet market.\n\n> 7\\. Bloom (2023) shows market samples do not support market origin.

In one analysis, they show that even\nthough the other paper\u2019s methodology is worse than theirs, if you apply it\ncorrectly (instead of inappropriately excluding various cases like the paper\u2019s\nauthors did), the center of all early cases in Hubei province lands on the wet\nmarket parking lot. In another analysis, they show that the other paper\u2019s\nrecommended tests wouldn\u2019t have correctly pointed to the offending water pump\nin the famous John Snow cholera outbreak, but theirs would have.\n\nStill, I think it\u2019s useful to supplement fancy statistics with normal common\nsense, so I recommend just looking at the map of early cases:\n\n...and deciding whether you think the assumptions behind a specific\nstatistical test are likely to debunk the idea that cases are centered around\nthe wet market.\n\n> 11\\.

Wuhan\nUniversity sequenced some rice. In the middle of the sequence, there\u2019s an\nunexpected sequence from a common coronavirus, HKU4. The most likely\nexplanation is that someone else in Wuhan was working on the coronavirus and\nthere was cross-contamination. Plausibly this is Wuhan Institute of Virology,\nwho is known to work with coronaviruses. This is cool detective work, but it\u2019s\nnot clear what it\u2019s supposed to prove. I think some lab leakers are using it\nto prove that WIV can do reverse genetics, but they admitted this already in a\npublished paper so that\u2019s not too helpful. I think others are using it to\nprove WIV had \u201csecret viruses\u201d in their catalogue, but the rice virus wasn\u2019t\nsecret, it was HKU4, which is common and which WIV has already published\npapers about.\n\n###\n\n1.6: DrJayChou\u2019s 7 Arguments\n\nOnce again, I cannot stress enough how much better a take you might have on\nthis debate if you watch it.\n\n  * \u201cThe first known case predates the market outbreak by a month\u201d - this is not the consensus position. I cannot say for sure what Dr. Chou means by this, but I suspect he\u2019s referring to one of the many claims to this effect that Peter effectively debunked during the debate (Connor Reed, Mr. Chen, the 92 cases, Brazil, etc).\n\n  * \u201cGenetic analyses put the realistic start date around Sept/Oct\u201d - see the section on Brazil above for the many reasons this is impossible. Pekar, the most-cited genetic analysis, puts the origin in November. Dr. Chou doesn\u2019t cite his sources, so I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s referring to, but it certainly hasn\u2019t entered the knowledge of the reality-based community.\n\n  * \u201cThe wet market cases were concentrated around a mahjong room\u201d. CTRL+F \u201cmahjong room in the original post\u201d. The mahjong room itself tested negative, and the \u201cepicenter\u201d mechanism isn\u2019t fine-grained enough to be useful (CTRL+F \u201cCentral Park\u201d in the original post for a discussion of why this is).\n\n  * \u201cNo animals at the market (or in Wuhan) tested positive.\u201d No raccoon-dogs were tested. In SARS1, which we know was zoonotic, they also never get positive animal tests at several wet markets where they knew spillovers had occurred. Again, imagine the alien, coming to Earth and taking a dozen randomly selected cats (not even humans this time!) and finding none of them had COVID.\n\n  * \u201cNo raccoon-dogs anywhere on the planet have tested positive, beyond those being forcibly infected to do experiments\u201d. False, this paper discusses an outbreak of COVID among raccoon-dogs on a farm in Poland.\n\n  * \u201cThey aren\u2019t capable of catching or spreading COVID\u201d. False, here\u2019s a paper on the subject which says that \u201cRaccoon dogs are susceptible to and efficiently transmit SARS-CoV2\u201d.\n\n  * \u201cThe clustering around the wet market in Wuhan . . . was just a product of oversmoothing\u201d. Here is a map of December 2020 COVID cases. I recommend ignoring the contour lines and just looking at the dots. How could dots be oversmoothed?:\n\n  * \u201cAt the time of the wet market outbreak, COVID was already spreading around the world\u201d. Dr. Chou doesn\u2019t give a source for this, but I think it\u2019s referring to the Brazilian data already discussed earlier.\n\nI think he had more of these somewhere else on the subreddit, but I\u2019m not\nfeeling like this is extremely worth my time.\n\n###\n\n1.7: How much should coverup worry us?\n\nGStew writes:\n\n> I personally agree it was not a lab leak but a pretty important was lost in\n> the debate (or at least poorly factored in). Namely China was hiding\n> evidence. While this may impact priors...the bigger impact is that, if it\n> was a lab leak we only know what information was released (which almost\n> certainly would be anything that boosted their preferred narrative) and do\n> not have all the evidence that was presumably withheld (which would be all\n> the evidence they could suppress that went against the preferred narrative).\n\nThis was discussed a bit, and Peter\u2019s position is that China was a bad actor,\nbut it wasn\u2019t specifically trying to suppress lab leak / favor zoonosis. As\noften as not, it was trying to suppress zoonosis, or just swat anyone who\nspoke up about anything.\n\nDuring SARS, the international health community criticized China for having\nwet markets where zoonotic spillovers could happen. China promised to clean\nthem up, then mostly didn\u2019t (for example, the raccoon-dog vendor at Wuhan was\nfined a few times, but kept operating). China\u2019s first priority was to prevent\npeople from accusing them of failing to clean up wet markets. For example,\nhere\u2019s what happened to Li Wenliang, the first person to raise the alarm about\na mysterious new epidemic centered around the wet market, (source):\n\n> On 3 January 2020, police from the Wuhan Public Security Bureau\n> investigating the case interrogated Li, issued a formal written warning and\n> censuring him for \"publishing untrue statements about seven confirmed SARS\n> cases at the Huanan Seafood Market.\" He was made to sign a letter of\n> admonition promising not to do it again. The police warned him that any\n> recalcitrant behavior would result in a prosecution.\n\nBecause of that, a lot of what we know about the possible zoonotic origins of\nthe epidemic is in spite of China, not because of them. For example:\n\n  * China killed all the animals at the market after the pandemic started, without telling anybody which ones they were. We know more about them because a Chinese researcher had been documenting them for an unrelated project about tick-borne diseases. He sent his work to Western journals, and after a mysterious delay they eventually published them.\n\n  * China denied that there were raccoon-dogs the market. In addition to the researcher\u2019s data, we know they were lying because we had virologist Eddie Holmes\u2019 travel photos of them.\n\n  * We have WIV\u2019s catalog of viruses because they tried to publish it in a Western journal just before the pandemic, the journal rejected it, and then years later they realized what they had.\n\nMy impression is that China (realistically Wuhan City Government, I don\u2019t\nthink Xi would have been involved at this early stage) made a vague attempt to\ncover up the wet market early on - but that it wasn\u2019t their Department Of\nCovering-Up\u2019s finest work. For example, when the WHO asked for files on early\ncases, China gave them what they wanted, and then Western scientists were able\nto plot their addresses and find that they centered on the wet market.\n\nIs it possible that China was trying to cover up a lab leak, and, in order to\nfool outsiders, pretended to be covering up the wet market, while actually\nfeeding international observers datasets massaged to make the wet market look\nmore likely? Anything is possible. But as a sign of the Chinese government\u2019s\nlevel of competence, remember that they didn\u2019t put a travel ban on Wuhan until\nJanuary 23, ie after many Wuhanites had left to visit family for the Lunar New\nYear holiday. So they would have to be executing their brilliant fake-cover-\nup-to-detract-from-the-real-coverup scheme while also being too stupid to\nprevent Wuhanites from taking the train to Beijing.\n\nTwo more short points:\n\nFirst, when the debate came to the question of China\u2019s cover-up competence,\nPeter presented this photo:\n\nThis is the Wuhan Institute of Virology\u2019s coronavirus research group, out for\na team dinner at a local restaurant on January 15th 2020 (ie a month after the\npandemic started). This isn\u2019t the most rational probabilistic evidence in the\nworld. But we\u2019ve already seen people take the rational probabilistic evidence\ntwenty different directions. So let\u2019s ask the same question Peter did - do\nthese look like people who secretly know they just started the worst pandemic\nin modern history?\n\nIf they secretly knew they\u2019d just started the worst pandemic in modern\nhistory, wouldn\u2019t they at least be wearing masks?\n\nI think China, WIV, etc, were as clueless as the rest of us, at least at the\nbeginning of the pandemic when a lot of this origins evidence was being\ncollected. They tried to shove the raccoon-dogs under the bed, to prevent\nanyone from accusing them of bungling their SARS commitments. But they weren\u2019t\nreally up to anything else.\n\nA more thorough argument would go over specific pieces of evidence, examine\nwhen they were collected (ie whether it was before or after China started\ncaring enough about COVID to get their competent people involved), and how\nChina could have rigged each.\n\nSecond, Peter (privately) discussed a Chinese conspiracy theory of his own\nwith me by email.\n\nHere\u2019s an article from a random Chinese blog (you\u2019ll have to Google Translate\nit). It describes China\u2019s preferred theory of COVID origins: it was started by\nimported lobster from Maine (really!) The lobster arrived in the wet market,\nthe wet market got sick, and diabolical Americans trying to hide their own\ncomplicity blamed it on raccoon-dogs and lab leaks and what-have-you.\n\nThe article includes this graphic:\n\nIt\u2019s a map of which vendors at the wet market got COVID and where their stalls\nare. In many ways, it matches the maps that China gave to Western scientists.\nIn other ways, it\u2019s better - it includes information that Western scientists\nonly inferred months after this article came out. But also, unlike the maps\nprovided to Western scientists, it says the raccoon-dog vendors got COVID -\nsomething China has previously denied, and which would significantly raise the\nodds of a natural origin.\n\nIs this China\u2019s internal record of what really happened at the wet market? Did\nthey fail some kind of critical communication about how classified it should\nbe, so that a guy in their propaganda department accidentally released it\npublicly in a stupid article about lobsters? That would be so embarrassingly\nweird that Peter didn\u2019t even try bringing it up in the debate. But in a\nresponse to a question about coverups, sure, let\u2019s get conspiratorial.\n\n###\n\n1.8: Have Worobey and Pekar been debunked?\n\nWorobey and Pekar are the two most prolific pro-zoonosis scientists, and many\nof the points in Peter\u2019s argument were based on them. Several people\ncriticized my writeup for not mentioning that these were \u201cdebunked\u201d, for\nexample:\n\nWorobey and Pekar have about a million papers, each of which makes many\ndifferent points, so I don\u2019t know for sure what these are referring to. But a\nfew other people make more specific claims, and I\u2019ll respond to them here:\n\n  * Pekar\u2019s paper on the two lineages originally estimated 99-1 odds of double spillover. Someone found a coding error that reduced it to 6-1 odds, Pekar admitted the error, and the paper has been updated. Other people have made other criticisms which I haven\u2019t investigated in depth and am agnostic on. I don\u2019t think my argument depends too much on the details of this paper. The argument for B earlier than A is that it infected twice as many people and has more genetic diversity. It\u2019s possible these things happened by chance and A preceded (and mutated to) B. In that case, I still think the most likely scenario is that A was released at the wet market, infected a customer or two, mutated to B, and infected a vendor. A then spread among the neighborhoods near the market, and B spread among market vendors.\n\n  * Worobey\u2019s paper includes an erratum saying he messed up the names of some of the supplementary data files. One of the data files also had the wrong number of samples somehow, but giving it the right number of samples didn\u2019t affect results in any way. Lots of lab leak proponents have been tweeting that \u201cWorobey finally admitted his paper was wrong!\u201d, but I think they just mean this erratum.\n\n  * Several people accused Pekar of ignoring intermediate lineages. Peter addressed this by finding these were mostly sequencing errors. There\u2019s a very new paper about potential intermediate lineages which might change this debate; my provisional assessment is that it\u2019s boring but I\u2019m waiting to see if other people have more thoughts on it.\n\n  * Several people linked to Biorealism\u2019s 16 arguments as examples of Pekar/Worobey being \u201cdebunked\u201d. I tried to address these above.\n\n  * Several people claimed there was ascertainment bias in their papers. I try to address this below.\n\n  * If there are other claims about Pekar and Worobey being \u201cdebunked\u201d, I don\u2019t know them.\n\nIn general, I find claims about \u201cdebunking\u201d annoying even when they\u2019re made by\nImportant People who theoretically have the authority to make pronouncements.\nI think they\u2019re even more annoying when they\u2019re made by self-styled rebels who\nadmittedly disagree with the scientific consensus.\n\n###\n\n1.9: Was there ascertainment bias in early cases?\n\nobserveralt writes:\n\n> The judges put huge weight on early cases being near the market. Michael\n> Weissman's recent paper showing ascertainment bias in early case data is\n> also significant as Miller relies on the sampling being random. Chinese CDC\n> head at the time George Gao acknowledged this to the BBC last too. They\n> focused too much on and around the market and missed cases on the other side\n> of the city.\n\nHere\u2019s the Worobey map everyone is debating:\n\nBefore going further, I recommend reading page 8 of the supplementary text of\nWorobey\u2019s paper, titled \u201cRobustness Of Statistical Test Results To\nAscertainment Bias\u201d, or pages 14-17, \u201cAdditional Data Related To Case\nAscertainment Biases\u201d, which explain all the reasons he thinks this isn\u2019t\ntrue. I promise you aren\u2019t the first person to think that maybe Worobey could\nbe contaminated by ascertainment bias.\n\nIf that still doesn\u2019t help, Worobey talks more about his strategy for avoiding\nascertainment bias here. Most important, he counted only cases from December;\nthe market connection was discovered December 30 and added to diagnostic\ncriteria January 3. This doesn\u2019t mean bias is impossible - some of these\npoints are people who caught COVID on December 31, but only got diagnosed\nJanuary 4 after the new diagnostic criteria were added. But most cases are\npre-criteria. And Worobey looked at various subsets of pre-criteria cases and\nfound they were all at least as market-focused as the overall set. For\nexample, he looked at the earliest COVID records in one Wuhan hospital system:\n\n> 10 of these hospitals\u2019 19 earliest COVID-19 cases were linked to Huanan\n> Market (\u223c53%), comparable both to Jinyintan\u2019s 66% (of 41 cases) (4) and to\n> the WHO-China report\u2019s 33% of 168 retrospectively identified cases within\n> Wuhan across December 2019 (1). Regarding cases at the Wuhan Central\n> Hospital and HPHICWM, patients with a history of exposure at Huanan Market\n> could not have been \u201ccherry picked\u201d before anyone had identified the market\n> as an epidemiologic risk factor. Hence, there was a genuine preponderance of\n> early COVID-19 cases associated with Huanan Market.\n\nLikewise, a study conducted January 2 (so not impacted at all by the January 3\ncriteria) found that 27 of 41 known patients had market links.\n\nLikewise, the first five cases were all detected in the market, and it doesn\u2019t\neven make sense to talk about ascertainment bias for these.\n\nWhat is the Weissman paper that observeralt is talking about? It argues: if\nthe pandemic started at the market, each seemingly non-market-linked case must\nultimately derive from a market-linked case. Therefore, we should expect non-\nmarket-linked cases to require more steps than market-linked cases. Therefore,\nthey should be further away. But if we look at the map above, we see that not-\nmarket-linked cases are closer to the market than market-linked cases. So\nsomething must be wrong, and that something might be ascertainment bias.\n\n(at least this is my interpretation of Weissman\u2019s argument, which is more\nmathematical; read the paper to make sure I\u2019m getting it right).\n\nThis is a weirdly spherical-cow view of an epidemic, worthy of a physicist.\nIt\u2019s easy to think of reasons the linked-cases-should-be-closer rule might not\nhold. For example, suppose that on their lunch break, market vendors go have\nlunch at restaurants surrounding the market. They infect people in these\nrestaurants, who then infect their friends and family. But these people never\nwent to the market themselves. Now there are a bunch of non-market-linked\ncases immediately surrounding the wet market.\n\nBut also - of all markets in Wuhan, Huanan sold the most weird wildlife.\nSuppose someone in the boonies gets a craving for raccoon-dog one day, their\nlocal convenience store doesn\u2019t have it, so they hop on a bus and go downtown\nto the city\u2019s main wet market. Then they get infected with COVID. Now there\u2019s\na wet-market-linked case in the boonies.\n\nIn other words, we should expect two modes of spread: general geographic\ndiffusion from the epicenter, and people from far away who made specific\ntrips.\n\nIf this still doesn\u2019t seem obvious to you, consider - usually when COVID first\narrived in America or Brazil or wherever, they were able to trace it back to a\nspecific person from Wuhan who visited the country. If I was the first person\nin America to get COVID, I could usually say \u201cOh, it must have been my\nbusiness meeting with Mr. Chin from Wuhan\u201d. At the same time, if someone from\nthe next town over from Wuhan got COVID, they probably couldn\u2019t trace it back\nto a specific Wuhanite - everyone from Wuhan is coming and going so often that\nmy town is just full of COVID in general.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think Weissman\u2019s paper proves anything, and I think the general\npattern of blue and orange dots suggests ascertainment bias wasn\u2019t playing a\nrole.\n\nSo why does George Gao say that there was ascertainment bias? I looked for the\ndirect source of the Gao quote and couldn\u2019t find it; if someone else is able\nto, please let me know, since I\u2019d be interested in exactly what he thinks\nabout this.\n\n###\n\n1.10: Connor Reed / Gwern on cats\n\nGwern wrote:\n\n> Yes, I don't understand this (paraphrased) claim by Peter:\n>\n> > He also told the Mail that his cat got the coronavirus too, which is\n> impossible.\n>\n> 'Impossible', thus implying the man was lying?

Peter argued his\nstory didn\u2019t hold up, and one of his points centered around his claim that his\ncat might have caught COVID from him and died.\n\nUnfortunately, I mis-quoted Peter. I said Peter argued it was impossible for\nhis cat to get COVID-19 (false). His actual statement was that it\u2019s extremely\nrare for a cat to die of COVID-19.\n\nPeter, Gwern, and I then proceeded to get very confused about the exact claims\nand timeline, which I think is because Connor said totally different things in\ndifferent interviews:\n\n  * In an interview with Wales Online on 2/4/2020, he said that \"my kitten caught the feline coronavirus and developed pneumonia and died, but I don't think I caught it from her. I think that was just coincidence.\u201d\n\n  * In an interview with the Daily Mail on 3/4/20, he said that his kitten died, after a two-day illness, on the ninth day of him (Connor) having COVID. He said \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it had what I\u2019ve got, or whether cats can even get human flu\u201d (speaking as if it was him in the past, who thought he had flu because he hadn\u2019t heard of COVID yet).\n\nThis is a weird inconsistency! In the Wales interview, the cat got it before\nhim (at least that\u2019s how I interpret \u201cI don\u2019t think I caught it from her\u201d). In\nthe Mail interview, he got it nine days before the cat.\n\nIn The Wales interview, it\u2019s \u201cthe feline coronavirus\u201d. In the Mail interview,\nhe doesn\u2019t know what the cat got and speculates that it might have been COVID.\nBut also, if it was \u201cthe feline coronavirus\u201d, how would he know? Wouldn\u2019t you\nneed a vet to diagnose that? But in the Mail interview, he said he didn\u2019t\nleave the house for a week around the time his cat was sick. So how did he go\nto the vet?\n\nIt gets worse. In the Mail interview, he gave a day-by-day account of his\nsickness. On Day 12, he goes to Zhongnan University Hospital. He says:\n\n> As soon as I get there, a doctor diagnoses pneumonia. So that\u2019s why my lungs\n> are making that noise. I am sent for a battery of tests lasting six hours.\n\nAnd then says that he went home either that day, or the next.\n\n> Day 13: I arrived back at my apartment late yesterday evening. The doctor\n> prescribed antibiotics for the pneumonia but I\u2019m reluctant to take them\n\nBut in an interview with FOX News said:\n\n> He said he went to the hospital after he struggled to breathe and\n> experienced a bad cough, both of which are signs of the pneumonia-like\n> illness.\n>\n> \"I was stunned when the doctors told me I was suffering from the virus. I\n> thought I was going to die but I managed to beat it,\u201d he told the outlet,\n> adding he was hospitalized at Zhongnan University Hospital for two weeks\n> following his diagnosis.\n\nIn his earlier story, he was at the hospital for less than a day. Now it\u2019s two\nweeks.\n\nBut also, the doctors \u201ctold [him he] was suffering from the virus\u201d, but this\nis impossible - the virus hadn\u2019t been discovered yet. The whole point of Saar\nbringing him up is that he\u2019s a supposed anomalous case before the official\npandemic. So how did the doctors tell him this?\n\nIn the Mail interview, he tells a different story of how he learned he\u2019d had\nCOVID:\n\n> Day 52: A notification from the hospital informs me that I was infected with\n> the Wuhan coronavirus. I suppose I should be pleased that I can\u2019t catch it\n> again \u2014 I\u2019m immune now.\n\nDay 52 would be January 11th. So I think he\u2019s saying that, a month after he\nrecovered, the hospital \u201cinforms\u201d him it was coronavirus. Charitably, maybe\nthey kept his samples (really?), then re-tested them after COVID was\ndiscovered, found he had it, and told him. But, at a time when the eyes of the\nworld medical establishment were fixated on Wuhan and its new pandemic, didn\u2019t\nthey think to tell anybody that they\u2019d confirmed a case two weeks before any\nother known cases? Just called Connor and said \u201cHey, you\u2019re the first ever\nCOVID patient, congrats\u201d and did absolutely nothing else? And then he didn\u2019t\nshow up in any of those WHO searches for early cases?\n\nThere\u2019s one more weird inconsistency. Connor said in his interview that he\nthinks he might have gotten COVID at \u201cthe fish market\u201d:\n\n> Maybe I caught the coronavirus at the fish market. It\u2019s a great place to get\n> food on a budget, a part of the real Wuhan that ordinary Chinese people use\n> every day, and I regularly do my shopping there. Since the outbreak became\n> international news, I\u2019ve seen hysterical reports (especially in the U.S.\n> media) that exotic meats such as bat and even koala are on sale at the fish\n> market. I\u2019ve never seen that.\n\nThis sounds to me like a reference to the Huanan Seafood Central Market, ie\nthe wet market with the raccoon-dogs where the first confirmed cases were\nfound. He says \u201cthe fish market\u201d like he expects us to know which one he\nmeans, and adds that \u201csince the outbreak became international news\u201d, he\u2019d seen\n\u201chysterical reports\u201d in US media about it. US media was covering the Huanan\nMarket because that\u2019s where the pandemic was first found; it didn\u2019t cover any\nother fish market in Wuhan.\n\nDuring the debate, Saar objected that Connor lived on the opposite side of\nWuhan from the wet market; it would have taken him about an hour to get there.\nIt would be weird to \u201cregularly\u201d do your shopping somewhere an hour away. Saar\nspeculated that Connor meant somewhere closer to his home.\n\nI can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s weird to do your regular shopping at a market an hour\naway, but it really sounds like he\u2019s referring to the wet market where all the\ncases started here.\n\nBut also, isn\u2019t it weird that the first ever coronavirus case is a white\nperson? And that he\u2019s 25 years old, yet was hospitalized with COVID (about 1%\nof people in their 20s with COVID require hospitalization)?\n\nI think the best explanation for all of this is that Connor was making this\nall up. He told whatever story sounded cool at the time, and all of his\nstories ended up contradicting each other or making no sense. This would also\nexplain why he said he had COVID at a time when, by the standard narrative, it\neither didn\u2019t exist yet or was confined to a single-digit number of people.\n\n###\n\n1.11: Rootclaim Response\n\nSaar and Rootclaim wrote a response to my earlier post.

Saar writes:\n\n> A common objection to this method is that these outbreaks are caused by\n> cold-chain products brought into these markets.

For example, here\u2019s Dai et al on the\nXinfadi outbreak, the most important event of this type:\n\n> According to a joint publication by the Beijing CDC and 13 research\n> institutions, the outbreak at Xinfadi Market was likely to be initiated by\n> fomite transmission from contaminated foods imported via cold-chain\n> logistics (Pang et al., 2020; Beijing Daily, 2020b). Based on the\n> epidemiological investigations at the Xinfadi Market, the researchers\n> preliminarily concluded that booth #S14 in the aquaculture product selling\n> area on the basement floor of the primary trading hall was the source of the\n> initial transmission. Specifically, five customers were tested positive for\n> IgG/IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serological screenings, all of whom\n> visited booth #S14 on May 30 and 31, 2020. On May 30, 2020, the owner of\n> booth #S14 procured imported and fully packaged salmon from a company's cold\n> storage warehouse, then cut and processed the salmon for sale at the Xinfadi\n> Market. Laboratory tests showed that sample swabs from five salmon fish from\n> this supplier were tested positive by examining all salmon in the original\n> sealed packages (n = 3582) in the cold storage facility. Viral genome\n> sequencing showed that the viral strain isolated from one of the positive\n> salmon swabs was homologous to that isolated from the infected persons and\n> environmental samples at the Xinfadi Market (Beijing Daily, 2020b). The\n> joint study reported that an ancestral strain isolated from the Xinfadi\n> Market in Beijing was markedly different from the strains identified in two\n> preceding outbreaks in China and the sequences obtained in March 2020 in\n> Beijing. Phylogenetic analysis assigned the ancestral Xinfadi strain to\n> clade B.1.1. Given the fact that the ancestral sequences were mainly\n> identified in Europe, the strain was more likely to be imported to Beijing\n> rather than derived from strains previously circulating in China (Pang et\n> al., 2020).\n\nI know China has a bias towards believing frozen food COVID explanations, but\nthis all sounds pretty convincing to me.\n\nWhy is it more often markets than other places with cold chain products?\nPartly it\u2019s the migrant workers - a lot of seafood markets are right next to\nseaports, and the contact tracing eventually traces back to a fisherman who\ncame in through the seaport - I don\u2019t think this is any more mysterious than\nepidemics often starting via airport or any other transportation hub. But even\njust keeping the focus on cold chain products, - there have also been\noutbreaks in seafood distribution warehouses, on docks, and in a seafood\nprocessing work area. Markets have many more people than any of those\nlocations, and maybe (total speculation) cutting on cutting boards could\naerosolize bits of fish.\n\nThe strongest evidence that the Wuhan / Huanan Seafood Market epidemic wasn\u2019t\ncaused by migrant workers or imported seafood products is that there was no\nprevious COVID-infected source of workers or seafood. If there had been, we\nwould have noticed when the outbreak there spread (see Section 1.4 on Brazil).\n\nResponses to a few of Saar\u2019s other points below:\n\n> How many locations other than markets provide an interface with wildlife?\n> Were markets actually identified in advance to be high-risk spillover\n> locations or only in retrospect?\n\nI think scientists had called wet markets as an especially dangerous potential\ntransmission location in advance. See for example Infectious Diseases Emerging\nFrom Chinese Wet Markets, published in 2006, which says:\n\n\u00bb \u201cIn Chinese wet-markets, unique epicenters for transmission of potential\nviral pathogens, new genes may be acquired or existing genes modified through\nvarious mechanisms such as genetic reassortment, recombination and mutation.\nThe wet-markets, at closer proximity to humans, with high viral burden or\nstrains of higher transmission efficiency, facilitate transmission of the\nviruses to humans.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, a paper on an emerging bird flu expressed hope that it would not\nspread too widely, but concluded that:\n\n\u00bb \u201cEven in the event of yet another lucky escape, more measures must be taken\nto limit the amplification of viruses with pandemic potential in the wet\nmarkets around the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Reuters published an investigation: Chinese Markets May Be Breeding\nGround For Deadly Viruses, which said things like:\n\n\u00bb \u201cWe face similar threats from other viruses and such epidemics can happen\nbecause we continue to have very crowded markets in China,\" said Lo Wing-lok,\nan infectious disease expert in Hong Kong. \"Even though official measures are\nin place, they are not faithfully followed. We are not talking about just\ncivet cats, but all animals,\" he added.\u201d\n\nWet Markets, A Continuing Source Of SARS And Influenza, published 2004, is\nadmittedly focusing on the next SARS1 outbreak instead of on SARS2, but gets\nbonus points for mentioning both wet markets and labs as likely causes of the\nnext pandemic:\n\n\u00bb \u201cWill SARS reappear? This question confronts public-health officials\nworldwide, particularly infectious disease personnel in those regions of the\nworld most affected by the disease and the economic burden of SARS, including\nChina, Taiwan, and Canada. Will the virus re-emerge from wet markets or from\nlaboratories working with SARS CoV, or are asymptomatic infections ongoing in\nhuman beings? Similar questions can be asked about a pandemic of influenza\nthat is probably imminent. Knowledge of the ecology of influenza in wet\nmarkets can be used as an early-warning system to detect the reappearance of\nSARS or pandemic influenza.\u201d\n\nSaar mentions that there are several other possible sources like restaurants\nor farms. I think Peter demonstrated during the debate that pandemics are\nunlikely to start in rural areas, so farms aren\u2019t that important. Restaurants\nmostly source their products from wet markets. During SARS1, some pandemics\nstarted in restaurants because they kept the civets in cages next to the\ndiners (like how some Western restaurants keep lobsters). After SARS1,\nrestaurants stopped doing that and became a less likely spillover location.\n\nSaar again:\n\n> Scott quotes Peter, who implies that under the lab-leak hypothesis, we would\n> expect the confirmed early cases to be centered around the WIV. However,\n> cases are not expected to center on the lab. The lab is not spraying viruses\n> into the air or hosting thousands of locals daily. If a worker gets\n> infected, they spread the virus to their friends and family at completely\n> different locations.\n\nIn most places with an outbreak of known origin, epidemics show some\ngeographic clustering. This has been true ever since the very beginning of\nepidemiology, when John Snow successfully traced a cholera outbreak back to\nits origin at a contaminated water pump by taking the center of the map of\ncholera cases.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a 100% law of nature; an infected lab worker might get lucky and\nnot pass it to any of his lab co-workers. Still, we might expect him to infect\nhis family, the stores he went to, or the restaurants he went to.\n\nIf he lived near his workplace, these might also be near the lab. If he didn\u2019t\n- let\u2019s say he lived on the other side of town and had a long commute - he\nwould start a cluster near his house, or his favorite store, or his favorite\nrestaurant. Then the people there would infect their families/co-\nworkers/stores/restaurants. The cluster would start somewhere! Sure, some\npeople would infect nobody close to their work or home, and instead just\ninfect one person a hundred miles away who they breathed on during a trip -\nbut this is the exception, not the rule.\n\nSo you wouldn\u2019t expect a totally random distribution of cases all around\nWuhan. There would be one center, or maybe several centers.\n\nBut none of the claims that COVID was quietly spreading for months before the\nwet market have pointed to some alternate center of cases. If COVID was\nspreading for months before the lab, it somehow spread in a completely diffuse\ngeographical pattern, with people exactly as likely to infect people far away\nfrom them as close to them - until it reached the wet market in December, and\nthen spread in the normal center-radiating-outward way that every other\ninfection spreads.\n\n> All the evidence trying to support a spillover at the market is based on\n> complex models with many single points of failure, built from unreliable and\n> biased data. Therefore, it is difficult to give this evidence significant\n> weight as there is always a possibility of errors in the data or its\n> interpretation. More on this in the UFO comment below.\n\nDisagree. \u201cFirst known case was at a wet market\u201d is as simple as it comes.\nCertainly it\u2019s less complex than \u201cthe virus has a 12 nucleotide insertion at\nthe furin cleavage site, and even though those sometimes happen by natural\nrecombination probably this one didn\u2019t, and even though it looks out of frame\nmaybe there was some weird thing going on with serine that made it in frame\nthis one time only\u201d, which is Saar\u2019s star piece of evidence.\n\nI understand Saar thinks he can come up with lots of objections to \u201cseen near\nwet market is suspicious for wet market origin\u201d, then claim that getting over\nthose objections requires \u201ccomplexity\u201d. But if Peter had no dignity, he could\nalso come up with lots of objections to \u201cseen in same city as Wuhan Institute\nof Virology is suspicious\". He could say that maybe the civet farms of Hubei\nprovince were uniquely blah blah blah, and then Saar would have to prove that\nthe civet farms weren\u2019t uniquely blah blah blah, and then he could say \u201cOh,\nsure seems like you have a complex model with lots of unique points of\nfailure, it all depends on fifty facts about the regulation of civet farms.\u201d\n\n> To illustrate what a market looks like in a real zoonotic pandemic, consider\n> this study from SARS1. The researchers went to a random market and sampled\n> the wildlife sold there. 4 of 6 civets sampled were positive, and 3 of them\n> were phylogenetically distinct (i.e. infected in completely different\n> places).\n\nA scientist I talked to says the 3 phylogenetically distinct lineages were\nmost likely sampling errors. Still, this seems irrelevant to me since, again,\nno raccoon-dogs were tested.\n\n> Scott explains that Covid\u2019s closest known relative, BANAL-52, is rare and so\n> it\u2019s highly unlikely the WIV would\u2019ve had it available as the starting point\n> to engineer Covid . . . This is a basic mistake. SARS2 is not based on\n> BANAL-52 but a relative of it. There is nothing unlikely here.\n\nNo BANAL-52 relative close enough to create COVID from has ever been\ndiscovered.\n\nBy mentioning BANAL-52, I was trying to be maximally charitable to the lab\nleak side. In order to create COVID, they would need a virus very close to\nCOVID. But in years and years of searching, nobody has ever discovered a virus\nlike this. Therefore it must be rare. As a way of bounding how rare, let\u2019s see\nhow rare the closest virus ever discovered is. That\u2019s BANAL-52. It is very\nrare. Therefore, the COVID ancestor must be rarer than that.\n\nI don\u2019t know how strong this argument is, because maybe there are millions of\nrare viruses capable of becoming pandemics, such that getting any one of them\nis very easy, even though each one individually is rare. The version of this I\nfind convincing is that it should be a probabilistic cost to say that WIV did\ngain-of-function on a seemingly undiscovered and so-far-very-hard-to-discover\nrare virus instead of on any of the usual SARS-like viruses that people do\ntheir gain-of-function research on.\n\n> Overall, all attempts to portray [Connor Reed] as an unstable, delusional\n> person were unsuccessful.

When I looked for Chen information, I got this\nthread, where it\u2019s attributed to two Chinese hospital doctors, cross-checked\nwith the Chinese COVID data repository, and double-cross-checked with the\nsupplementary table in a peer-reviewed paper published by a team of Wuhan\ndoctors.\n\n> To understand how ridiculous the claim is that the HKU1 insertion looks just\n> as engineered as SARS2\u2019s, here are their alignments.

If you take the virus the day\nbefore, and then the other virus the day after, there will be no differences\nexcept the insert, and it will look just like COVID (ie an insert without many\nother mutations).\n\nThe fact that the COVID comparison has few mutations, and the HKU1 insert has\nmany mutations, just shows that whatever older virus we chose to compare HKU1\nto is more distant from HKU1 than BANAL-52 (or whatever) is from COVID.\n\nOr am I missing something here?\n\n> [The evidence that China tried to cover up zoonosis from the start] is\n> untrue.

February: Fine, it\u2019s out of control, but you would not\nbelieve how great our response was. We're basically heroes. March: COVID was a\nUS bioweapon, or possibly came from Italy. April: Chinese people are banned\nfrom researching the origins of COVID without government permission.\n\n#\n\n2: Comments Arguing Against Lab Leak\n\n###\n\n2.1: Is the pandemic starting near WIV reverse correlation?\n\nrandomstringofcharacters wrote:\n\n> Isn't [the pandemic starting near the lab] a reverse correlation issue? The\n> lab is situated there because it's an area where coronaviruses were found in\n> the past.\n\nMany people had this question, but Wuhan Institute of Virology was founded in\n1956, didn\u2019t originally focus on coronaviruses, and isn\u2019t in a coronavirus hot\nspot. Most of WIV\u2019s coronavirus samples come from Yunnan, about a thousand\nmiles away. COVID\u2019s closest relatives were found in Laos, almost two thousand\nmiles away.\n\nDuring the debate, both Saar and Peter calculated the odds of a natural\npandemic arising in Wuhan by dividing the population of Wuhan by the total\nurban population of East Asia (Saar) or South China (Peter). Saar got 1.5%,\nPeter got 3% (he later said this could be as high as 10% because it was a\ncentral hub in the wildlife trade).\n\nThis isn\u2019t an Official Position and I don\u2019t think anyone else shares it, but\nduring the debate Peter pointed out a few times that there are plenty of\ndisease-ridden bats in Hubei (the province Wuhan is in), and that it\u2019s not\nimpossible that a bat virus currently known only in Laos could be active in\nHubei. Still, this is the minority viewpoint and most scientists just think it\ninvolved something about the wildlife trade.\n\n#\n\n3: Other Points That Came Up\n\n###\n\n3.1: Apology to Peter re: extreme odds\n\nquiet_NaN wrote:\n\n> Hot take: Peter clearly failed to convince anyone.\n>\n> The lab leak odds, in log10 (i.e. orders of magnitude are):\n>\n> Peter -20.7 Saar 2.7 Eric -3.1 Will -2.5 Scott -1.2 Daniel -1.4\n>\n> One of these numbers is clearly an outlier.

At 2e-21 odds, we would\n> probably have to consider the possibility that the WIV built a time machine\n> and went back in time to infect the wet market.\n\nI might have screwed up here - or at least I should have emphasized the\n\u201ctrolling\u201d part. Peter complained about my presentation of his extreme-odds\nslide, saying:\n\nThis is basically accurate. During the debate, Saar gave lots of different\nnumbers. I don\u2019t want to say exactly what the different numbers meant, because\nin earlier drafts of my post, Saar said I misunderstood them. My impression\nwere that some of his numbers were conservative, others were central, others\nwere extreme, others were adjusted-for-out-of-model-error, others were not-\nadjusted, etc.\n\nIn an early draft of the post, I gave higher numbers for Saar. Saar asked me\nto replace them with the numbers I ended up using. I decided to agree, because\nI wanted to represent Saar fairly with the numbers he most centrally believed,\nbut also because these were closest to the numbers on his Rootclaim site so it\nwasn\u2019t like he was making them up just to fool me.\n\nPeter didn\u2019t argue quite as hard, and also he didn\u2019t have anything like the\nRootclaim site, so I just took his first set of numbers.\n\nTrying to piece things together, I think a reasonable summary would be:\n\n  * During the debate, Saar mentioned 700-million-to-one odds in favor of lab leak, not because he thought this was plausible, but just as a discussion of where the situation would end up if you didn\u2019t adjust for human fallibility.\n\n  * On his site, he properly adjusted for human fallibility.\n\n  * Peter, very reasonably responding to the numbers Saar gave during the debate and not the numbers he had elsewhere, trolled him by giving a set of numbers that came out to 10^25-to-one in favor of lab leak.\n\n  * I put the numbers everyone had actually given into my spreadsheet.\n\n  * Saar asked me to replace with his adjusted numbers, which he conveniently had in a canonical location. Peter had never bothered coming up with adjusted numbers (because he wasn\u2019t as interested in probabilistic analysis) and didn\u2019t ask me to change anything, so I didn\u2019t.\n\n  * The post made it look like Saar\u2019s numbers were reasonable and Peter\u2019s were crazy.\n\n  * In the part about why Saar thought the debate was unfair, I repeated his argument against Peter\u2019s crazy numbers. And because I thought it was an interesting and true rationality point, I went over it myself and endorsed it separately from \u201cit\u2019s a thing Saar said\u201d.\n\n  * This was unfair to Peter.\n\nOver the past few weeks, I exchanged ~100 emails with Peter and Saar, and made\ndozens of tiny changes like this in response to one side or the other thinking\nmy portrayal of them was unfair. Eventually I decided I would go crazy if I\nspent one more second talking to either of them and hit PUBLISH. This was\nunfair to them, and let a couple of smaller or harder-to-untangle\nmisrepresentations get through, which I regret. But not as much as I would\nhave regretted continuing the discussion.\n\n###\n\n3.2: Tobias Schneider on Rootclaim\u2019s Syria Analysis\n\nTobias Schneider wrote:\n\n> I have no horse in this particular race, but I do have a lot of expertise in\n> some of the areas rootclaims \"investigates\" (especially the stuff related to\n> Syria and chemical weapons) - where their analysis is so shoddy and\n> laughable it's indistinguishable from Youtube conspiracies - and the biggest\n> surprise to me here is that anybody really bothers with rootclaim in the\n> first place? The more you learn...\n\nTobias is talking about a Rootclaim analysis on who perpetrated a deadly\nchemical weapons attack in Syria (Rootclaim says it was rebels; Tobias\npresumably thinks it was the government).\n\nThis analysis is at the top of Rootclaim\u2019s Track Record page, which says:\n\n> Rootclaim\u2019s conclusion contradicted all Western intelligence agencies, but\n> years later was shown to be correct. This demonstrates that superior\n> inference methodologies are far more important than privileged access to\n> information.\n\nApparently Tobias disagrees that it \u201clater was shown to be correct\u201d. Of note,\na Tobias Scheider is listed as editor of Syria in Context, a set of \u201cweekly\nbriefs covering key humanitarian, stabilization, and security policy\ndevelopments in and around Syria\u201d. Wikipedia and all Western governments agree\nwith Tobias and not Saar.\n\nAfter Saar repeated that his analysis turned out to be \u201cspot on\u201d, Joshua E\nobjected:\n\n> If you are going to claim your analysis is spot on, please link to a\n> credible independent source. Otherwise this comes across as we believe this\n> unlikely thing and used our analysis you find shoddy to conclude we were\n> right so you should not consider our analysis shoddy.\n\nAnd Saar again:\n\n> Follow the link [to a discussion on Rootclaim]. It describes external\n> forensic work which you can verify yourself . . . [Media] outlets have no\n> incentive to publish such findings. Sadly these are the kinds of things you\n> need to verify yourself.\n\nThe Rootclaim analysis says:\n\n> The new findings are a result of what we believe to be the most impressive\n> independent open-source investigation in history. It was initiated nearly a\n> year ago by several volunteers who reviewed all the evidence from the attack\n> and managed to uncover incontrovertible evidence implicating an opposition\n> faction, confirming Rootclaim\u2019s conclusion.\n\nWhich links to this report, somehow affiliated with Rootclaim and written by\n\"Michael Kobs, Chris Kabusk, Adam larson, and many helpful citizen\ninvestigators.\" It looks like Saar and some other people who didn\u2019t believe\nthe standard theory worked together to do some video forensics, which they\npublished in a report. But governments, intelligence agencies, the media,\nWikipedia, etc, haven\u2019t noticed the report or updated on it.\n\nSo when Saar says that his method has a great track record, what he means is\nthat when he looks into it further, he becomes even more convinced of his\nprevious position. He doesn\u2019t mean that any kind of external consensus has\nshifted towards his results over time.\n\nDuring my email discussions with Saar, he kept insisting his position was\nobviously right. He would send me emails like (not exact quotes) \u2018Now that\nI\u2019ve demolished all the evidence for zoonotic transmission, you have to agree\nwith me, right?\u2019 or \u2018You must secretly agree I\u2019m right, it\u2019s just be hard for\nyou to admit.\u2019 I\u2019m sympathetic to this way of thinking - my beliefs also\nintuitively feel so obvious that nobody could possibly disagree. But I\neventually learned real life didn\u2019t work this way; I think Rootclaim would\nbenefit from a similar lesson.\n\n###\n\n3.3: Closing Thoughts On Rootclaim\n\nIn my post, I suggested that if Saar wants to convince people that Rootclaim\nworks, instead of sponsoring debates he should train more people to use it,\nthen test whether there\u2019s inter-rater reliability (eg five people, each doing\nan independent Rootclaim analysis, all get similar probabilities on COVID\norigins. Saar responded:\n\n> We don\u2019t think this would be convincing to a wide audience outside people\n> who think like Scott. However, we don\u2019t really have any better ideas, and\n> would love to hear ideas from readers.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should do this for me or people who think like me. I think\nyou should do it for yourself.\n\nHave you ever done a Rootclaim analysis on Rootclaim itself? Probability that\nRootclaim works significantly better than a smart person using their normal\nintuitive reasoning methods? Why not?\n\nMaybe this is wrong, but still. You\u2019ve got to be curious if it works, right?\nAnd short of an oracle, proving inter-rater reliability is the best you\u2019re\ngoing to get.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t want to convince yourself, this is the correct next step.\nAgain by analogy to Tetlock - if he had started with just one superforecaster,\nand his thesis was \u201cthis guy is really smart, but I refuse to prove it\u201d,\nnothing would have changed. Instead, his theory of change goes through\npublishing in a bunch of papers, to identifying other superforecasters, to\nteaching general principles of superforecasting, to superforecasting as a\nservice (either through specific superforecasters at GJO, or through projects\nthat seek to emulate them like Metaculus, FutureSearch, etc). If Rootclaim\ndoesn\u2019t scale, it either dies with Saar, or at best Saar lives a long life and\nputs out a few more dozen Rootclaim analyses but nothing else comes of it.\nYou\u2019ve got to start training other people eventually, and part of that process\ninvolves demonstrating you did it right, and that\u2019s going to involve inter-\nrater reliability.\n\n#\n\n4: Conclusions And Updates\n\nI don\u2019t like getting in fights, and boy was this a fight.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t like making sweeping generalizations about The Nature Of\nPseudoscience - it\u2019s too likely to be incredibly embarrassing if it later\nturns out I was one in the wrong.\n\nBut I do feel like there\u2019s a method going on here. It\u2019s nothing sinister, just\nthat the lab leak people have 100x more zealots and energy, and there are some\nstrategies that make sense in that position, which no single individual\nnecessarily chooses, but which are very noticeable from the other side.\n\nThe most glaring is the constant focus on \u201cas of one minute ago, the case for\nthe opposite side is in SHAMBLES\u201d. The \u201cas of one minute ago\u201d makes it hard to\ntrust institutional consensus or published papers - what if they just haven\u2019t\ncaught up to the new evidence? The \u201cin SHAMBLES\u201d is always a couple of papers\nthat have \u201cnow debunked\u201d the best papers of the other side. These come out on\na regular schedule. They\u2019re usually by people in unrelated fields - the ones I\nsaw on COVID origins were by computer scientists, physicists, and agricultural\nscientists. They\u2019re usually either preprints, or published in weird journals\nin unrelated fields. But they sure do look like Scientific Papers and have\nlots of equations in them, and they always end with \u201c...and therefore this one\nperipheral argument in So-And-So Et Al 2020 is wrong.\u201d\n\nOnce you collect, I don\u2019t know, ten of these, you can spam a bunch of opposing\ndiscourse with \u201cThis didn\u2019t even consider these ten new papers, all converging\nupon the fact that this case has now been debunked\u201d. The very prestigious\nresearchers who wrote the original paper probably won\u2019t respond, because they\ndon\u2019t have time to respond to pre-prints by agricultural scientists. So it\ndoes kind of look, to an outsider, like all of the top papers of the side with\nmore institutional support are debunked. Even if you spend hours and hours\ntalking to the scientists involved and trying to figure out the flaws, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter, because there will be a new set of papers like that a few\nweeks later.\n\nSome of this is inevitable - and it\u2019s also what correct people have to do when\narguing against incorrect papers. When people were still treating eg\nstereotype threat as state-of-the-art, I would respond to people talking about\nit by listing some of the papers that had debunked it, and probably that was\nannoying to supporters who didn\u2019t want to have to defend it. So I don\u2019t want\nto claim it\u2019s all inexcusable bad behavior. Still, it\u2019s something I\u2019m more\nsensitive to now.\n\nA lot of these problems center on a failure mode of hyperfocusing on little\ndetails. What if the exact set of cases Worobey et al uses is contaminated by\nascertainment bias? Then we have to throw it out, right? Compare Worobey\u2019s\nanalysis in the supplementary text, where he shows robustness to up to half of\nthe cases being totally false. Or consider his search for alternative\nuncontaminated datasets and then showing how those demonstrate the same\npattern. Or consider that the first five cases ever detected were all from the\nmarket, and even that\u2019s enough to prove at least a pared-down version of\nWorobey\u2019s thesis. It\u2019s fine to also want to make sure the official argument is\nexactly right and not biased. But just doing that seems like a failure of\nfocus.\n\nThis is also how I feel about \u201cThere was a Brazilian case in November!\u201d or\n\u201cThere was a weird case that might have been something in Italy in October!\u201d\nor whatever. Instead of focusing on the exact sentences in a paper with \u201cPEER-\nREVIEWED!\u201d on the header, think about the big picture. If there had been lots\nof COVID in Brazil in November 2019, why didn\u2019t it spread? Why wasn\u2019t Rio\nlocking down at the same time Wuhan was? Why didn\u2019t governments notice and\nstart banning flights from Brazil? If there were a bunch of cases floating\naround Wuhan in autumn 2019, why didn\u2019t any of them form noticeable case\nclusters, the same way COVID did everywhere else? Sure, the 30,000 negative\nblood tests already refute this, but you shouldn\u2019t need those!\n\n(and this is also how I feel about all the \u201cA/B intermediate found in\nMalaysia! A/B intermediate found in Shanghai!\u201d claims. Okay, so there were 1\nbillion cases of A, 2 billion cases of B, and . . . a single-digit number of\ncases of the intermediate, detected months later? Why? I\u2019m not saying this is\nunanswerable, I\u2019m saying that the fact that lab leak doesn\u2019t even wonder about\nthis or start making arguments for it is why I feel like they don\u2019t have a\nstory - just a stamp collection of anomalies that fade away under closer\nobservation).\n\nI know this comments post won\u2019t be the end of the story. I know that (just as\nwith every other one of my posts, I\u2019m not blaming origins debaters in\nparticular here) someone\u2019s going to go \u201cSure, Scott confronted 489 arguments.\nBut hw failed to confront the strongest argument against his case - this one\nobscure article in a Nepalese journal that nobody except me has ever heard of.\nThat means he\u2019s a bad-faith actor strawmanning everyone he disagrees with!\u201d I\nknow that someone will find some detail I\u2019m wrong about and spam it all over\nTwitter with \u201cScott didn\u2019t realize that an 91Q mutation is different from a\nZY6 mutation, how can you ever trust anything he says?\u201d And I know that next\nmonth, someone will come up with another SMOKING GUN! - and if I don\u2019t respond\nto it immediately they\u2019ll say I\u2019m scared and know I\u2019ve lost and am refusing to\nadmit I\u2019m wrong out of sheer stubbornness, and twist some quote of mine to\nshow I\u2019ve admitted I\u2019ve changed my mind.\n\n(The one argument I know about, haven\u2019t responded to, and it really is because\nI\u2019m lazy and scared and bad is Michael Weissman\u2019s Bayesian analysis here. It\u2019s\n25,000 words and uses a bunch of logits and calculus. Sorry, pass.)\n\nIf it helps, I\u2019m currently working out terms for a 6-digit lab leak bet of my\nown (no guarantee this will come to fruition, most of these fall apart in the\nresolution criteria stage). I feel bad for not being willing to answer every\npossible lab leak argument going forward, but hopefully offering lab leakers a\nfew hundred thousand dollars if I\u2019m wrong will be a suitable consolation\nprize.\n\nFor now, I\u2019m still at 90-10 zoonosis.\n\n### Subscribe to Astral Codex Ten\n\nBy Scott Alexander\n\nP(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.\n\n12 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n12\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Highlights From The Comments On The Lab Leak Debate\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n10\n\nShare\n\nShare this discussion\n\n#### Highlights From The Comments On The Lab Leak Debate\n\nwww.astralcodexten.com\n\n10 Comments\n\n  * New First\n  * Chronological\n\napxhardapxhard58 mins agoDoes anyone else feel like this whole thing is an\nargument that science should be done purely anonymously?It seems impossible to\nseparate ego and tribalism from these analyses.

A novel coronavirus emerges in the same\ncity as a lab doing experiments on novel coronaviruses and not anywhere near\nwhere such viruses naturally occur, or in any of the other cities of the world\nwhere animals and humans come into regular contact.2\\. PRC immediately blocked\nall investigations.3\\. Self-proclaimed \"prestigious scientists\" thought a lab\nleak was \"just so freaking likely\", lied about it deliberately and then\norganized a PRC-style conspiracy to shut down all such speculation.Sum that up\nand it looks very likely that it came from the lab and everyone with relevant\nexpertise immediately realized that was the most likely probability.For the\nspecific questions about things like Brazil or whatever that seem baffling,\nall those apparent problems are only problems if you continue to accept that\nmodern epidemiology has any accuracy or value. It doesn't, at all. These are\nthe people who claimed with 100% confidence that COVID wouldn't be seasonal,\nthat it spread in a homogenous population and it would grow without end until\neveryone had been infected unless there were hardcore lockdowns. No other\nrespiratory virus works that way, and sure enough COVID cases turned out to be\nseasonal, to depend heavily in things like age and superspreaders, and to peak\nlong before everyone was infected. Lockdowns meanwhile made no difference.So\nif there was an early release that went around the world before it was\nofficially recognized, we shouldn't be baffled by non-problems like \"why did\nit not double every 3 days in Brazil\" because that claim was wrong to begin\nwith. There is no prestige, there is no skill. Computer scientists are far\nbetter at building models and agricultural scientists (or indeed workers)\nunderstand animal disease dynamics far better than academic epidemiologists.\nThe people with prestige here are not the ones ignoring counter-\narguments.Expand full commentReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nDaniel17 mins agoThis is really great Scott.

However if it\u2019s\nproven to be 100% lab created I would go with an American attack.Why? Well as\nSherlock said if you eliminate the impossible then whatever remains, however\nimprobable, must be the truth. And the leak is highly unlikely given where the\nvirus clearly originated - the wet market.Lab created is not lab leak, yet\neverybody assumes this to be true. But these are independent variables.Also\nwere it an attack then choosing Wuhan has two layers of plausible deniability\n- the wet market (where in this scenario it\u2019s deliberately implanted). The\nsecond layer is if the virus is proven to be proven to be lab created then\npeople would still blame the Chinese.Obviously this wouldn\u2019t work with\nBeijing.Another fact that might put some credence into this conspiracy theory\nis the very strong efforts by western media and scientists to deny the lab\norigin. Were it proven to be lab grown this would be retrospectively\nsuspicious.Anyway this isn\u2019t my belief - I\u2019m team zoonotic.
