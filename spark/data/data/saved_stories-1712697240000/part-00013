Tradeoffs can\nbe made about the topology of a NoC, the resources consumed, and the latency\nassociated with traffic for a defined bandwidth. A NoC also can help keeping\ndata coherent between distributed computing elements.\n\n\u201cEvery design needs a NoC or can benefit from one \u2014 even the smaller designs,\u201d\nsays Frank Schirrmeister, vice president solutions and business development at\nArteris. \u201cFor very complex designs, you might see hierarchies of more than 10\nNoCs on a chip. There are several reasons for this. The first is the\nseparation of the coherent and the non-coherent domains. The second is that\nyou have mixed criticality for safety of a chip. Part of it is just divide-\nand-conquer. As more hierarchies are being connected, it\u2019s just natural for\npeople to do a separation of the designs, of the problem, by having the\ndifferent domains.\u201d\n\nFig. 1: Divide and conquer showing different blocks connected using coherent\nand non-coherent NoC IP. Source: Arteris\n\nCommunications networks continue to evolve. \u201cNoCs famously arrived on the\nscene in the early 1990s, with various proprietary implementations to solve\nthe problem of what do we do with multi-processor cores and their ability to\ncommunicate outside their own memory domain,\u201d says Gordon Allan, product\nmanager for verification IP at Siemens Digital Industries Software. \u201cPacket-\norganized network-on-chip topologies were developed at that time for\ndistributed processing. Now, 2.5D and 3D-IC are opening up new opportunities\nfor communication topologies. The innovation that has happened over the\ndecades can continue in a new way with 3D-IC because of the ability to have\nmany more cores in close proximity, in a very fast, very wide networking\narrangement.\u201d\n\nAs this progresses toward a world of 3D chip construction, the design\nhierarchies become deeper. \u201cLarge, complex, multi-core chiplets will require\nnew concepts for advanced communication between the cores, the memory, and the\nperipherals,\u201d says Andy Heinig, head of department for efficient electronics\nat Fraunhofer IIS\u2019 Engineering of Adaptive Systems Division. \u201cSuch\ncommunication structures must be hierarchical, with at least one hierarchy\nlevel on the chip and one hierarchy level on the system level that combine\nboth chips.\u201d\n\nSuccess means the NoC stays essentially invisible. \u201cNoCs must extend\nseamlessly across chips and across chiplets,\u201d says Raymond Nijssen, vice\npresident and chief technologist at Achronix. \u201cThis is essential to realizing\nthe system in a package paradigm, which is essential to making technology\nscale to keep Moore\u2019s Law alive. It\u2019s also important that no new protocols or\nuse models are required to use an inter-chiplet NoC from a design perspective.\nFor example, if an existing intra-chip NoC transports transactions between AXI\nports, then an inter-chiplet NoC should look the same.\u201d\n\nThere currently appear to be at least three ways in which the overall problem\nis being approached. \u201cThe first is single-vendor, meaning that a company\neffectively controls all pieces, including all chiplets,\u201d says Elad Alon, co-\nfounder and CEO of Blue Cheetah. \u201cThey will do whatever makes sense in the\ncontext of either a specific product or product family. The other extreme is\nthe plug-and-play chiplet market. This is where companies build chiplets that\nI can buy and integrate those together to make a unique design. It requires\nnot only that the functionality is partitioned how I want it, but that they\nare electrically and mechanically compatible, have all the protocol choices\nconsistent, and makes sense in the required use cases.\u201d\n\nFig. 2: Chiplet use cases. Source: Blue Cheetah\n\nIs that an impossible dream? \u201cIf you have true heterogeneous systems laid out\nside-by-side in a package, perhaps using an EMIB-style linkage or substrate\nlinkage, you can use standard interfaces such as UCIe on each package,\u201d says\nSiemens\u2019 Allan. \u201cYou can tunnel higher-level protocols, or layer them over the\ntop, such as Ethernet or CXL or PCIe. It doesn\u2019t matter that your dies have\ndifferent geometries, or different thicknesses, or different electrical\ncharacteristics. There will be attributes in the package associated with the\nspace to leave around the die. But generally speaking, that\u2019s the point of\nchiplets. You can integrate those heterogeneous, different-geometry dies\nwithout consequences.\u201d\n\nUntil we get there, there is a third approach that is gaining traction.\n\u201cMulti-vendor ecosystems are emerging,\u201d says Blue Cheetah\u2019s Alon. \u201cThe\ndistinction here is that there is cooperation between a group of companies.\nThey get together, do planning as larger monolithic organizations would be\ndoing. If company A is good at task X, and company B is good at task Y, then\nhere is how we\u2019re going to put these things together. The product was pre-\nconceived and is designed for a particular target market and target specs.\nPeople know what they need to build.\u201d\n\nA separation of concerns Hierarchical design relies on some fundamental tenets\nthat can provide significant advantages. \u201cThere are several ways in which this\ncan happen,\u201d says Arteris\u2019 Schirrmeister. \u201cThe development team can be\ndistributed, and you could have multiple disciplines not fully understanding\nwhat the other one does. For example, there may be a safety island specialist\nwho has responsibility for the hardware security module sub-system. They do\nnot need to know anything about the CPU clustering, which is 4\u00d74 CPUs\nconnected coherently.\u201d\n\nSecurity is a growing concern. \u201cThe advanced NoCs themselves must provide\nfeatures that support security,\u201d says Fraunhofer\u2019s Heinig. \u201cIn an open chiplet\nsystem, each node can cause safety problems, so concepts for advanced NoCs are\nnecessary to close such gaps.\u201d\n\nBut the NoC cannot get in the way. \u201cMost people architect these things such\nthat the NoC effectively looks transparent, other than the fact that there\u2019s\nextra latency,\u201d says Alon. \u201cBut from a functional perspective, you\u2019re not\nsupposed to be able to tell. Having said that, one doesn\u2019t want to do a blind\ncut somewhere. If you do that, you can cause yourself more bandwidth pain and\nsuffering across the data interface than would have been necessary if you\npartitioned things a little bit differently.\u201d\n\nWell-placed functional boundaries can have other benefits. \u201cHow do we, as\nhuman engineers, grasp the complexity of the overall design sufficiently to be\nable to verify it?\u201d asks Allan. \u201cWe keep saying this design is too big to\nunderstand. Well, no, it\u2019s not if we abstract it sufficiently into hierarchies\nand components that we can understand. We don\u2019t need to understand all of it\nall at once. We need to understand the detail in what we are verifying today,\nwhether it\u2019s a low-level block, a chiplet, an interface between two chiplets,\nor a network protocol carried over that interface. This separation of concerns\nis what gets us to move beyond Moore\u2019s Law and still understand what we\u2019re\nactually designing.\u201d\n\nTop-down or bottom-up? The semiconductor industry always has deployed a mix of\ntop-down planning coupled with bottom-up implementation and verification. This\nwas cemented in place with the development of the IP building block model, and\nit is expected to become even more pronounced when those blocks are hardened\ninto chiplets.\n\nHowever, some top-down questions need to be answered. \u201cHow do you design a\nsystem built from chiplets?\u201d asks Schirrmeister. \u201cStarting from the top, there\nare architectural questions, such as those involving latencies that can be\ntolerated across various interfaces and the bandwidth requirements. Are\ninterfaces bi-directional? How many channels do you need? In the past you had\nPCIe lanes, but now you have UCIe lanes. You need to put down a substrate\nacross chips, and you need to consider those architecture effects.\u201d\n\nBut that only has to go down the hierarchy so far. \u201cA company may be planning\nto use individual chiplets in a product family, or for some number of\ngenerations of products,\u201d says Alon. \u201cThey would have fairly detailed\nspecifications about the functionally provided by each of these partitions and\nthat does mean you have to make some choices apriori, such as details about\nthe protocols and what capabilities each chiplet has. Generally, people can\nprovision those things appropriately so long as you functionally understand\nwhat\u2019s happening on the two sides.\u201d\n\nProtocols become core architectural decisions. \u201cIf I have a processor that is\nrelying on cache coherency, potentially with another chiplet, it may speak\nCHI,\u201d says Schirrmeister. \u201cThere are people using CXL, which is a slightly\ndifferent form of coherency. That\u2019s what the NoC on the chiplets will speak.\nThen you need to figure out how the data is packed. There are interfaces for\nstreaming, such as AMBA CXS. UCIe has this thing called FDI, which is a Flit\ninterface, where these parallel bits are basically presented to the link\nlayer, and the PHY carries the data across. It has performance impacts,\nbecause you\u2019re packing the data. While these things alter latency, so does\nmoving to a different technology node.\u201d\n\nStandardization bodies are trying to rationalize it. \u201cThe ODSA OCP spec\ndefines two concepts,\u201d says Alon. \u201cOne is the interface profile, and the other\nis the bus variant. The interface profile defines that, \u2018This chiplet, with\nthis particular set of die-to-die interfaces, will carry the following sets of\nprotocols.\u2019 For example, an interface profile may say, \u2018I\u2019m carrying this\nnumber of AXI requests ports, and this number of responder ports. Here is how\nthey\u2019re packed.\u2019 It defines the set of protocols available for this NoC\nconnection point and how are they carried. The second concept is the bus\nvariants. When you say something uses CHI, that\u2019s not a unique definition.\nThere\u2019s a lot of optionality and optimizations that people will do in the\nspecific fields. The bus variance is a way of stating that this particular\ninterface is using this specific version of the protocols. From an overall\nperformance NoC perspective, that doesn\u2019t guarantee that everything will work\nat the performance level people want it to. But at least functionally, it says\nthese connections can be made in a consistent way, as long as everyone has\npublished what it is they are actually doing at that boundary.\u201d\n\nEvery layer in the communications protocol is seeing rapid progress. \u201cWe are\nseeing Ethernet evolving in the direction of synchronous, time-sensitive\nprotocols,\u201d says Allan. \u201cDepending on the processor functionality, we may see\nsome innovations in synchronous networks from chip to chip. Some people want\nto bring optical to the table. We\u2019ll see innovations in the transport, and\nUCIe is one of them. There will be innovations in the topologies and in the\napproach, whether it\u2019s packetization versus synchronous networking \u2014 possibly\neven analogous to the token ring networks of old, where there\u2019s bandwidth\ncreated, and you jump on that bandwidth if you need it. It\u2019s a decentralized\norganization rather than a switched top-down organization.\u201d\n\nBy bringing more functionality inside the package, there will be significant\nchanges in latency and bandwidth. In addition, shortening distances by going\nto 3D technologies will decrease communications times even compared to single\nchip solutions. \u201cIn all cases, there will be a latency impact for NoC\ntransactions going across chips, even in the 3D case, albeit to a lesser\nextent,\u201d says Achronix\u2019 Nijssen. \u201cThe bandwidth between chiplets will be much\nless, and there will be an increased power cost for going between chiplets.\nThis is not fundamentally different from multi-chip routing where there\u2019s no\nNoC. What\u2019s different is that a NoC multiplexes transactions over the same\nphysical connections and can trade off QoS (like latency) between different\nstreams. One challenge with this modeling is that most designs do not yet\nspecify latency constraints between communicating blocks.\u201d\n\nPut simply, not everyone needs the same solution. \u201cWhen you enter an open\nchiplet environment, as people would like it to be, you need standards,\u201d says\nSchirrmeister. \u201cYou have to make decisions, and this will eventually cluster\naround the types of ecosystems that will drive some of the subsets. Imec has\nan automotive chiplet initiative, and one of the discussions is what\ninterfaces you need in that ecosystem. That might not work for a data center\nguy. Consumer devices might be very different. It\u2019s essentially an extension\nof the challenges we were already facing for hierarchical NoCs on chip, but\nnow in the face of disaggregation for 2.5D and 3D environment, it\u2019s becoming\nmuch more complex.\u201d\n\nThat is expected to change over time. \u201cImagine in five years, we will be\nbeyond talking about an ecosystem of UCIe-compatible chiplets,\u201d says Allan.\n\u201cWe may be talking about compatibility at a higher layer, for example, some\nnetworking topology that a chiplet can offer, with easy plug-and-play\nparticipation in some network as SIP device. Standardization is what enables\nus to even imagine how to get our heads around that. It\u2019s a necessary step,\nand it enables us in EDA to provide standard-based verification IP.\u201d\n\nBut the path to get there may require smaller steps. \u201cFor the next several\nyears, at least, we don\u2019t actually have to solve the hardest, thorniest\ngeneral problems,\u201d says Alon. \u201cWe just need to get folks together to go after\nspecific targeted markets, and that\u2019s very much happening. It\u2019s not that these\nissues go away. But if you try and solve it specifically for a given target,\nas opposed to all possible things you might do, you can get traction much\nfaster.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading 3D-ICs May Be The Least-Cost Option Advanced packaging has\nevolved from expensive custom solutions to those ready for more widespread\nadoption. Commercial Chiplet Ecosystem May Be A Decade Away Technology and\nbusiness hurdles must be addressed before widespread adoption. An Entangled\nHeterarchy The informal structural hierarchy used in semiconductor design is\nimperfect but adequate for most tasks, yet other hierarchies are needed.\n\n307 Shares\n\n16\n\n41\n\n245\n\n2\n\nTags: 3D ICs Achronix Arteris Blue Cheetah chiplets CXL Fraunhofer IIS/EAS\nMentor network on chip NoCs ODSA PCIe Siemens EDA standards UCIe\n\n### Brian Bailey\n\n(all posts) Brian Bailey is Technology Editor/EDA for Semiconductor\nEngineering.\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n### Technical Papers\n\n  * Low-Overhead Fault-Tolerant Quantum Memory (IBM) April 7, 2024 by Technical Paper Link\n  * Scalable Verification of Memory Consistency (Purdue University) April 6, 2024 by Technical Paper Link\n  * Rowhammer Exploitation On AMD Platforms, DDR4 DDR5 (ETH Zurich) April 3, 2024 by Technical Paper Link\n  * Power Sub-Mesh Construction To Mitigate IR Drop And Minimize Routing Overhead (Intel) April 2, 2024 by Technical Paper Link\n  * Hybrid All-Optical Switching Devices Combining Silicon Nanocavities And 2D Semiconductor Material April 2, 2024 by Technical Paper Link\n\n## Knowledge Centers Entities, people and technologies explored\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### Money Pours Into New Fabs And Facilities\n\nInvestments boom as countries and companies vie for supply chain security and\ntechnology leadership.\n\nby Liz Allan\n\n### The Rising Price Of Power In Chips\n\nMore data requires faster processing, which leads to a whole bunch of problems\n\u2014 not all of which are obvious or even solvable.\n\nby Ed Sperling\n\n### Chiplet IP Standards Are Just The Beginning\n\nData and protocol interoperability standards are needed for EDA tools, and\nthere are more hurdles ahead.
