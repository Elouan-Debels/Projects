It\u2019s the (apparently) growing\ngap between the productivity of US workers and their pay. Here\u2019s what it looks\nlike:\n\nFigure 1: The Productivity-Pay Gap. Source: Economic Policy Institute.\n\nIn this post, I debunk the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 by showing that it has\nnothing to do with productivity. The reason is simple. Although economists\nclaim to measure \u2018productivity\u2019, their measure is actually income relabelled.\n\nAs a result, the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 isn\u2019t what it appears. It claims to be\na gap between productivity and wages. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s really a gap between\ntwo types of income \u2014 (1) the wages of workers and (2) the average hourly\nincome of all Americans. This gap is an important measure of inequality. But\nit has nothing to do with \u2018productivity\u2019.\n\n### How economists measure productivity\n\nTo understand the problem with the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019, we first need to\nunderstand how economists measure productivity. Economists define \u2018labor\nproductivity\u2019 as the economic output per unit of labor input:\n\nLabor Productivity=Labor InputOutput\n\nTo use this equation, we\u2019ll start with a simple example. Suppose we want to\nmeasure the productivity of two corn farmers, Alice and Bob. After working for\nan hour, Alice harvests 1 ton of corn. During the same time, Bob harvests 5\ntons of corn. Using the equation above, we find that Bob is 5 times more\nproductive than Alice: [1]\n\nAlice\u2019s productivity: 1 ton of corn per hour\n\nBob\u2019s productivity: 5 tons of corn per hour\n\nWhen there\u2019s only one commodity, measuring productivity is simple. But what if\nwe have multiple commodities? In this case, we can\u2019t just count commodities,\nbecause they have different \u2018natural units\u2019 (apples and oranges, as they say).\nInstead, we have to \u2018aggregate\u2019 our commodities using a common unit of\nmeasure.\n\nTo aggregate economic output, economists use prices as the common unit. They\ndefine \u2018output\u2019 as the sum of the quantity of each commodity multiplied by its\nprice:\n\nOutput=\u2211Unit Quantity\u00d7Unit Price\n\nSo if Alice sold 1 ton of corn at $100 per ton, her \u2018output\u2019 would be:\n\nAlice\u2019s output: 1 ton of corn \u00d7 $100 per ton = $100\n\nLikewise, if Bob sold 5 tons of potatoes at $50 per ton, his \u2018output\u2019 would\nbe:\n\nBob\u2019s output: 5 tons of potatoes \u00d7 $50 per ton = $250\n\nUsing prices to aggregate output seems innocent enough. But when we look\ndeeper, we find two big problems:\n\n  1. \u2018Productivity\u2019 becomes equivalent to average hourly income.\n  2. \u2018Productivity\u2019 becomes ambiguous because its units (prices) are unstable.\n\n### \u2018Productivity\u2019 is hourly income relabelled\n\nBy choosing prices to aggregate output, economists make \u2018productivity\u2019\nequivalent to average hourly income. Here\u2019s how it happens.\n\nEconomists measure \u2018output\u2019 as the sum of the quantity of each commodity\nmultiplied by its price. But this is precisely the formula for gross income\n(i.e. sales). To measure gross income, we multiply the quantity of each\ncommodity sold by its price:\n\nGross Income=\u2211Unit Quantity\u00d7Unit Price\n\nTo find \u2018productivity\u2019, we then divide \u2018output\u2019 (gross income) by the number\nof labor hours worked:\n\nProductivity=Labor HoursGross Income\n\nWhen we do so, we find that \u2018productivity\u2019 is equivalent to average hourly\nincome:\n\nProductivity = Average Hourly Income\n\nSo economists\u2019 measure of \u2018productivity\u2019 is really just income relabelled. The\nresult is that any relation between \u2018productivity\u2019 and wages is tautological \u2014\nit follows from the definition of productivity.\n\n### Ambiguous \u2018productivity\u2019\n\nIn addition to making \u2018productivity\u2019 equivalent to average hourly income,\nusing prices to measure \u2018output\u2019 also makes \u2018productivity\u2019 ambiguous. This\nseems odd at first. How can \u2018productivity\u2019 be ambiguous when income is always\nwell-defined?\n\nThe answer has to do with prices.\n\nWe expect prices to play an important role in shaping income. Suppose I\u2019m an\napple farmer who sells the same number of apples each year. If the price of\napples doubles, my income doubles. That\u2019s how prices work.\n\nIf \u2018output\u2019 is equivalent to income, it seems that my \u2018output\u2019 (of apples) has\nalso doubled. But here economists protest. Your apparent change in \u2018output\u2019,\nthey say, was caused by a change in price. To find the \u2018true\u2019 change in\noutput, you need to hold prices constant. When you do, you\u2019ll find that your\n\u2018output\u2019 remains the same.\n\nOn the face of it, this \u2018adjustment\u2019 for price change seems reasonable. But it\nactually leads to a measurement quagmire. To see this quagmire, we\u2019ll return\nto Alice and Bob.\n\nSuppose that Alice grows 1 ton of corn and 5 tons of potatoes. Bob grows 5\ntons of corn and 1 ton of potatoes. Whose output is greater? The answer is\nambiguous \u2014 it depends on prices.\n\nSuppose that corn sells for $100 per ton and potatoes sell for $20 per ton. We\nfind that Bob\u2019s output is about 250% greater than Alice\u2019s:\n\nAlice\u2019s Output: 1 ton corn \u00d7 $100 per ton + 5 tons potatoes \u00d7 $20 per ton =\n$200\n\nBob\u2019s Output: 5 tons corn \u00d7 $100 per ton + 1 ton potatoes \u00d7 $20 per ton = $520\n\nNow suppose that corn sells for $20 per ton and potatoes sell for $100 per\nton. We now find that Bob\u2019s output is about 60% less than Alice\u2019s:\n\nAlice\u2019s Output: 1 ton corn \u00d7 $20 per ton + 5 tons potatoes \u00d7 $100 per ton =\n$520\n\nBob\u2019s Output: 5 tons corn \u00d7 $20 per ton + 1 ton potatoes \u00d7 $100 per ton = $200\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here? When we aggregate output using prices, these prices\ndetermine the relative weighting given to corn and potatoes. When this\nweighting changes, the measurement of \u2018output\u2019 changes.\n\nAs a result, our measure of \u2018output\u2019 depends on the particular prices we\nchoose to hold constant. This is a big problem. It means that standard\nmeasures of productivity are inherently ambiguous. (For more details about\nthis ambiguity, see my work with Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler and with\nErald Kolasi.)\n\nTo summarize, using prices to aggregate \u2018output\u2019 leads to bizarre problems. On\nthe one hand, it causes \u2018productivity\u2019 to be equivalent to average hourly\nincome. This means that any connection between \u2018productivity\u2019 and wages is\ncircular. On the other hand, the same decision causes \u2018productivity\u2019 to be\nambiguous. Our measure of \u2018productivity\u2019 depends on arbitrary choices about\nhow to adjust for price change. As a result, productivity trends (like the one\nin Figure 1) are riddled with uncertainty.\n\n### Dissecting the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019\n\nNow that you understand the problems with how economists measure productivity,\nlet\u2019s return to the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019. I\u2019m going to dissect the evidence\nin Figure 1.\n\nThis chart comes from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI). By dissecting it, I\ndon\u2019t mean to pick on the EPI authors. They use methods that are standard in\neconomics. Instead, I want to show why these standard methods are flawed.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with how the EPI measures productivity. They write:\n\n> \u201cNet productivity\u201d [of workers] is the growth of output of goods and\n> services less depreciation per hour worked.\n\nTo non-economists, this sounds like the EPI is measuring some physical\nquantity of output. But they\u2019re not. Instead, the \u201coutput of goods and\nservices\u201d is economists\u2019 code for the value of goods and services, as measured\nby Gross Domestic Product (GDP). \u2018Depreciation\u2019 is code for the financial\ndepreciation of capital.\n\nWhen we subtract capital depreciation from GDP, we get something called \u2018Net\nDomestic Product\u2019:\n\nNet Domestic Product = GDP \u2013 Capital Depreciation\n\nSo the EPI defines \u2018economic output\u2019 in terms of Net Domestic Product.\n\nNow here\u2019s the rub. The national accounts are based on the principles of\ndouble-entry bookkeeping. This means that for every sale there is a\ncorresponding income. So when you build a house and sell it for $1 million,\nyou record the sale in one ledger as \u2018output\u2019. On the opposite ledger, you\nrecord the same sale as \u2018income\u2019. So \u2018output\u2019 is formally equivalent to\nincome.\n\nIn the national accounts, Net Domestic Product is the sales side of the\nledger, recorded as \u2018output\u2019. It\u2019s equivalent to the income side of the\nledger, which we call \u2018National Income\u2019 \u2014 the income of all individuals in the\ncountry:\n\nNet Domestic Product \u2248 National Income\n\nI\u2019ve put the \u2018\u2248\u2019 here to mean \u2018almost equivalent\u2019. There are some small\ndifferences between Net Domestic Product and National Income (some business\ntaxes, for instance). But in practice, the two quantities are nearly\nidentical, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: US Net Domestic Product And National Income. Data is from the Bureau\nof Economic Analysis Table 1.7.5.\n\nTo calculate workers \u2018productivity\u2019, the EPI divides Net Domestic Product by\nthe number of labor hours worked:\n\nProductivity=Labor HoursNet Domestic Product\n\nBut this is equivalent to dividing National Income by the number of labor\nhours worked:\n\nProductivity=Labor HoursNational Income\n\nWhen we divide National Income by total labor hours, we\u2019re actually measuring\naverage hourly income. So the EPI\u2019s measure of \u2018productivity\u2019 is identical to\naverage hourly income:\n\nProductivity = Average Income per Hour\n\nGiven this equivalence, any connection between \u2018productivity\u2019 and average\nhourly income isn\u2019t surprising. It\u2019s a tautology.\n\n### How can wages diverge from \u2018productivity\u2019?\n\nIf productivity is equivalent to average hourly income, how can wages diverge\nfrom \u2018productivity\u2019? In other words, how can the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 exist?\n\nLet me explain.\n\n\u2018Productivity\u2019 (as measured by the EPI) is equivalent to the average hourly\nincome of all US earners. Since average income can\u2019t diverge from itself,\naverage income and \u2018productivity\u2019 can\u2019t diverge. However, if we select a\nsubpopulation of US citizens, their income can diverge from the average. This\nis just a mathematical truism. If I select a non-random sample from a\npopulation, the properties of this sample need not match the properties of the\nwhole population.\n\nTo make this thinking concrete, suppose we select only CEOs. Must CEO income\ntrack with the national average? The answer is no. CEOs are a unique\nsubpopulation, so their income can diverge from the national average. And as\nyou probably know, CEO income has done just that. Over the last 40 years, the\nincome of US CEOs has grown drastically relative to average income.\n\n### Wages of production workers\n\nIn Figure 1, the EPI studies the wages of \u2018production/nonsupervisory workers\u2019.\nBecause these workers are a subpopulation of the US, their income can (and\ndoes) diverge from the national average. Over the last 40 years, the wages of\nproduction workers have declined relative to the average hourly income.\n\nThis decline, however, has nothing to do with productivity. Instead, it owes\nto a redistribution of income \u2014 a redistribution that has two parts. First,\nthe labor share of national income has declined over the last 40 years.\nSecond, over the same period, US wages and salaries have become increasingly\nunequal.\n\n### The declining labor share of income\n\nIn the national accounts, there are two basic types of income. If you earn\nincome from property, you earn \u2018capitalist income\u2019. If you earn income from\nwages and salaries, you earn \u2018labor income\u2019. The two types of income sum to\nNational Income:\n\nNational Income = Capitalist Income + Labor Income\n\nIf we select only \u2018laborers\u2019, it\u2019s possible for the average hourly income of\nthis subpopulation to diverge from the average income of the population. For\ninstance, if capitalist income grows relative to workers\u2019 income, it pulls up\nthe average income. This causes a gap between the wages of workers and the\nhourly income of the whole population.\n\nLooking back at Figure 1, we see that the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 emerges after\n1970. Not surprisingly, it\u2019s around this time that the labor share of US\nincome began to drop:\n\nFigure 3: Labor\u2019s Share of US National Income. Data is from the Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis Table 1.12. Labor\u2019s share is calculated as the \u2018compensation\nof employees\u2019 as a fraction of national income.\n\nThis decline of labor\u2019s share of income is partly why the EPI finds a\n\u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019. Remember that \u2018productivity\u2019 (as measured by the EPI)\nis equivalent to the average hourly income in the US. Since 1970, US workers\nhave received a declining share of this income. Consequently, their wages have\ndeclined relative to the average US income.\n\n### The growing inequality of labor income\n\nThe other reason that the EPI finds a \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 is because US\nwages and salaries have become increasingly unequal. Since 1970, the income\nshare of the top 1% of wage/salary earners has grown steadily:\n\nFigure 4: Top 1% of Wage/Salary Earners, Share of US Labor Income Data is from\nthe World Inequality Database (average of series flinc and plinc).\n\nIt may not be clear how wage inequality would affect the relative income of\nproduction workers. To help understand, we\u2019ll divide labor income into two\nparts:\n\nLabor Income = Production Workers Income + Non-Production Workers Income\n\nSuppose that the income of non-production workers increases relative to the\nincome of production workers. This increase pulls up the average labor income,\ncausing it to outpace the average income of production workers. Still, it\u2019s\nnot clear how this redistribution relates to wage inequality.\n\nThis is where hierarchy comes in.\n\nI propose that \u2018production workers\u2019 occupy the bottom two ranks in firm\nhierarchies. The bottom rank consists of \u2018shop floor\u2019 workers. The second rank\nconsists of \u2018working supervisors\u2019. Everyone in ranks three and above is a\n\u2018non-production worker\u2019 (i.e. manager).\n\nFigure 5: Production workers in a hierarchy. Production workers (blue) occupy\nthe bottom two ranks in a hierarchy. The first rank contains \u2018shop floor\u2019\nworkers. The second rank contains \u2018working supervisors\u2019. Ranks three and above\nare \u2018managers\u2019.\n\nIn this simple model, \u2018production workers\u2019 make up about 77% of total\nemployment. That\u2019s not far from the actual US figure of 82%.\n\nFigure 6: Production workers\u2019 share of US private employment. Data is from the\nBureau of Labor Statistics, series CES0500000001 and CES0500000006.\n\nWhat does our hierarchy model tell us about the income of production workers?\nIn hierarchies income increases steeply with hierarchical rank. (I review the\nevidence here and here.) So if production workers occupy the bottom of the\ncorporate hierarchy, they should also occupy the bottom of the income\ndistribution.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that production workers occupy the bottom 80% of US labor\nincomes. If labor income inequality increases, we expect the relative income\nof production workers to decline.\n\nFigure 7 shows a simple model of what this might look like. Here I\u2019ve defined\n\u2018production workers\u2019 as everyone in the bottom 80% of a hypothetical\ndistribution of income. I then calculate the average income of these\nproduction workers and compare it to the average income in the whole\npopulation.\n\nFigure 7: A model of the relative income of production workers. Here I model\n\u2018production workers\u2019 as the bottom 80% of earners in the population. As\ninequality (measured by the top 1% share of income) grows, the average income\nof production workers declines relative to the average income of the\npopulation. For the math people, I\u2019ve modeled the distribution of income with\na lognormal distribution.\n\nBecause production workers are at the bottom of the income distribution, we\nexpect their income to be below the population average. (That\u2019s why the y-axis\nvalues in Figure 7 are below 100%.) But just how far below depends on income\ninequality.\n\nAs we increase inequality in the population (shown on the horizontal axis in\nFigure 7) the relative income of production workers declines. When inequality\nis minimal, production workers\u2019 relative income approaches the population\naverage. When inequality is extreme, production workers\u2019 relative income\napproaches zero.\n\nIn Figure 7, the vertical red lines show the US top 1% share of labor income\nin 1970 and 2012. Given this growing inequality, our model predicts that the\nrelative income of production workers should drop by about 50%. This is on par\nwith the pay gap shown in Figure 1.\n\nIn short, the growing inequality of labor income can explain a large part of\nthe apparent \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019. Again, this gap isn\u2019t about productivity.\nIt\u2019s about the declining relative income of production workers.\n\n### The price-index problem\n\nWhile most of the apparent \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 has been caused by income\nredistribution, part of this gap is caused by price index shenanigans. In\nFigure 1, the EPI uses two different price indexes to \u2018adjust\u2019 for inflation.\n\nTo understand the problems with the EPI\u2019s method, we need to backtrack a bit.\nI\u2019ve already noted that \u2018productivity\u2019 is equivalent to average hourly income.\nBut this wasn\u2019t quite correct. \u2018Productivity\u2019 is equivalent to real average\nhourly income:\n\nProductivity = \u2018Real\u2019 Average Hourly Income\n\nUnlike \u2018nominal\u2019 income, \u2018real\u2019 income adjusts for inflation. To get \u2018real\u2019\nincome, we divide \u2018nominal\u2019 income by a price index \u2014 a measure of average\nprice change:\n\nReal Income=Price IndexNominal Income\n\nThere are many different types of price indexes. Some track a few commodities.\nOthers track many commodities. Because price change varies wildly between\ncommodities, different price indexes can vary wildly.\n\nHere\u2019s where the EPI errors. It uses the (implicit) Net Domestic Product\ndeflator to measure \u2018productivity\u2019 (i.e. real average income per hour). But it\nuses the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to measure the \u2018real\u2019 wage of production\nworkers.\n\nThis is a problem. The two price indexes have diverged since 1970 \u2014 the very\nperiod where the EPI finds a growing \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019. Here\u2019s what the\ndivergence looks like:\n\nFigure 8: The US Net Domestic Product deflator relative to the Consumer Price\nIndex. CPI data is from Federal Reserve Economic Data, series CPIAUCSL. The\nimplicit NDP deflator data is from BEA Table 1.17.6 (the ratio of nominal NDP\nto real NDP).\n\nTo put this in perspective, the EPI\u2019s method is like using different price\nindexes to compare the \u2018real\u2019 income of two people. Suppose Alice and Bob both\nstart out with $100. Over 40 years, both of their incomes grow to $200. We\nthen use the NDP deflator to find Alice\u2019s real income. But we use the CPI to\nfind Bob\u2019s real income. Although their nominal incomes are identical, we find\nthat Alice\u2019s real income outpaced Bob\u2019s by 20%.\n\nThe crime here is that we don\u2019t need price indexes to compare incomes. We can\ncompare Alice and Bob\u2019s incomes directly. Similarly, the EPI could have\ncompared the nominal income of production workers directly to the nominal\nhourly income in the US.\n\n### The declining relative income of workers\n\nThe problem with the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 is that it proclaims to be\nsomething it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not a gap between workers\u2019 productivity and their\nincome. Instead, it shows the declining relative income of workers.\n\nThe best way to look at this decline is to measure the relative income of\nproduction workers:\n\nRelative Income of Production Workers=Average Hourly Income of\nPopulationAverage Wage of Production Workers\n\nFigure 9 shows this relative income over the last 50 years. In 1964, US\nproduction workers earned 60% of the average hourly US income. By 2015, this\ndeclined to 35%.\n\nFigure 9: The relative income of US production workers. Average hourly\nearnings of production workers is from FRED series AHETPI. Average hourly US\nincome is calculated by dividing National Income (BEA Table 1.7.5) by the\nnumber of labor hours worked by US persons engaged in production (FRED series\nEMPENGUSA148NRUG \u00d7 series AVHWPEUSA065NRUG).\n\nWhat\u2019s important here is that we haven\u2019t dressed up income as \u2018productivity\u2019.\nWe\u2019re explicitly comparing two types of income \u2014 the income of production\nworkers relative to the national average.\n\nThe relative income of production workers has nothing to do with\n\u2018productivity\u2019. It\u2019s actually a measure of income inequality. As shown in\nFigure 10, production workers\u2019 relative income correlates strongly with the\nincome share of the top 1%. As income inequality increases, the relative\nincome of production workers decreases.\n\nFigure 10: The relative wages of production workers decline as US inequality\nincreases. For the sources for relative wages, see Figure 8. Data for the top\n1% share of income comes from the World Inequality Database.\n\n### Is \u2018productivity\u2019 still increasing?\n\nThe tale told by the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 (Figure 1) is that workers\u2019\nproductivity has increased steadily but wages have not. This is a powerful\npiece of propaganda. It says to workers \u201clook, the tide has risen, but it\ndidn\u2019t lift your boat\u201d.\n\nThe problem, though, is that it\u2019s not clear that the tide has actually risen.\nWe can say for certain that workers relative wages have declined (Figure 9).\nBut what about their productivity? Has it gone up as Figure 1 suggests?\n\nTo believe the \u2018productivity\u2019 trends in Figure 1, you have to put on a brave\nface. You have to believe that the myriad of subjective decisions made by\nstatistical agencies (reviewed here) are the \u2018correct\u2019 decisions. You have to\nbelieve that prices \u2018reveal\u2019 utility, and that monetary income is the same as\neconomic \u2018output\u2019.\n\nI, for one, don\u2019t believe these things. Consequently, I treat official\nmeasures of \u2018productivity\u2019 as garbage.\n\nHow should we measure productivity? It depends on what we think the economy\n\u2018does\u2019. Personally, I like the view taken by atmospheric scientist Tim\nGarrett. He treats the economy as a heat engine. Garrett uses the analogy of a\ngrowing child. It takes energy to maintain the child\u2019s body. And if the child\nis to grow, it needs to consume increasing amounts of energy. The same is true\nof the economy.\n\nWhen you think this way, you realize that \u2018useful work\u2019 (the amount of energy\nput to an end use) is a good indicator of economic output. I propose that we\ntreat useful work per labor as an alternative measure of labor productivity.\n\nHow does this alternative measure compare with the standard measure of\nproductivity? Figure 11 shows a comparison. Here I use real GDP per labor hour\nas the standard measure of productivity. I contrast this with Benjamin Warr\nand Robert Ayres\u2019 estimate for useful work per labor hour.\n\nFigure 11: How a physical measure of US productivity compares to the official\nmeasure of productivity. Data is from Benjamin Warr\u2019s REXS Database.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to spot the difference between the two series. The standard\nmeasure of productivity tells a tale of steady growth. In contrast, our\nphysical measure suggests that productivity has stagnated since 1970.\nInterestingly, this is the period when the relative wages of production\nworkers began to decline (i.e. when the apparent \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019\nappears).\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting question. Is the stagnation in useful work output\nrelated to the decline of workers\u2019 wages? Biophysical economist Carey King\nthinks so. He recently built a model to investigate this connection.\n\nThe important point is that it\u2019s far from clear that US productivity has\nincreased steadily over the 20th century. In energetic terms, productivity has\nstagnated since 1970. I, for one, think that this physical measure of\nproductivity is far more meaningful than the official measure. \u2018Useful work\u2019\nis based on the laws of thermodynamics. The standard measure of productivity,\nin contrast, is based on the dubious assumptions of neoclassical economics.\n\n### The productivity problem\n\n\u2018Productivity\u2019 is used by both major schools of economic thought. Neoclassical\neconomists use productivity to claim that the distribution of income is just.\nThey argue that in a competitive economy, workers get what they produce.\nMarxists, in contrast, use productivity to claim that the distribution of\nincome is unjust. They argue that in a capitalist economy, workers receive\nless than they produce (because capitalists extract a surplus).\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that these two opposing theories commit the same sin.\nThey define productivity in terms of income. Neoclassical economists do so\nexplicitly, as I\u2019ve described in this post. Marxists do so implicitly because\nthey haven\u2019t developed their own system of national accounts. Instead,\nMarxists who do empirical work use neoclassical measures of productivity (As\nan example, see this fascinating exchange between Paul Cockshott, Shimshon\nBichler and Jonathan Nitzan.)\n\nThe result of this circular definition is that the analysis of productivity is\na sleight of hand. \u2018Productivity\u2019 is just income relabelled.\n\nThe \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 is a textbook example of this relabelling. It\nclaims to show a growing gap between what workers \u2018produce\u2019 and what they get\npaid. But workers\u2019 \u2018productivity\u2019 is actually measured in terms of income \u2014\nthe average hourly income.\n\nThis relabelling of income gives the analysis ideological potency. Instead of\nsaying that workers\u2019 relative wages have declined, it says that workers don\u2019t\nget paid what they produce. The latter, as Marx long ago realized, is far more\npotent propaganda.\n\n### Productivity propaganda cuts both ways\n\nThe problem with productivity propaganda is that it cuts both ways. The EPI\nuses income to measure \u2018productivity\u2019 at the national level. But why stop\nthere? Why not equate income and productivity at the sector level, or at the\nindividual level? Curiously, the EPI warns against doing so (see the technical\nappendix here).\n\nThe problem is that the more finely we equate income with productivity, the\nmore we\u2019ll find that everyone \u2018gets what they produce\u2019. This is because as we\nstudy smaller and smaller groups, we remove the possibility of sampling\nsubgroups whose income diverges from the group\u2019s average income.\n\nAs a progressive think tank, the EPI wants to show that workers do not get\npaid what they produce. So it warns against equating income and productivity\nat the sector and individual level.\n\nThe problem is that the EPI wants to have its cake and eat it too. It wants to\nequate productivity with income when the results suit it \u2014 when the analysis\nshows a productivity-pay gap. But the more fine grain the analysis, the more\nthis gap will disappear. And so the EPI warns against equating income and\nproductivity at lower levels of analysis.\n\nTo be fair, the EPI is doing what many heterodox economists do. They reject\nthe \u2018crude\u2019 neoclassical assumption that individual income is equivalent to\nproductivity. Yet they then equate income and productivity at the national\nlevel.\n\nThis double standard is unjustifiable. Either we side with neoclassical theory\nand equate income and productivity wholesale. Or we reject neoclassical theory\nand so reject the accounting system that economists use to measure\nproductivity.\n\nMany heterodox economists are uncomfortable with the latter choice. And it\u2019s\nnot hard to see why. When you reject equating income and productivity, you\nreject the heart of macroeconomics. You reject the entire suite of measures\nthat macroeconomists use to measure economic output and productivity. In so\ndoing, you reject almost all that you (as a macroeconomist) are taught to hold\ndear. That\u2019s a scary prospect.\n\nThe uncomfortable fact, though, is that if we want to create an alternative to\nneoclassical economics, we can\u2019t use methods that have neoclassical\nassumptions baked into them. So a major part of being a heterodox economist is\nlooking for new ways to quantify the economy.\n\nLet\u2019s bring this post to a close. I\u2019m all for reducing inequality. And I think\nthat workers\u2019 wages have grown increasingly unfair. But I\u2019m also a hard-nosed\nscientist who dislikes analysis with dubious assumptions baked into it. For\nthat reason, I think the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 needs to be called what it\nactually is \u2014 a decline of workers\u2019 relative income.\n\n### Other posts on productivity and income\n\n  * No, Productivity Does Not Explain Income\n  * Productivity Does Not Explain Wages\n  * Productivity and Income ...

I\u2019m not sure I understand your question. But I\u2019ll try\nto answer as best I can.\n\nYou are right that the prices of manufactured goods have rise more slowly than\nthe price of services (the skyrocketing price of university tuition comes to\nmind).\n\nNow, what are the implications for the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019?\n\nThere are two ways to look at this. First, let\u2019s look at the \u2018productivity-pay\ngap\u2019 for what it actually is \u2014 a decline in the relative income of production\nworkers. This decline is unambiguous and unaffected by price change. By\n\u2018unaffected\u2019, I mean that we don\u2019t need to \u2018correct\u2019 for inflation to measure\nrelative income. Therefore, price change doesn\u2019t affect our measurement. That\nbeing said, changing prices play an important role in redistribution. So\nchanging prices are a (partial) cause of the declining relative income of\nworkers. If you\u2019re interested in how inflation relates to income\nredistribution, check out Jonathan Nitzan\u2019s seminal work:\nhttp://bnarchives.yorku.ca/207/\n\nSecond, we can treat the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 like the name suggests \u2014 as a\ngap between the productivity of workers and their \u2018real\u2019 wages. When we do\nthis, how we \u2018correct\u2019 for inflation becomes crucial to what we find. If, as\nthe EPI does, we think inflation is higher for the goods that workers consume\nthan for inflation in the whole economy, we\u2019ll find a larger \u2018productivity-pay\ngap\u2019.\n\nRemember, though, that this is just a semantics game. In reality we\u2019re still\njust comparing two types of income, adjusted by (arbitrary) price indexes.\n\nNow, you ask if the \u2018productivity-pay gap\u2019 is larger than economists think\nbecause of the growth of service sector prices. This isn\u2019t a question we can\nanswer objectively. Changes in relative prices cause ambiguity in the measure\nof productivity. If we account for this ambiguity, we get a large range of\npossible values (see this post:\nhttps://economicsfromthetopdown.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/real-gdp-the-flawed-\nmetric-at-the-heart-of-macroeconomics/). We need to stop thinking of\n\u2018productivity\u2019 as something that can be measured objectively. It\u2019s a\nconstruct. As such, our subjective choices effectively determine what we\u2019ll\nfind.\n\nAlso, I have a feeling that you are equating \u2018production workers\u2019 with\n\u2018manufacturing workers\u2019 (correct me if I\u2019m wrong). As measured by the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics, \u2018production workers\u2019 includes many occupations in the\nservice sector. So it\u2019s unclear what effect the rising prices of services\nwould have on production workers relative wages.\n\nTo close, income redistribution is intimately tied to differential price\nchange. But neither has anything to do with \u2018productivity\u2019.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n  3. Laurence Peterson says:\n\nJanuary 25, 2020 at 9:29 am\n\nThank you for your consistent reply. You are right: I persist in the\nconditioned response to \u201cproductivity\u201d, and should work harder to examine a\nproper critical response to its contradictions. Thanks for taking the time to\nanswer my \u201cquestion\u201d! In my own defense, I think I am motivated by the fact\nthat taking any kind of critical attitude towards the sacred notion of\nproductivity will mean nothing in a wider mainstream universe in which the\nidea remains unassailable, despite your best efforts.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n     * DUO says:\n\nJanuary 31, 2020 at 8:27 am\n\nThere is no problem with the concept of productivity provided you are very\nclear about what you mean by it. The problem is, as Blair and others have\nhighlighted, that economists really have no idea what they mean when they say\n\u201cproductivity.\u201d It\u2019s one of those Pavlovian reflexes that seems to exist for\nno other reason than reinforced habit. Because they have no clue what\nproductivity is, they inherently define it through the nominal domain (ie. in\nmarginal productivity theory, the marginal product of labor is, wait for it,\nyour wage!).\n\nHere\u2019s a provisional definition of productivity that does not depend on such\nabsurdities:\n\nProductivity is the expansion and diversification of useful forms of energy\n(like mechanical and electrical energy). So when productivity rises under\ncapitalism or any other economic system, what\u2019s rising is the amount of useful\nenergy deployed, or the number of ways in which it\u2019s deployed (ie. the\ndifferent tasks that it can do).\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n  4.

Enrique Velazco-Reckling says:\n\nMay 28, 2020 at 11:41 am\n\nAt the \u201cmicro level\u201d, wealth is created transforming a given set of inputs\ninto final products of higher value. The Value Added (VA) in the process is\nthe source for retribution to the various inputs: labor, capital, fixed\nassets, public services, etc. The \u201cPer Capita Income\u201d -the payroll (W) divided\nby the number of workers (PO), or mean wage-, is the fraction of the Value\nAdded destined to the payroll (W/VA), times the Labor Productivity (PL):\n\nmw = W/PO = (W/VA)*(VA/PO) = W/VA * PL (1)\n\nSo, the mean wage has two components: a \u201ctechnical\u201d component (labor\nproductivity at \u201cmarket values\u201d), and a \u201cpolitical\u201d one (the primary\ndistribution of income = labor share). While the first reflects market and\nproduction process\u2019 conditions, the second is highly discretional and reflects\nthe company\u2019s internal policies. No room for marginal productivity and related\nbs.\n\nSince the GDPpc is the product of the Labor Productivity times the fraction of\nworking to total population [GDPpc = PL * (PO/PT)], from (1) we get:\n\nGDPpc = (VA/W) * MW * (PO/PT) (2)\n\nEquation 2 means that GDPpc equals the ratio of VA to payroll (\u201cWage\nProductivity\u201d), times the \u201cmean wage\u201d, times the fraction of working to total\npopulation. Therefore, growth is directly proportional to VA and to the \u201cmean\nwage\u201d (buying power!); implies that for sustainable growth, gains in\nproductivity must be reflected in higher salaries, not only in larger profits.\nThis is the defining characteristic of all \u201cgood\u201d growth episodes.\n\nI posted this as \u201cdaneca\u201d in EuroTribune\nhttps://www.eurotrib.com/story/2008/3/3/123929/4440\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n     * Blair Fix says:\n\nMay 28, 2020 at 4:06 pm\n\nHi Enrique,\n\nThanks for your comments. Some thoughts ...\n\n> At the \u201cmicro level\u201d, wealth is created transforming a given set of inputs\n> into final products of higher value.\n\nI\u2019d restate this as: agents earn income by charging more for something than\nthey paid. That\u2019s a mathematical truism. That way we needn\u2019t worry about vague\nconcepts like \u2018wealth\u2019. What is \u2018wealth\u2019? Has a patent owner for a drug\ncreated \u2018wealth\u2019? What if they don\u2019t patent the drug, but instead give away\nthe knowledge for free? Then, in monetary terms, no \u2018wealth\u2019 was created.\n\nWealth isn\u2019t a thing it\u2019s an act. It\u2019s about enforcing property rights around\nsomething that other people want. See this post.\n\n> mw = W/PO = (W/VA)*(VA/PO) = W/VA * PL (1)\n>\n> So, the mean wage has two components: a \u201ctechnical\u201d component (labor\n> productivity at \u201cmarket values\u201d), and a \u201cpolitical\u201d one (the primary\n> distribution of income = labor share).

It\u2019s net income per labor hour (or\nper worker). I\u2019ve made this point in many posts (here, here and on the post on\nwhich we\u2019re commenting).\n\nWhat you\u2019re saying here is that the average wage depends on the following:\n\n1\\. workers\u2019 share of net income 2. net income per worker.\n\nNo one is going to argue with that. But there\u2019s no \u2018technical\u2019 component and\n\u2018political\u2019 component here. Both components are both technical and political.\nValue added consists of both the quantity of output and the unit price. Making\nmore quantity is technical. Charging more per unit is political. Since value\nadded is in both terms in your equation. each term is both technical and\npolitical. Unfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to separate these out, because it\u2019s\nimpossible to separate prices from quantities.\n\n> GDPpc = (VA/W) * MW * (PO/PT) (2)\n>\n> Equation 2 means that GDPpc equals the ratio of VA to payroll (\u201cWage\n> Productivity\u201d), times the \u201cmean wage\u201d, times the fraction of working to\n> total population.

This is the defining characteristic of all \u201cgood\u201d growth episodes.\n\nAgain, nothing wrong with your accounting definition here. It\u2019s fun to play\naround with these things, but they\u2019re only useful as tool for empirical\nresearch. Your identity states that GDP per capita can grow through 3\ndifferent paths:\n\n1\\. growth of value added (net income) relative to the wage bill 2. growth in\naverage wages 3. more people doing paid work\n\nUnfortunately, your identity says nothing about which terms are the most\nimportant. That\u2019s an empirical question.\n\nSaying that \u201cgrowth is directly proportional to value added\u201d is a misnomer.\nGrowth is defined in terms of value added \u2014 net income. Because of this\ndefinition, it\u2019s no surprise that the various forms of income are related to\nthe growth of GDP. They\u2019re related by an accounting definition.\n\nHere\u2019s how I would write it. GDP is defined as the sum of the wage bill and\nprofits:\n\nGDP = W + P\n\nGDP per labor hour is then:\n\nGDP/L = W/L + P/L\n\nSo GDP per labor hour equals the average wage (w) plus profit per labor hour.\n\nGDP/L = w + P/L\n\nAgain, this tells us nothing about how GDP per labor hour actual grows. It\njust tells us that it\u2019s growth can be broken into two components. And nothing\nin this equation has anything to do with productivity.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n  6.

When this is expense is included, the labor share of income\nhas decreased. When it is not included (in capitalist income) the labor share\nis constant. What is and is not included in the national accounts has always\nbeen arbitrary. So on that front, nothing has changed. Second, intellectual\nproperty is an important form of income, one that has grown over the 50 years.\nSo if you are interested in capitalist income (i.e. income from property\nrights) it makes little sense to exclude *intellectual* property rights.\n\nThat said, this paper speaks to the need for radical researchers to look at\nthe accounting procedures used by the national accounts.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n       * Yigal says:\n\nNovember 19, 2020 at 12:43 pm\n\nMany thanks for this, Blair.

On\nproductivity measurement, maybe we could discuss Alice mining with a shovel\nwhile Bob digs coal with a spoon (so prices are comparable).

But this is mostly important between\ncountries. Within countries the drive to costs (and the open flow of capital)\nusually levels out technology. So in the US,you don\u2019t see a person farming by\nhand alongside someone farming with a giant tractor. The hand-tool farmer was\ndriven out of business a long time ago.\n\nImportantly, according to neoclassical theory, this technology difference\ncomes down to capital. So it should be owners of capital (not workers) who\nshould see the return. That turns reality on its head. The whole reason the US\nis a wealthy country is that most people enjoy the fruits of technology, which\nis fed by massive energy flows.\n\nAbout useful work and GDP. Yes, they do intersect by 2000. But remember there\nis fundamental (unreport) uncertainty in GDP.

Clearly worker\nproductivity has gone up over the course of the past fifty years if only by\nvirtue of automated systems. Advancements in robotics and technology have very\nclearly created automated systems which allow far more productivity per labor\nhour. I think any math that shows otherwise is clearly manipulated.\n\nYou make the statement that technology is capital so it should benefit only\nthe capitalists. I find that fundamentally flawed in both a moral and ethical\nsense but also in a practical and historical sense.\n\nCoal mining is much less dangerous than it was fifty years ago because of\ntechnological advancements. Should we throw a few coal miners down some mine\nshafts since they don\u2019t deserve the benefit of the safety provided by the\ncapitalist technology? That\u2019s effectively your statement. Workers deserve no\nbenefit from capital therefore any benefit that drives from capital should not\nbe shared with workers.\n\nI find that gross. I think that there needs to be a symbiotic relationship\nbetween labor and capital instead of a combative divisive relationship that\nyou seem to be promoting.\n\nCapitalists deserve reward for creating automated systems and investing\ncapital but workers also deserve to benefit from this greater productivity\nthat is clearly absorbed through technological advancements and automated\nsystems.\n\nLoading...\n\n       * Blair Fix says:\n\nAugust 22, 2021 at 8:58 am\n\n> Coal mining is much less dangerous than it was fifty years ago because of\n> technological advancements.

There will always be some people who think they\u2019re not getting properly\ncompensated for their work, and conversely, those who do. Sometimes it\u2019s two\nemployees doing the same job, with the same pay, with one of them believing\nthey\u2019re paid appropriately, while the other does not.\n\nI believe there is a socioculture element to this. Ask someone from Russia if\nthey think $15 an hour is good pay and they would probably agree. Ask an\nAmerican, a good few will tell you it\u2019s not. Views on labor and an honest days\nwork vary from culture to culture, country to country, hell even state to\nstate.\n\nThere\u2019s also other variables, such as one\u2019s own personal health, their view on\nhow time should be spent, and how much of it should be spent on labor.\n\nIt\u2019s not just labor that you\u2019re trading for a paycheck, but also time. And I\nthink that not enough people realize that by working for a corporation,\nbusiness or government organization, you aren\u2019t just expending labor, but life\nitself. Time is, like it or not, a resource, time is life itself. You only\nhave a limited amount of it, and you can\u2019t get this resource back. And once\nyou run out of time, you run out of life.\n\nEveryday, about 37 percent of workers are expected to trade at least half of\nthe hours they have in a day for a paycheck. If you\u2019re working everyday, which\nsome do, that\u2019s half of your life spent laboring for the business you\u2019re\nworking for.\n\nSo, with 12 hours spent, you\u2019re only left with 4 of those hours to get\nanything else accomplished, provided you even have the energy to do anything\nelse besides maybe cook. This isn\u2019t even accounting for time driving, getting\nread for work, having breakfast, if there\u2019s time, getting kids ready for\nschool, getting them to bed, and other necessary tasks.\n\nThat is of course assuming you get 8 hours of sleep. Roughly, 40% of the\npopulace gets less than a full night\u2019s sleep. That\u2019s almost half of us.\nInterestingly enough, you are more likely to get a full 8 hours of sleep if\nyou work 12 hour shifts. Which makes sense, as you\u2019re so exhausted by the end\nof the day, that you need as much rest as you can possibly get in order to\nsurvive. Otherwise you\u2019re staring down heart disease, exhaustion, cancer, and\nother nasty surprises in your older age.\n\nSo it\u2019s not simply labor that we trade, we trade time, we trade health, and we\ntrade sleep, which correlates to health of course. Maybe not directly sleep,\nas that\u2019s ultimately down to choice, but many adults will lose sleep because\nthere simply aren\u2019t that many hours a day to accomplish much else,\nparticularly on a 12 hour shift. You may think 4 hours is a huge chunk of time\nfor someone, but you\u2019d be surprised as to small that window of time is to\naccomplish everything you need, and to have anything left at the end of the\nday besides maybe an hour of tv, or other forms of recreation. Which, is\nintegral to your mental well-being. A life spent doing busy work and nothing\nelse is not conducive to a healthy mind and body.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to quantify some of those things though, as your time is\nvaluable to you, but not the capitalist. Time is a valuable resource, the\nproblem is, its value is personal. That is to say, what time is left available\nto you. To a capitalist, the only time that is valuable is the time spent\nlaboring for them. But for you, an individual, a person, every hour of your\ntime spent is valuable.\n\nNow, a capitalist will tell you that time spent laboring is not time wasted,\nor even spent for that matter. Their argument being that every hour you labor\n= wage payment, therefor, it should, no matter how little, be considered\nvaluable and not a waste to you.\n\nAgain, this is largely subjective, because as I said before, individuals from\ndifferent sociocultural backgrounds, age, ethnicity, even gender, have their\nown view on what a fair wage is. But the average worker has no virtually\nnegotiation power whatsoever in determining the value of their work. Only a\nmathematical equation determines their value. This is where unions come into\nplay. They were created in order to give laborers more bargaining power than\n\u201cwork for corporation X, Y, or Z, for whatever pay they determine, or get\nnothing\u201d.\n\nWe can try and atomize them all they want, but people are people at the end of\nthe day, and how they feel about their work isn\u2019t going to be affected by a\nmathematical equation an economist created. So we create frameworks like\nunions in order to factor in the human element of labor relations. Yes, I am\naware capitalists are humans too, and they have their own ideas on what a fair\nwage should be. But the paradox in all of this is they develop frameworks and\nsystems which already dehumanize labor. They\u2019re people, yet they create\ninhumane mechanisms which determine compensation for work.\n\nAccording to the current paradigmn, employers are human, have freedom of\nchoice, and employees should simply agree to whatever terms they draw up, or\nwalk, regardless of their feelings on those terms.. If you\u2019re a capitalist,\nyou are afforded the freedom of choice, and humanity. If you\u2019re a laborer,\nyou\u2019re a machine, and your value is in how much profit you can generate for\ncapitalist.\n\nThat is the paradox of the modern working world. You, as a worker, are\nexpected to dehumanize and debase yourself on multiple levels, while at the\nsame time we\u2019re all expected to say \u201chey, that CEO is a human being. No one\ncan force him to pay a decent wage, because he has freedom. Also, it will hurt\nprofit margins\u201d. It\u2019s about as dehumanizing as any other autocracy, the only\ndifference is the false choice we\u2019re all given, to either work for one of the\nfew megacorps around, accept whatever terms they draw up, or starve. Forget\nabout starting a business that can even compete, or even having the startup\ncash to do it, because your only choices for any of that are to, wait for it,\nwork for one of the few megacorporations that exist.\n\nI don\u2019t have an answer to solve all of this. No equation or theory. The only\nthing I will say is, the problem of determing value and compensation is\nendemic to capitalism. Who decides value and how much your time is worth is\nalmost entirely decided by megaconglomerates. You have very little if any\nnegotiating power. Corporations, unlike people, do not negotiate anything. The\nstructure is entirely mechanical, and cannot be reasoned. The owners may be\nhuman, but for all intents and purposes, their organizations are not. So human\nbeings are not determining the value of labor. It\u2019s some equation set up which\nbroadly defines what labor value is. It does not take into account factors\nsuch as time needed for rest, hygene, recreation, child rearing, and other\nnecessary tasks. It also doesn\u2019t account for the cost of goods and services.\nIt is for all intents and purposes, entirely divorced from humanity.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n  23. Alex says:\n\nAugust 2, 2022 at 3:32 pm\n\nHi Blair. I really enjoyed your analysis.\n\nI think I\u2019d like to hazard a guess at why the EPI is comfortable equating\nincome and productivity at the national level, but not at the individual\nlevel. It has to do with seeing every transaction as two-sided: the receiving\nof income for the selling of whatever has been produced. Apologies if I spell\neverything out a little too much in this post, but I always enjoy coming\nacross things that spell everything out for the internet\u2019s silent observers,\nso I pass on the favor.\n\nSeeing every transaction as two-sided, in which there is a receiving of income\nfor whatever has been produced, is how it works at the aggregate level of the\nnational accounts. Everything sold is every bit of income. Everything sold was\nproduced, and therefore national income = national productivity.\n\nIf we hear out the counter-neoclassical folks\u2019 argument, it usually goes like\nthis: a worker\u2019s income is less than the price paid for what they produce. If\nyou are a baker in a bakery that employs three staff, each receiving $15 an\nhour (3 * $15 = $45/hr total wage cost), and the bakery sells on average 13\nloaves an hour at $5 each (13 * $5 = $65/hr gross income), and each loaf costs\n$0.50 in ingredients (13 * $0.50 = $6.50/hr cost of goods sold) and bakery-\nrent and utility bills are about $7.50 an hour (which isn\u2019t unreasonable:\n$7.50/hr * 8 hrs open per day * 6 days open per week * 4.3333 weeks in a month\n= $6.50 * 8 * 6 * 4.3333 = $1560 a month) then $65/hr gross income \u2013 $45/hr\nwages \u2013 $6.50/hr ingredients \u2013 $7.50/hr bills = $6/hr that goes to the bakery-\nbusiness-owner and that the workers aren\u2019t seeing, or $2/hr each.\n\nBut at the individual level, the above paragraph\u2019s situation isn\u2019t \u201cincome =\nproductivity\u201d for you and your fellow bakers. The way that workers\u2019 income =\nworkers\u2019 productivity here in line with the way we see the national accounts\nis if we cut it right down to saying that the $6/hr that goes to the bakery-\nowner and that the workers don\u2019t see is not being \u2018thieved\u2019 by the bakery-\nowner, but is instead the bakery-owners wage, received for their labor in e.g.\nfinding a location, being able to contact the commercial space\u2019s landlord,\nhaving enough capital at their disposal to pay all the upfront costs to start\nthe business, etc. From this, the workers are actually receiving the income\nfor their productivity that they bring to the bakery: they are producing a\ncertain amount of labor at a market-set price, and receiving the income for\nit, just in the same two-sided way as at the aggregate level.\n\nIt\u2019s just that, at this fine-grained level, the bakers\u2019 productivity is\ntherefore valued according to the demand/supply ratio of their labor. If there\nare more folks willing to work in a bakery for a lower wage, then labor will\nbe over-supplied, and the wage that the bakers receive will be less, meaning\nthat their labor is, following the \u2018two-sided transaction\u2019 accounting way of\nlooking at \u2018income = productivity\u2019, less productive.\n\nNow, obviously, when you claim that someone\u2019s labor is less productive because\ntheir wage has gone down, they will give you stink-eye. \u201cWhaddayamean,\u201d one of\nyour fellow bakers might say; \u201cI made that bread with my own hands.\u201d And the\npedant will say \u201cYes, but you didn\u2019t really produce the bread; you produced\nthe labor to make the bread, and the bakery-owner who leverages their social\nnetwork to find the commercial space and leverages their capital to pay all\nthe upfront costs produced, well, they produced all that, and the electricity\ncompany produced the electricity that powers the oven, and the farmer that\nsold us the grains produced the ingredients, and so on... and the bread sort\nof just... \u2018happened\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnd that, I think, is what\u2019s happening at the individual level, economically,\nif we look at individuals like we look at the aggregated national accounts:\nit\u2019s just, that math way of seeing it doesn\u2019t match how people intuitively\nunderstand the notion of \u201cproductivity.\u201d In fact, I\u2019m quite positive that if\nyou tell someone that their productivity has gone down because their income\nhas lowered, they\u2019ll think you\u2019re being deliberately absurd. If we look,\nkeeping in mind how people intuitively understand the notion of their\nproductivity, at the bakers\u2019 individual \u201cproductivity,\u201d then some smart-mouth\nPrussian with exuberant facial hair will say something very long, probably\nalong the lines of: \u201cThe bakery-owner was merely fortunate enough to have the\ncapital to pay all the upfront costs to set up the bakery business; unlike\nthose poor bakers, who could see the business opportunity, but lacked the\nmoney to do anything about it! And the bakery-owner was also merely fortunate\nenough to know the social landscape well-enough to contact the landlord and\nset up a contract for the bakery\u2019s commercial space; unlike those poor bakers,\nbecause landlords won\u2019t mingle with such lowly workers, as social networks are\nplainly not competitive markets in which everyone can freely interact with\neveryone else, and probably also because the people with enough disposable\ncapital to set up a bakery business keep meeting the landlords at those damn\nchampagne parties I\u2019m never invited to, where they talk shop how to make more\nmoney! And therefore, the bakery-owner was fortunate enough to have the\nopportunity to set up an enterprise in which they could pay the bakers less\nthan the amount of money the bread that they make is sold for! Which the\nbakery-owner can do because there are many more workers for hire as bakers\nthan there are bakery-owners, and all of those workers need money now, right\nthis instant \u2014 unlike the people who have enough saved up to start a bakery\nbusiness \u2014 because their stomachs are forever grumbling for bread! Bread that\nof course they will end up buying from the business-owner\u2019s bakery!\u201d\n\nAnd obviously, that smart-mouth Prussian\u2019s notion of productivity in his long-\nwinded diatribe looks nothing like the simple two-sided notion of productivity\nthat we use when we talk about the national accounts. When we look at the\nnational accounts, analogously, we\u2019re totting up all the bread being sold (as\nthe \u201cfinal goods\u201d), i.e. what the economy is literally producing, and looking\nat the difference between that and what the bakers are getting paid. I think\nthe reason the EPI is comfortable talking about productivity is because\nthey\u2019ve made a convenient semantic fudging in which the \u201ctwo-sided\u201d\n\u2018accounting\u2019 definition of productivity is being used at the national accounts\nlevel, but the \u201cintuitive\u201d definition of productivity is being used to explain\nthe difference between how much bread is being sold and how much the bakers\nare being paid.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a difficult fudging to un-fudge, I think, because it\u2019s more of a\nphilosophical question than a mathematical one, and in my experience at least,\nwhen you say words like \u201cphilosophy\u201d within earshot of many (note: only\n\u2018many\u2019) economists, they frown and fold their arms and point vigorously at\nequations and graphs and say \u201cwe do math here, not interpretation!\u201d and in\ndoing so, heavily imply without realizing it that the way that they have\nconverted into workable mathematics what the average everyday agent of the\neconomy considers to be \u2018reality\u2019 (such as the notion of \u201cproductivity\u201d) is\nperfectly legitimate \u2014 which of course is a ginormous philosophical claim.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s a fudging that seems baked into microeconomics, too: when we\ndo equations about the marginal productivity of bakers, we ask things like\n\u201chow many loaves of bread the next baker can produce\u201d, which is far closer to\nthe \u201cintuitive\u201d way of seeing productivity than it is to the \u201ctwo-sided\ntransaction\u201d way of seeing it that macroeconomics\u2019 national accounts employs.\nSo maybe the EPI isn\u2019t being sneaky; maybe it\u2019s just missing the fudging as\nmuch as microeconomists seem to be, too. It seems more reasonable to give both\nparties the benefit of the doubt, more than believing that the EPI is playing\ndishonest hardball in the name of getting the poor a decent paycheck.\n\nAll this said, I agree with you that counter-neoclassical folks are continuing\nto adopt neoclassical assumptions, despite their feelings towards\nneoclassicism, and that this is problematic. The assumption adopted by \u2018both\nsides\u2019 (for want of a better phrase) in the above is this: that adding a unit\nof labor somehow corresponds with the amount that the laborer produces. This\nunderpins the marginalist interpretation of productivity, as in the preceding\nparagraph, when we ask \u201chow many loaves of bread can a baker produce.\u201d\nFurthermore, microeconomists often then say that if bakers produce more bread\nthan they cost, then bakery-owners will simply hire more bakers to make more\nbread; but then also, conveniently invoking the opposite way of thinking \u2014 the\n\u201cwhole more than the sum of its parts\u201d approach \u2014 for a brief moment, the\nmicroeconomists say that each successive baker\u2019s productivity diminishes\nwithin the whole set-up of the bakery, and eventually you will reach a point\nwhere the cost of the next baker matches the additional amount of bread they\nbake to be sold. Firstly, and this isn\u2019t groundbreaking, surely every\nmicroeconomist is on board with this: that sounds like an argument founded on\ncontinuous variables and obviously bakers and bread-loaves are discrete\nvariables; you can\u2019t slice a baker in half so you only need to pay them half\ntheir wage and still have them able to make bread. If hiring three bakers is\nprofitable but hiring four bakers is not, there is almost-certainly an in-\nbetween point, where the wage-cost of three bakers is lower than the gross\nincome from selling three bakers\u2019 worth of bread baked minus the cost of\ninputs, which nets a profit to the bakery-owner, but the wage-cost of four\nbakers is higher than the gross income from selling four bakers\u2019 worth of\nbread baked minus cost of inputs, netting a loss to the bakery-owner. The\ndifference between the \u201cgross income from selling three bakers\u2019 worth of bread\nbaked minus cost of inputs\u201d and \u201cthe cost of hiring three bakers\u201d is the\nbakery-owner\u2019s profit. But, leaving that to one side (because like I said,\nmicroeconomists surely accept it), the \u201cjust hire another worker if they\u2019re\ncheap\u201d dynamic also just doesn\u2019t match the real world. How does the bakery-\nowner know what hiring another person is going to do to the amount of bread\nproduced? They would need to expend further costly effort rearranging the\nwhole business and re-dividing the labor, which hasn\u2019t factored into the \u201cjust\nhire another worker if they\u2019re cheap\u201d dynamic. And, can an extra employee\u2019s\nproduced loaves even fit in the oven? The owner may need to hire more capital:\na bigger oven, or a larger commercial space, which doesn\u2019t seem factored into\nthe \u201cjust hire another worker\u201d dynamic either. Or, and this is the biggie: how\ndoes the bakery-owner even know that if they ramp up production, people are\ngoing to buy more bread? If the market has set the demand of 13 loaves per\nhour at $6 for each loaf, and three bakers can supply it, and the labor market\nhas set the price for bakers at $15 an hour, then nothing really seems like it\nneeds to change. We can say to this, \u201cOh but then the bakery has leeway to\nlower the price of their bread to stimulate people to buy more of it,\u201d but\nthen, why would they? What if lowering the cost of the bread by 1% from $5 to\n$4.95 ( *13 sold per hr = $64.35/hr gross income \u2013 $45/hr wages \u2013 $6.50/hr\ningredients \u2013 $7.50/hr bills = $5.34/hr to the bakery-owner) doesn\u2019t increase\nhourly sales by 12.2% (which is somewhat expected, because 12.2 is an insane\nprice elasticity of demand), which is the increase in sales the bakery-owner\nwould need in order to make the same profit as when the bread was sold at $5 a\nloaf, because $5.34/hr * (100% + 12.2%) = $6.00 to the bakery-owner again. And\nthat\u2019s not even taking into account that perhaps $0.05 isn\u2019t enough to really\nget consumers to go out of their way to go to that bakery, because it\u2019s not\nlike the real estate market for bakeries\u2019 placement is a perfectly competitive\nmarket in which consumers can just teleport to whichever bakery gives them the\nbest price...\n\nMicroeconomics aside, getting back to the assumption that adding a unit of\nlabor somehow corresponds with the amount that the laborer produces: this\nassumption also underpins the argument of the folks who talk about bakers\ngetting ripped off at work. Those folks assume that the bakery actually makes\n$65/hr gross income \u2013 $6.50/hr ingredients \u2013 $7.50/hr bills = $51/hr income,\nand that each baker brings $51/hr \u00f7 3 bakers = $17/hr worth of value to work,\nbut is being passively coerced out of that extra $2 over the $15/hr they\u2019re\nactually receiving, and they have entered into this arrangement because they\neach face a choice: a choice between entering into an exploitative working\narrangement such as this one, and dying from not putting enough bread in their\nstomach, which they need wages for, so they can buy the bread. And, as we\nalready know from our macroeconomics, and from Keynes railing on about the\nfallacy of composition, the whole usually works slightly differently from\nmerely the sum of its parts. To say that the $65/hr gross income can be broken\ndown into neat divisions like both the marginalists and the counter-\nneoclassicists imply is to say that the value created at the bakery has\neverything to do with the individual elements of the bakery and nothing to do\nwith their arrangement. In my view, that\u2019s contrary to the very idea of trade\nin the first place, in which we rearrange the ownership of parts to create a\nmore valuable whole (which we can then trade onward, if we choose to). Wholes\n\u2018pop out\u2019 of rearranged parts. In other words: maybe the bread does \u201cjust\nhappen.\u201d\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n     * Blair Fix says:\n\nAugust 5, 2022 at 8:29 am\n\nHi Alex,\n\nThanks for your thought-provoking comment. I think you have hit on the crux of\nthe problem, which is the duality inherent in economics \u2014 the idea that prices\nquantify both income and output at once.\n\nAs you note, both macro and micro economics are built on this duality. But the\nproblems are easier to spot at the micro (individual) level, where output\n(sometimes) has a natural unit (loaves of bread, as in your baker example). At\nthe national level, the problems are far harder to spot, largely because it is\ndifficult to visualize \u2018aggregate production\u2019 (whatever that means).\n\nThe result is that few heterodox economists are comfortable equating income\nwith productivity at the individual level. But they still do it at the\nnational level. As you observe, it is a philosophical issue. It is also an\nissue of rhetoric.\n\nAs Marx long ago realized, saying that workers are paid less than they produce\nis incendiary rhetoric ... far more captivating that saying that income\ninequality has increased.\n\nLoading...\n\nReply\n\n  24.
