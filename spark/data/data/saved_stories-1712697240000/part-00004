How can we make social skill training more available,\n> accessible, and inviting? Drawing upon interdisciplinary research from\n> communication and psychology, this perspective paper identifies social skill\n> barriers to enter specialized fields. Then we present a solution that\n> leverages large language models for social skill training via a generic\n> framework. Our AI Partner, AI Mentor framework merges experiential learning\n> with realistic practice and tailored feedback. This work ultimately calls\n> for cross-disciplinary innovation to address the broader implications for\n> workforce development and social equality.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Human-Computer Interaction\n(cs.HC)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.04204 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.04204v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Caleb Ziems [view email] [v1] Fri, 5 Apr 2024 16:29:58 UTC (498 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Social Skill Training with Large Language\nModels, by Diyi Yang and 5 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.HC\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
