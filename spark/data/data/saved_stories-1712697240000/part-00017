This was back in the early part of the last decade, when it\nwas still airing on its original run. It took me years to get round to\nwatching the show, partly because of my discomfort with the post-Sopranos\nvogue for anti-heroes, but I finally did so in 2022, and must confess that the\nbuzz was justified. The misadventures of Walter White are truly Shakespearean.\nBreaking Bad \u2014 along with its even better prequel Better Call Saul \u2014 confirmed\nthat television drama was a legitimate art form in its own right, which could\ncombine superb longform storytelling with visual innovation, music, and sound\ndesign in a unique way.\n\n> Sherlock was just not that good; certainly not as good as it thought it was\n\nAll that said, it is wise to maintain a certain amount of scepticism about\nsmall screen hype. Take something like Sherlock, which was inescapable for a\nwhile, in those long-forgotten far-off days of the Lib Dem-Tory Coalition and\nBonkers Boris hosting the London Olympics and British membership of the EU.\nCritics raved about how sharp and smart it was, with its use of on-screen\ngraphics to depict Sherlock\u2019s thought processes, and to visualise the detailed\nanatomic knowledge with which he won fights against physically superior foes.\nThere were fun touches like replacing \u201cthree pipe problem\u201d with \u201cthree patch\nproblem\u201d (we couldn\u2019t have our hero smoke tobacco in the Current Year!) and\nmaintaining Watson\u2019s backstory as an ex-military doctor injured in\nAfghanistan. The series was astonishingly successful in commercial terms,\nhelped by a strong cast \u2014 leads Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman were\nboth on the cusp of global stardom \u2014 and managed a respectable haul of BAFTAs\nand Emmys.\n\nBut looking back, now that the caravan has moved on, it must be said that\nSherlock was just not that good; certainly not as good as it thought it was.\nAs with many of Steven Moffat\u2019s creations, it was palpably preoccupied with\nits own cleverness, to the detriment of delivering satisfyingly coherent\nplots. This tendency reached an absolute nadir in \u201cThe Empty Hearse\u201d, episode\none of the third series, when Moffat and his co-writer Mark Gatiss flat out\nrefused to properly resolve the \u201cimpossible mystery\u201d they had set up in the\nfinal episode of the second series, \u201cThe Reichenbach Fall\u201d, eighteen months\npreviously. In that episode, Holmes faked his own death, and in \u201cThe Empty\nHearse\u201d various characters in-universe offered different possible solutions,\nof varying levels of plausibility, but the viewer was never actually told how\nthe trick had been worked. As any fan of detective fiction will tell you, this\nis a cop-out. Doubtless Moffat or his supporters would defend this non-\nsolution as a kind of postmodern flourish, a little knowing joke about the\nartifice of locked-room mysteries or the fervent speculation that had gripped\nSherlock\u2019s fandom in the long gap between the second and third series. But I\ndon\u2019t think people generally tune into TV adaptations of Sherlock Holmes\nstories to have their expectations of whodunits subverted.\n\nSherlock also suffered from Moffat\u2019s love of convoluted plot arcs with almost\ncomically high stakes, meaning that only a few of the episodes were focused on\na single self-contained mystery which the master detective used his gifts of\nlogic and deduction to solve.\n\nI don\u2019t want to just pick on Sherlock. But it is one of the outstanding\nexamples from recent years of a TV product which was slickly packaged and\nhigh-concept and somehow zeigeisty, but in retrospect lacking in substance and\nenduring interest. Nearly twenty years ago I remember enjoying the first two\nor three series of Lost, before becoming frustrated with its \u201cmystery box\u201d\nstorytelling, in which countless riddles and enigmas are posed to the viewer\nto keep them hooked, but either never explained, or explained in a very\nimplausible and unsatisfactory way. Like the Moffat-Gatiss jiggery-pokery\nnoted above, this comes across as a violation of the implicit contract between\naudience and programme-maker that our attention and loyalty will be rewarded\nby thoughtful resolutions.\n\nThe 2004 reboot of Battlestar Galactica was critically acclaimed and much\nlauded in the media for its tackling of contentious issues, but on rewatch\nmany of the analogies and allusions to then-contemporary events like the\ninsurgency in Iraq feel laboured and tenuous. The streaming era, with its huge\nexpansion in the production of would-be \u201cprestige television\u201d, depends on new\nshows being heavily publicised and constantly hyped as the next Sopranos or\nthe next Succession, or the first Star Wars content to feature a female main\nprotagonist or a gay couple or what have you, but most of them turn out to be\nforgettable, or start strongly before flaming out into repetition and tedium\n(as happened to the initially intriguing The Mandalorian). The hard fact is\nthat the critical and social media demand for brilliant and insightful new TV\nconsiderably exceeds the supply.\n\n> Friends, for example ... has aged poorly\n\nEven shows that were genuinely very good and culturally influential can seem\nless entertaining and even rather flat on subsequent viewings. Friends, for\nexample, though apparently still popular in reruns with people who weren\u2019t\neven born when it ended in 2004, has aged poorly. Its style and vibe seems\nclosely bound to a particular time and place and lifestyle. This is not, by\nand large, the case for its close contemporary Frasier. Aaron Sorkin\u2019s The\nWest Wing has been much imitated and does reward revisiting, but the world it\nportrays already appears impossibly remote, only two decades on.\n\nThe passage of time has its own curious alchemy, of rendering the seemingly\nessential and unmissable trivial and slight, and exposing media fashions as\nthe mere fancies of a passing moment. It is sad, really, to think how little\nof the cultural production of any given moment will truly endure in the medium\n\u2014 to long-term, to shape the perceptions and folk memory of eras yet to come \u2014\nand curious to reflect on the perhaps unexpected survivals. During the Covid\nlockdowns I rewatched One Foot In The Grave, which finished nearly a quarter\nof a century ago, and was struck by how essentially timeless and universal it\nfelt. The same can be said for some classic documentaries, even those produced\nfifty or sixty years ago like The Great War and Civilisation, and tightly-\nwritten dramas like Colditz or Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Does anyone truly\nknow the secret of unfailing resonance and lasting impact? I suspect not, but\nthe ruthless and relentless process of cultural forgetfulness has something to\nteach us all about humility.\n\nShare\n\n## Enjoying The Critic online?
