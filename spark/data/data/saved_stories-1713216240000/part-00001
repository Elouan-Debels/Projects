The\nconcept exists in both in natural language and programming languages though in\ndifferent forms. In natural language, the readability of text depends on its\ncontent (the complexity of its vocabulary and syntax) and its presentation\n(such as typographic aspects that affect legibility, like font size, line\nheight, character spacing, and line length).^[1] In programming, things such\nas programmer comments, choice of loop structure, and choice of names can\ndetermine the ease with which humans can read computer program code.\n\nHigher readability in a text eases reading effort and speed for the general\npopulation of readers. For those who do not have high reading comprehension,\nreadability is necessary for understanding and applying a given text.\nTechniques to simplify readability are essential to communicate a set of\ninformation to the intended audience.^[2] Whether it is code, news\ninformation, or storytelling, every writer has a target audience that they\nhave to adjust their readability levels to.\n\n## Definition[edit]\n\nDifferent definitions of readability exist from various sources. The term\n\"readability\" is inherently broad and can become confusing when examining all\nof the possible definitions.^[3] Readability is a concept that involves\naudience, content, quality, legibility, and can even involve the formatting\nand design structure of any given text.^[4] Therefore, the definition can\nfluctuate based on the type of audience to whom one is presenting a certain\ntype of content to. For example, a technical writer might focus on clear and\nconcise language and formatting that allows easy-reading. In contrast, a\nscholarly journal would use sophisticated writing that would appeal and make\nsense to the type of audience to whom they are directing information to.\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\nReadability is essential to the clarity and accessibility of texts used in\nclassrooms, work environments, and everyday life. The government prioritizes\nreadability as well through Plain Language Laws which enforces important\ndocuments to be written at an 8th grade level.^[5]\n\nMuch research has focused on matching prose to reading skill, resulting in\nformulas for use in research, government, teaching, publishing, the military,\nmedicine, and business.^[6]^[7]\n\n### Readability and Newspaper Readership[edit]\n\nSeveral studies in the 1940s showed that even small increases in readability\ngreatly increases readership in large-circulation newspapers.\n\nIn 1947, Donald Murphy of Wallace's Farmer used a split-run^[8] edition to\nstudy the effects of making text easier to read. He found that reducing from\nthe 9th to the 6th-grade reading level increased readership by 43% for an\narticle about 'nylon'. He also found a 60% increase in readership for an\narticle on corn, with better responses from people under 35.^[8]The result was\na gain of 42,000 readers in a circulation of 275,000.\n\nWilber Schramm, who directed the Communications Research program at the\nUniversity of Illinois interviewed 1,050 newspaper readers in 1947. He found\nthat an easier reading style helps to determine how much of an article is\nread. This was called reading persistence, depth, or perseverance He also\nfound that people will read less of long articles than of short ones, for\nexample, a story nine paragraphs long will lose 3 out of 10 readers by the\nfifth paragraph. In contrast, a shorter story will lose only 2 out of 10\nreaders.^[9]\n\nA study in 1947 by Melvin Lostutter showed that newspapers were generally\nwritten at a level five years above the ability of average American adult\nreaders. The reading ease of newspaper articles was not found to have much\nconnection with the education, experience, or personal interest of the\njournalists writing the stories. It instead had more to do with the convention\nand culture of the industry. Lostutter argued for more readability testing in\nnewspaper writing. Improved readability must be a \"conscious process somewhat\nindependent of the education and experience of the staffs writers.\"^[10]\n\nIn 1948, Bernard Feld did a study of every item and ad in the Birmingham News\nof 20 November 1947. He divided the items into those above the 8th-grade level\nand those at the 8th grade or below. He chose the 8th-grade breakpoint, as\nthat was determined to be the average reading level of adult readers. An 8th-\ngrade text \"...will reach about 50% of all American grown-ups,\" he wrote.\nAmong the wire-service stories, the lower group got two-thirds more readers,\nand among local stories, 75% more readers. Feld also believed in drilling\nwriters in Flesch's clear-writing principles.^[11]\n\nBoth Rudolf Flesch and Robert Gunning worked extensively with newspapers and\nthe wire services in improving readability. Mainly through their efforts in a\nfew years, the readability of US newspapers went from the 16th to the 11th-\ngrade level, where it remains today.\n\nThe two publications with the largest circulations, TV Guide (13 million) and\nReader's Digest (12 million), are written at the 9th-grade level.^[12] The\nmost popular novels are written at the 7th-grade level. This supports the fact\nthat the average adult reads at the 9th-grade level. It also shows that, for\nrecreation, people read texts that are two grades below their actual reading\nlevel.^[13]\n\n## Early Research[edit]\n\nIn the 1880s, English professor L. A. Sherman found that the English sentence\nwas getting shorter. In Elizabethan times, the average sentence was 50 words\nlong while in Sherman's modern time, it was 23 words long.\n\nSherman's work established that:\n\n  * Literature is a subject for statistical analysis.\n  * Shorter sentences and concrete terms help people to make sense of what is written.\n  * Speech is easier to understand than text.\n  * Over time, text becomes easier if it is more like speech.\n\nSherman wrote: \"No man should talk worse than he writes, no man should write\nbetter than he should talk...\" He wrote this wanting to emphasize that the\ncloser writing is to speech, the more clear and effective the content\nbecomes.^[14]\n\nIn 1889 in Russia, the writer Nikolai A. Rubakin published a study of over\n10,000 texts written by everyday people.^[15] From these texts, he took 1,500\nwords he thought most people understood. He found that the main blocks to\ncomprehension are unfamiliar words and long sentences.^[16] Starting with his\nown journal at the age of 13, Rubakin published many articles and books on\nscience and many subjects for the great numbers of new readers throughout\nRussia. In Rubakin's view, the people were not fools. They were simply poor\nand in need of cheap books, written at a level they could grasp.^[15]\n\nIn 1921, Harry D. Kitson published The Mind of the Buyer, one of the first\nbooks to apply psychology to marketing. Kitson's work showed that each type of\nreader bought and read their own type of text. On reading two newspapers and\ntwo magazines, he found that short sentence length and short word length were\nthe best contributors to reading ease.^[17]\n\n## Text Leveling[edit]\n\nThe earliest reading ease assessment is the subjective judgment termed text\nleveling. Formulas do not fully address the various content, purpose, design,\nvisual input, and organization of a text.^[18]^[19]Text leveling is commonly\nused to rank the reading ease of texts in areas where reading difficulties are\neasy to identify, such as books for young children. At higher levels, ranking\nreading ease becomes more difficult, as individual difficulties become harder\nto identify. This has led to better ways to assess reading ease.\n\n## Vocabulary Frequency Lists[edit]\n\nIn the 1920s, the scientific movement in education looked for tests to measure\nstudents' achievement to aid in curriculum development. Teachers and educators\nhad long known that, to improve reading skill, readers\u2014especially beginning\nreaders\u2014need reading material that closely matches their ability. University-\nbased psychologists did much of the early research, which was later taken up\nby textbook publishers.^[20]\n\nEducational psychologist Edward Thorndike of Columbia University noted that,\nin Russia and Germany, teachers used word frequency counts to match books to\nstudents. Word skill was the best sign of intellectual development, and the\nstrongest predictor of reading ease. In 1921, Thorndike published Teachers\nWord Book, which contained the frequencies of 10,000 words.^[21] It made it\neasier for teachers to choose books that matched class reading skills. It also\nprovided a basis for future research on reading ease.\n\nUntil computers came along, word frequency lists were the best aids for\ngrading reading ease of texts.^[13] In 1981 the World Book Encyclopedia listed\nthe grade levels of 44,000 words.^[22]A popular strategy amongst educators in\nmodern times is \"incidental vocabulary learning,\" which enforces efficiency in\nlearning vocabulary in the short-term rather than drilling words and meanings\nteachers hope will stick.^[23] The incidental learning tactic is meant to help\nlearners build comprehension and learning skills rather than memorizing words.\nThrough this strategy, students would hopefully be able to navigate various\nlevels of readability using context clues and comprehension.\n\n## Early Children's Readability Formulas[edit]\n\nIn 1923, Bertha A. Lively and Sidney L. Pressey published the first reading\nease formula. They were concerned that junior high school science textbooks\nhad so many technical words and that teachers would spend all class time\nexplaining these words. They argued that their formula would help to measure\nand reduce the \"vocabulary burden\" of textbooks. Their formula used five\nvariable inputs and six constants. For each thousand words, it counted the\nnumber of unique words, the number of words not on the Thorndike list, and the\nmedian index number of the words found on the list. Manually, it took three\nhours to apply the formula to a book.^[24]\n\nAfter the Lively\u2013Pressey study, people looked for formulas that were more\naccurate and easier to apply. In 1928, Carleton Washburne and Mabel Vogel\ncreated the first modern readability formula. They validated it by using an\noutside criterion, and correlated .845 with test scores of students who read\nand liked the criterion books.^[25] It was also the first to introduce the\nvariable of interest to the concept of readability.^[26]\n\nBetween 1929 and 1939, Alfred Lewerenz of the Los Angeles School District\npublished several new formulas.^[27]^[28]^[29]^[30]^[31]\n\nIn 1934, Edward Thorndike published his formula. He wrote that word skills can\nbe increased if the teacher introduces new words and repeats them often.^[32]\nIn 1939, W.W. Patty and W. I Painter published a formula for measuring the\nvocabulary burden of textbooks. This was the last of the early formulas that\nused the Thorndike vocabulary-frequency list.^[33]\n\n## Early Adult Readability Formulas[edit]\n\nDuring the recession of the 1930s, the U.S. government invested in adult\neducation. In 1931, Douglas Waples and Ralph Tyler published What Adults Want\nto Read About. It was a two-year study of adult reading interests. Their book\nshowed not only what people read but what they would like to read. They found\nthat many readers lacked suitable reading materials: they would have liked to\nlearn but the reading materials were too hard for them.^[34]\n\nLyman Bryson of Teachers College, Columbia University found that many adults\nhad poor reading ability due to poor education. Even though colleges had long\ntried to teach how to write in a clear and readable style, Bryson found that\nit was rare. He wrote that such language is the result of a \"...discipline and\nartistry that few people who have ideas will take the trouble to achieve... If\nsimple language were easy, many of our problems would have been solved long\nago.\"^[13] Bryson helped set up the Readability Laboratory at the college. Two\nof his students were Irving Lorge and Rudolf Flesch.\n\nIn 1934, Ralph Ojemann investigated adult reading skills, factors that most\ndirectly affect reading ease, and causes of each level of difficulty. He did\nnot invent a formula, but a method for assessing the difficulty of materials\nfor parent education. He was the first to assess the validity of this method\nby using 16 magazine passages tested on actual readers. He evaluated 14\nmeasurable and three reported factors that affect reading ease.\n\nOjemann emphasized the reported features, such as whether the text was\ncoherent or unduly abstract. He used his 16 passages to compare and judge the\nreading ease of other texts, a method now called scaling. He showed that even\nthough these factors cannot be measured, they cannot be ignored.^[35]\n\nAlso in 1934, Ralph Tyler and Edgar Dale published the first adult reading\nease formula based on passages on health topics from a variety of textbooks\nand magazines. Of 29 factors that are significant for young readers, they\nfound ten that are significant for adults. They used three of these in their\nformula.^[36]\n\nIn 1935, William S. Gray of the University of Chicago and Bernice Leary of\nXavier College in Chicago published What Makes a Book Readable, one of the\nmost important books in readability research. Like Dale and Tyler, they\nfocused on what makes books readable for adults of limited reading ability.\nTheir book included the first scientific study of the reading skills of\nAmerican adults. The sample included 1,690 adults from a variety of settings\nand regions. The test used a number of passages from newspapers, magazines,\nand books\u2014as well as a standard reading test. They found a mean grade score of\n7.81 (eighth month of the seventh grade). About one-third read at the 2nd to\n6th-grade level, one-third at the 7th to 12th-grade level, and one-third at\nthe 13th\u201317th grade level.\n\nThe authors emphasized that one-half of the adult population at that time\nlacked suitable reading materials. They wrote, \"For them, the enriching values\nof reading are denied unless materials reflecting adult interests are adapted\nto their needs.\" The poorest readers, one-sixth of the adult population, need\n\"simpler materials for use in promoting functioning literacy and in\nestablishing fundamental reading habits.\"^[37]\n\nGray and Leary then analyzed 228 variables that affect reading ease and\ndivided them into four types:\n\n  * Content\n  * Style\n  * Format\n  * Organization\n\nThey found that content was most important, followed closely by style. Third\nwas format, followed closely by organization. They found no way to measure\ncontent, format, or organization\u2014but they could measure variables of style.\nAmong the 17 significant measurable style variables, they selected five to\ncreate a formula:\n\n  * Average sentence length\n  * Number of different hard words\n  * Number of personal pronouns\n  * Percentage of unique words\n  * Number of prepositional phrases\n\nTheir formula had a correlation of .645 with comprehension as measured by\nreading tests given to about 800 adults.^[37]\n\nIn 1939, Irving Lorge published an article that reported other combinations of\nvariables that indicate difficulty more accurately than the ones Gray and\nLeary used. His research also showed that, \"The vocabulary load is the most\nimportant concomitant of difficulty.\"^[38] In 1944, Lorge published his Lorge\nIndex, a readability formula that used three variables and set the stage for\nsimpler and more reliable formulas that followed.^[39]\n\nBy 1940, investigators had:\n\n  * Successfully used statistical methods to analyze reading ease\n  * Found that unusual words and sentence length were among the first causes of reading difficulty\n  * Used vocabulary and sentence length in formulas to predict reading ease\n\n## Popular Readability Formulas[edit]\n\n### The Flesch Formulas[edit]\n\nMain article: Flesch\u2013Kincaid readability tests\n\nIn 1943, Rudolf Flesch published his PhD dissertation, Marks of a Readable\nStyle, which included a readability formula to predict the difficulty of adult\nreading material. Investigators in many fields began using it to improve\ncommunications. One of the variables it used was personal references, such as\nnames and personal pronouns. Another variable was affixes.^[40]\n\nIn 1948, Flesch published his Reading Ease formula in two parts. Rather than\nusing grade levels, it used a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 equivalent to the\n12th grade and 100 equivalent to the 4th grade. It dropped the use of affixes.\nThe second part of the formula predicts human interest by using personal\nreferences and the number of personal sentences. The new formula correlated\n0.70 with the McCall-Crabbs reading tests.^[41] The original formula is:\n\n    \n\nReading Ease score = 206.835 \u2212 (1.015 \u00d7 ASL) \u2212 (84.6 \u00d7 ASW)\n\n    Where: ASL = average sentence length (number of words divided by number of sentences)\n    ASW = average word length in syllables (number of syllables divided by number of words)\n\nPublishers discovered that the Flesch formulas could increase readership up to\n60%. Flesch's work also made an enormous impact on journalism. The Flesch\nReading Ease formula became one of the most widely used, tested, and reliable\nreadability metrics.^[42]^[43] In 1951, Farr, Jenkins, and Patterson\nsimplified the formula further by changing the syllable count. The modified\nformula is:\n\n    \n\nNew reading ease score = 1.599nosw \u2212 1.015sl \u2212 31.517\n\n    Where: nosw = number of one-syllable words per 100 words and\n    sl = average sentence length in words.^[44]\n\nIn 1975, in a project sponsored by the U.S. Navy, the Reading Ease formula was\nrecalculated to give a grade-level score. The new formula is now called the\nFlesch\u2013Kincaid grade-level formula.^[45] The Flesch\u2013Kincaid formula is one of\nthe most popular and heavily tested formulas. It correlates 0.91 with\ncomprehension as measured by reading tests.^[12]\n\n### The Dale\u2013Chall Formula[edit]\n\nMain article: Dale\u2013Chall readability formula\n\nEdgar Dale, a professor of education at Ohio State University, was one of the\nfirst critics of Thorndike's vocabulary-frequency lists. He claimed that they\ndid not distinguish between the different meanings that many words have. He\ncreated two new lists of his own. One, his \"short list\" of 769 easy words, was\nused by Irving Lorge in his formula. The other was his \"long list\" of 3,000\neasy words, which were understood by 80% of fourth-grade students. However,\none has to extend the word lists by regular plurals of nouns, regular forms of\nthe past tense of verbs, progressive forms of verbs etc. In 1948, he\nincorporated this list into a formula he developed with Jeanne S. Chall, who\nlater founded the Harvard Reading Laboratory.\n\nTo apply the formula:\n\n  1. Select several 100-word samples throughout the text.\n  2. Compute the average sentence length in words (divide the number of words by the number of sentences).\n  3. Compute the percentage of words NOT on the Dale\u2013Chall word list of 3,000 easy words.\n  4. Compute this equation from 1948:\n\n    Raw score = 0.1579*(PDW) + 0.0496*(ASL) if the percentage of PDW is less than 5%, otherwise compute\n    Raw score = 0.1579*(PDW) + 0.0496*(ASL) + 3.6365\n\nWhere:\n\n    Raw score = uncorrected reading grade of a student who can answer one-half of the test questions on a passage.\n    PDW = Percentage of difficult words not on the Dale\u2013Chall word list.\n    ASL = Average sentence length\n\nFinally, to compensate for the \"grade-equivalent curve\", apply the following\nchart for the Final Score:\n\nRaw score| Final score  \n---|---  \n4.9 and below| Grade 4 and below  \n5.0\u20135.9| Grades 5\u20136  \n6.0\u20136.9| Grades 7\u20138  \n7.0\u20137.9| Grades 9\u201310  \n8.0\u20138.9| Grades 11\u201312  \n9.0\u20139.9| Grades 13\u201315 (college)  \n10 and above| Grades 16 and above.  \n  \n^[46]\n\nIn 1995, Dale and Chall published a new version of their formula with an\nupgraded word list, the New Dale\u2013Chall readability formula.^[47] Its formula\nis:\n\nRaw score = 64 - 0.95 *(PDW) - 0.69 *(ASL)\n\n### The Gunning Fog Formula[edit]\n\nMain article: Gunning fog index\n\nIn the 1940s, Robert Gunning helped bring readability research into the\nworkplace. In 1944, he founded the first readability consulting firm dedicated\nto reducing the \"fog\" in newspapers and business writing. In 1952, he\npublished The Technique of Clear Writing with his own Fog Index, a formula\nthat correlates 0.91 with comprehension as measured by reading tests.^[12] The\nformula is one of the most reliable and simplest to apply:\n\n    Grade level= 0.4 * ( (average sentence length) + (percentage of Hard Words) )\n\n    Where: Hard Words = words with more than two syllables.^[48]\n\n### Fry Readability Graph[edit]\n\nMain article: Fry readability formula\n\nIn 1963, while teaching English teachers in Uganda, Edward Fry developed his\nReadability Graph. It became one of the most popular formulas and easiest to\napply.^[49]^[50] The Fry Graph correlates 0.86 with comprehension as measured\nby reading tests.^[12]\n\n### McLaughlin's SMOG Formula[edit]\n\nMain article: SMOG\n\nHarry McLaughlin determined that word length and sentence length should be\nmultiplied rather than added as in other formulas. In 1969, he published his\nSMOG (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook) formula:\n\n    SMOG grading = 3 + \u221apolysyllable count.\n\n    Where: polysyllable count = number of words of more than two syllables in a sample of 30 sentences.^[51]\n\nThe SMOG formula correlates 0.88 with comprehension as measured by reading\ntests.^[12] It is often recommended for use in healthcare.^[52]\n\n### The FORCAST Formula[edit]\n\nIn 1973, a study commissioned by the US military of the reading skills\nrequired for different military jobs produced the FORCAST formula. Unlike most\nother formulas, it uses only a vocabulary element, making it useful for texts\nwithout complete sentences. The formula satisfied requirements that it would\nbe:\n\n  * Based on Army-job reading materials.\n  * Suitable for the young adult-male recruits.\n  * Easy enough for Army clerical personnel to use without special training or equipment.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n    Grade level = 20 \u2212 (N / 10)\n\n    Where N = number of single-syllable words in a 150-word sample.^[53]\n\nThe FORCAST formula correlates 0.66 with comprehension as measured by reading\ntests.^[12]\n\n### The Golub Syntactic Density Score[edit]\n\nThe Golub Syntactic Density Score was developed by Lester Golub in 1974. It is\namong a smaller subset of readability formulas that concentrate on the\nsyntactic features of a text. To calculate the reading level of a text, a\nsample of several hundred words is taken from the text. The number of words in\nthe sample is counted, as are the number of T-units. A T-unit is defined as an\nindependent clause and any dependent clauses attached to it. Other syntactical\nunits are then counted and entered into the following table:\n\n    \n    \n    1. Words/T-unit .95 X _________ ___ 2. Subordinate clauses/T-unit .90 X _________ ___ 3. Main clause word length (mean) .20 X _________ ___ 4. Subordinate clause length (mean) .50 X _________ ___ 5. Number of Modals (will, shall, can, may, must, would...) .65 X _________ ___ 6. Number of Be and Have forms in the auxiliary .40 X _________ ___ 7. Number of Prepositional Phrases .75 X _________ ___ 8. Number of Possessive nouns and pronouns .70 X _________ ___ 9. Number of Adverbs of Time (when, then, once, while...) .60 X _________ ___ 10. Number of gerunds, participles, and absolutes Phrases .85 X _________ ___\n\nUsers add the numbers in the right hand column and divide the total by the\nnumber of T-units. Finally, the quotient is entered into the following table\nto arrive at a final readability score.\n\nSDS| 0.5| 1.3| 2.1| 2.9| 3.7| 4.5| 5.3| 6.1| 6.9| 7.7| 8.5| 9.3| 10.1| 10.9  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nGrade| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9| 10| 11| 12| 13| 14  \n  \n### Measuring Coherence and Organization[edit]\n\nFor centuries, teachers and educators have seen the importance of\norganization, coherence, and emphasis in good writing. Beginning in the 1970s,\ncognitive theorists began teaching that reading is really an act of thinking\nand organization. The reader constructs meaning by mixing new knowledge into\nexisting knowledge. Because of the limits of the reading ease formulas, some\nresearch looked at ways to measure the content, organization, and coherence of\ntext. Although this did not improve the reliability of the formulas, their\nefforts showed the importance of these variables in reading ease.\n\nStudies by Walter Kintch and others showed the central role of coherence in\nreading ease, mainly for people learning to read.^[54] In 1983, Susan Kemper\ndevised a formula based on physical states and mental states. However, she\nfound this was no better than word familiarity and sentence length in showing\nreading ease.^[55]\n\nBonnie Meyer and others tried to use organization as a measure of reading\nease. While this did not result in a formula, they showed that people read\nfaster and retain more when the text is organized in topics. She found that a\nvisible plan for presenting content greatly helps readers to assess a text. A\nhierarchical plan shows how the parts of the text are related. It also aids\nthe reader in blending new information into existing knowledge\nstructures.^[56]\n\nBonnie Armbruster found that the most important feature for learning and\ncomprehension is textual coherence, which comes in two types:\n\n  * Global coherence, which integrates high-level ideas as themes in an entire section, chapter, or book.\n  * Local coherence, which joins ideas within and between sentences.\n\nArmbruster confirmed Kintsch's finding that coherence and structure are more\nhelp for younger readers.^[57] R. C. Calfee and R. Curley built on Bonnie\nMeyer's work and found that an unfamiliar underlying structure can make even\nsimple text hard to read. They brought in a graded system to help students\nprogress from simpler story lines to more advanced and abstract ones.^[58]\n\nMany other studies looked at the effects on reading ease of other text\nvariables, including:\n\n  * Image words, abstraction, direct and indirect statements, types of narration and sentences, phrases, and clauses;^[37]\n  * Difficult concepts;^[43]\n  * Idea density;^[59]\n  * Human interest;^[48]^[60]\n  * Nominalization;^[61]\n  * Active and passive voice;^[62]^[63]^[64]^[65]\n  * Embeddedness;^[63]\n  * Structural cues;^[66]^[67]\n  * The use of images;^[68]^[69]\n  * Diagrams and line graphs;^[70]\n  * Highlighting;^[71]\n  * Fonts and layout;^[72]\n  * Document age.^[73]\n\n## Advanced Readability Formulas[edit]\n\n### The John Bormuth Formulas[edit]\n\nJohn Bormuth of the University of Chicago looked at reading ease using the new\nCloze deletion test developed by Wilson Taylor. His work supported earlier\nresearch including the degree of reading ease for each kind of reading. The\nbest level for classroom \"assisted reading\" is a slightly difficult text that\ncauses a \"set to learn\", and for which readers can correctly answer 50% of the\nquestions of a multiple-choice test. The best level for unassisted reading is\none for which readers can correctly answer 80% of the questions. These cutoff\nscores were later confirmed by Vygotsky^[74] and Chall and Conard.^[75] Among\nother things, Bormuth confirmed that vocabulary and sentence length are the\nbest indicators of reading ease. He showed that the measures of reading ease\nworked as well for adults as for children. The same things that children find\nhard are the same for adults of the same reading levels. He also developed\nseveral new measures of cutoff scores. One of the most well known was the Mean\nCloze Formula, which was used in 1981 to produce the Degree of Reading Power\nsystem used by the College Entrance Examination Board.^[76]^[77]^[78]\n\n### The Lexile Framework[edit]\n\nIn 1988, Jack Stenner and his associates at MetaMetrics, Inc. published the\nLexile Framework for assessing readability and matching students with\nappropriate texts.\n\nThe Lexile framework uses average sentence length, and average word frequency\nin the American Heritage Intermediate Corpus to predict a score on a 0\u20132000\nscale. The AHI Corpus includes five million words from 1,045 published works\noften read by students in grades three to nine.^[citation needed]\n\n### ATOS Readability Formula for Books[edit]\n\nIn 2000, researchers of the School Renaissance Institute and Touchstone\nApplied Science Associates published their Advantage-TASA Open Standard (ATOS)\nReading ease Formula for Books. They worked on a formula that was easy to use\nand that could be used with any texts.\n\nThe project was one of the widest reading ease projects ever. The developers\nof the formula used 650 normed reading texts, 474 million words from all the\ntext in 28,000 books read by students. The project also used the reading\nrecords of more than 30,000 who read and were tested on 950,000 books.\n\nThey found that three variables give the most reliable measure of text reading\nease:\n\n  * words per sentence\n  * average grade level of words\n  * characters per word\n\nThey also found that:\n\n  * To help learning, the teacher should match book reading ease with reading skill.\n  * Reading often helps with reading gains.\n  * For reading alone below the 4th grade, the best learning gain requires at least 85% comprehension.\n  * Advanced readers need 92% comprehension for independent reading.\n  * Book length can be a good measure of reading ease.\n  * Feedback and interaction with the teacher are the most important factors in reading.^[79]^[80]\n\n### CohMetrix Psycholinguistics Measurements[edit]\n\nCoh-Metrix can be used in many different ways to investigate the cohesion of\nthe explicit text and the coherence of the mental representation of the text.\n\"Our definition of cohesion consists of characteristics of the explicit text\nthat play some role in helping the reader mentally connect ideas in the\ntext.\"^[81] The definition of coherence is the subject of much debate.\nTheoretically, the coherence of a text is defined by the interaction between\nlinguistic representations and knowledge representations. While coherence can\nbe defined as characteristics of the text (i.e., aspects of cohesion) that are\nlikely to contribute to the coherence of the mental representation, Coh-Metrix\nmeasurements provide indices of these cohesion characteristics.^[81]\n\n## Other Formulas[edit]\n\n  * Automated readability index (1967)\n  * Linsear Write Raygor readability estimate (1977)\n  * Spache readability formula (1952)\n\n## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Approach[edit]\n\nUnlike the traditional readability formulas, artificial intelligence\napproaches to readability assessment (also known as Automatic Readability\nAssessment) incorporate myriad linguistic features and construct statistical\nprediction models to predict text readability.^[82]^[83] These approaches\ntypically consist of three steps: 1. a training corpus of individual texts, 2.\na set of linguistic features to be computed from each text, and 3. a machine\nlearning model to predict the readability, using the computed linguistic\nfeature values.^[84]^[85]^[83]\n\n### Corpora[edit]\n\n#### WeeBit[edit]\n\nIn 2012, Sowmya Vajjala at the University of T\u00fcbingen created the WeeBit\ncorpus by combining educational articles from the Weekly Reader website and\nBBC Bitesize website, which provide texts for different age groups.^[85] In\ntotal, there are 3125 articles that are divided into five readability levels\n(from age 7 to 16). Weebit corpus has been used in several AI-based\nreadability assessment research.^[86]\n\n#### Newsela[edit]\n\nWei Xu (University of Pennsylvania), Chris Callison-Burch (University of\nPennsylvania), and Courtney Napoles (Johns Hopkins University) introduced the\nNewsela corpus to the academic field in 2015.^[87] The corpus is a collection\nof thousands of news articles professionally leveled to different reading\ncomplexities by professional editors at Newsela. The corpus was originally\nintroduced for text simplification research, but was also used for text\nreadability assessment.^[88]\n\n### Linguistic Features[edit]\n\n#### Semantic or Advanced Semantic[edit]\n\nAdvanced semantic or semantic features' influence on text readability was\npioneered by Bruce W. Lee during his study at the (University of\nPennsylvania), in 2021. Whilst introducing his features hybridization method,\nhe also explored handcrafted advanced semantic features which aim to measure\nthe amount of knowledge contained in a given text.^[89]\n\n  * Semantic Richness :\n  * Semantic Clarity :\n  * Semantic Noise :\n\nwhere the count of discovered topics (n) and topic probability (p)\n\n#### Lexico-Semantic[edit]\n\nThe type-token ratio is one of the features that are often used to captures\nthe lexical richness, which is a measure of vocabulary range and diversity. To\nmeasure the lexical difficulty of a word, the relative frequency of the word\nin a representative corpus like the Corpus of Contemporary American English\n(COCA) is often used. Below includes some examples for lexico-semantic\nfeatures in readability assessment.^[86]\n\n  * Average number of syllables per word\n  * Out-of-vocabulary rate, in comparison to the full corpus\n  * Type-token ratio: the ratio of unique terms to total terms observed\n  * Ratio of function words, in comparison to the full corpus\n  * Ratio of pronouns, in comparison to the full corpus\n  * Language model perplexity (comparing the text to generic or genre-specific models)\n\nIn addition, Lijun Feng pioneered the cognitively-motivated features (mostly\nlexical) in 2009. This was during her doctorate study at the City University\nof New York (CUNY).^[90] The cognitively-motivated features were originally\ndesigned for adults with intellectual disability, but was proved to improve\nreadability assessment accuracy in general. Cognitively-motivated features, in\ncombination with a logistic regression model, can correct the average error of\nFlesch\u2013Kincaid grade-level by more than 70%. The newly discovered features by\nFeng include:\n\n  * Number of lexical chains in document\n  * Average number of unique entities per sentence\n  * Average number of entity mentions per sentence\n  * Total number of unique entities in document\n  * Total number of entity mentions in document\n  * Average lexical chain length\n  * Average lexical chain span\n\n#### Syntactic[edit]\n\nSyntactic complexity is correlated with longer processing times in text\ncomprehension.^[91] It is common to use a rich set of these syntactic features\nto predict the readability of a text. The more advanced variants of syntactic\nreadability features are frequently computed from parse tree. Emily Pitler\n(University of Pennsylvania) and Ani Nenkova (University of Pennsylvania) are\nconsidered pioneers in evaluating the parse-tree syntactic features and making\nit widely used in readability assessment.^[92]^[86] Some examples include:\n\n  * Average sentence length\n  * Average parse tree height\n  * Average number of noun phrases per sentence\n  * Average number of verb phrases per sentence\n\n## Using the Readability Formulas[edit]\n\nThe accuracy of readability formulas increases when finding the average\nreadability of a large number of works. The tests generate a score based on\ncharacteristics such as statistical average word length (which is used as an\nunreliable proxy for semantic difficulty; sometimes word frequency is taken\ninto account) and sentence length (as an unreliable proxy for syntactic\ncomplexity) of the work.\n\nMost experts agree that simple readability formulas like Flesch\u2013Kincaid grade-\nlevel can be highly misleading.^[93] Even though the traditional features like\nthe average sentence length have high correlation with reading difficulty, the\nmeasure of readability is much more complex. The artificial intelligence,\ndata-driven approach (see above) was studied to tackle this shortcoming.^[94]\n\nWriting experts have warned that an attempt to simplify the text only by\nchanging the length of the words and sentences may result in text that is more\ndifficult to read.^[95] All the variables are tightly related. If one is\nchanged, the others must also be adjusted, including approach, voice, person,\ntone, typography, design, and organization.\n\nWriting for a class of readers other than one's own is very difficult. It\ntakes training, method, and practice.^[96] Among those who are good at this\nare writers of novels and children's books. The writing experts all advise\nthat, besides using a formula, observe all the norms of good writing, which\nare essential for writing readable texts. Writers should study the texts used\nby their audience and their reading habits.^[97] This means that for a 5th-\ngrade audience, the writer should study and learn good quality 5th-grade\nmaterials.^[98]^[99]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Asemic writing\n  * Plain language\n  * Verbosity\n  * Accessible publishing\n  * George R.
