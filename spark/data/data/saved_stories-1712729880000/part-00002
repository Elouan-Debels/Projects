Yet the beat goes on. With Scott\nAlexander at long last giving us what I expect to be effectively the semi-\nfinal words on the Rootclaim debate, it seemed time to do this again.\n\n####\n\nBad News\n\nI know no methodical way to find a good, let alone great, therapist.\n\n> Cate Hall: One reason it\u2019s so hard to find a good therapist is that all the\n> elite ones market themselves as coaches.\n\nAs a commentor points out, therapists who can\u2019t make it also market as coaches\nor similar, so even if Cate\u2019s claim is true then it is tough.\n\nMy actual impression is that the elite therapists largely do not market\nthemselves at all. They instead work on referrals and reputation. So you have\nto know someone who knows. They used to market, then they filled up and did\nnot have to, so they stopped. Even if they do some marketing, seeing the\nmarketing copy won\u2019t easily differentiate them from other therapists. There\nare many reasons why our usual internet approach of reviews is mostly useless\nhere. Even with AI, I am guessing we currently lack enough data to give you\ngood recommendations from feedback alone.\n\n####\n\nGood News, Everyone\n\nAmerican life expectancy rising again, was 77.5 years (+1.1) in 2022.\n\nBryan Johnson, whose slogan is \u2018Don\u2019t Die,\u2019 continues his quest for eternal\nyouth, seen here trying to restore his joints. Mike Solana interviews Bryan\nJohnson about his efforts here more generally. The plan is to not die via two\nhours of being studied every day, what he finds is ideal diet, exercise and\nsleep, and other techniques and therapies including bursts of light and a few\nsupplements.\n\nI wish this man the best of luck. I hope he finds the answers and does not\ndie, and that this helps the rest of us also not die.\n\nAlas, I am not expecting much. His concept of \u2018rate of aging\u2019 does not strike\nme as how any of this is likely to work, nor does addressing joint health seem\nlikely to much extend life or generalize. His techniques do not target any of\nthe terminal aging issues. A lot of it seems clearly aimed at being healthy\nnow, feeling and looking younger now. Which is great, but I do not expect it\nto buy much in the longer term.\n\nAlso one must note that the accusations in the responses to the above-linked\nthread about his personal actions are not great. But I would not let that\nsully his efforts to not die or help others not die.\n\nI can\u2019t help but notice the parallel to AI safety. I see Johnson as doing lots\nof mundane health work, to make himself healthier now. Which is great,\nalthough if that\u2019s all it is then the full routine is obviously a bit much.\nMost people should do more of such things. The problem is that Johnson is\nexpecting this to translate into defeating aging, which I very much do not\nexpect.\n\nGene therapy cures first case of congenital deafness. Woo-hoo! Imagine what\nelse we could do with gene therapies if we were \u2018ethically\u2019 allowed to do so.\nIt is a sign of the times that I expected much reaction to this to be hostile\nboth on the \u2018how dare you mess with genetics\u2019 front and also the \u2018how dare you\nmake someone not deaf\u2019 front.\n\n####\n\nThe Battle of the Bulge\n\nA \u2018vaccine-like\u2019 version of Wegovy is on the drawing board at Novo Nordisk\n(Stat+). If you are convinced you need this permanently it would be a lot\ncheaper and easier in this form, but this is the kind of thing you want to be\nable to reverse, especially as technology improves. Consider as parallel, an\nIUD is great technology but would be much worse if you could not later remove\nit.\n\nThe battle can be won, also Tracy Morgan really was playing Tracy Morgan when\nhe played Tracy Morgan.\n\n> Page Six: Tracy Morgan says he \u2018gained 40 pounds\u2019 on weight-loss drugs: I\n> can \u2018out-eat Ozempic\u2019\n>\n> \u201cIt cuts my appetite in half,\u201d the 55-year-old told Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush\n> Hager on the \u201cToday\u201d show in August 2023.\n\nWe used to eat a lot more, including more starch and sugar, without becoming\nobese, including people who did limited physical activity. According to these\nstatistics, quite a lot more. Yes, we eat some new unhealthy things, but when\npeople cut those things out without cutting calories, they do not typically\nlose dramatic amounts of weight.\n\nAll right, why do the studies find ice cream is good for you, again? As a\nreminder the Atlantic dug into this a year ago, and now Manifold gives us some\noptions, will resolve by subjective weighing of factors.\n\nMy money continues to be on substitution effects, with a side of several of\nthe other things. Ice cream lets you buy joy, and buy having had dessert, at\nvery little cost in calories, nutrition or health. No, it\u2019s not great for you,\nbut it\u2019s not in the same category as other desserts like cake or cookies, and\nit substitutes for them while reducing caloric intake.\n\nI am not about to short a 13% for five years, but I very much expect this\nresult to continue to replicate. And I do think that this is one of the easier\nways to improve your diet, to substitute ice cream for other desserts.\n\nThe NIH is spending $189 million dollars to do a detailed 10,000 person study\nto figure out what you should eat.\n\n> Andrea Peterson (WSJ): Scientists agree broadly on what constitutes a\n> healthy diet\u2014heavy on veggies, fruit, whole grains and lean protein\u2014but more\n> research is showing that different people respond differently to the same\n> foods, such as bread or bananas.\n\nI would instead claim we have broad agreement as to what things we socially\nlabel as \u2018healthy\u2019 versus \u2018unhealthy,\u2019 with little if any actual understanding\nof what is actually healthy or unhealthy, and the broad expectation among the\nwise that the answers vary greatly between individuals.\n\n> Elizabeth and his fellow participants spend two weeks each on three\n> different diets. One is high fat and low carb; another is low on added\n> sugars and heavy on vegetables, along with fruit, fish, poultry, eggs and\n> dairy; a third is high in ultra-processed foods and added sugars.\n\nThis at best lets us compare those three options to each other under highly\nunnatural conditions, where the scientists apply great pressure to ensure\neveryone eats exactly the right things, and that have to severely alter\npeople\u2019s physical activity levels. A lot of why some diets succeed and others\nfail is how people actually act in practice, including impact on exercise.\nKnowing what set of foods in exactly what quantities and consumption patterns\nwould be good if someone theoretically ate exactly that way is nice, but of\nnot so much practical value.\n\nAlso, they are going to put each person on each diet for only two weeks? What\nis even the point? Yes, they draw blood a lot, measure heart rates, take other\nmeasures. Those are highly noisy metrics at best, that tell us little about\nlong term impacts.\n\nThis does not seem like $189 million well spent. I cannot imagine a result\nthat would cause me to change my consumption or much update my beliefs, in any\ndirection.\n\nThis both is and is not how all of this works:\n\n> Keto Carnivore: [losing weight] not hard compared to being fat, in pain,\n> chronically fatigued, or anxious/depressed/psychotic. Those things are\n> extremely motivating. It's only hard if it doesn't work, or the body is\n> fighting it (like caloric restriction without satiation, or constant\n> cravings).\n>\n> exfatloss: Can\ud83d\udcafconfirm. Do you know how much willpower I need to do a pretty\n> strict ketogenic diet?\n>\n> 0\\. Because the alternative is not having a career/life and feeling like\n> shit all the time from sleep deprivation.\n>\n> When it obviously works, motivation is not an issue.\n>\n> To clarify, I have a very rare and specific circadian rhythm disorder that\n> therapeutic keto fixes. 99.99% of people don't have this issue and therefore\n> won't get the same benefits I do.\n\nMotivation is not an issue for me, in the sense that I have no doubt that I\nwill continue to do what it takes to keep the weight off.\n\nThat does not mean it is easy. It is not easy. It is hard. Not every day. Not\nevery hour. But often, yes, it is hard, the road is long. But yeah, the\nalternative is so obviously worse that I know I will do whatever it takes, if\nit looks like I might slip.\n\n####\n\nSupport Anti-Aging Research\n\n'\u2018What we wish we knew entering the aging field.\u2019 I hear optimistic things\nthat we will start to see the first real progress soon, but it is not clear\npeople wouldn\u2019t say those things anyway. It certainly seems plausible we could\nstart making rapid progress soon. Aging is a disease. Cure it.\n\n####\n\nVariably Effective Altruism\n\nKen Griffin donates $400 million to cancer hospital Sloan Kettering. Not the\nmost effective altruism available, but still, what a mensch.\n\n####\n\nPeriodic Reminders (You Should Know This Already)\n\nSulfur dioxide in particular is a huge deal. The estimate here is that a 1 ppb\ndrop in levels, a 10% decline in pollution, would increase life expectancy by\na whopping 1.2 years. Huge if even partially true, I have not looked into the\nscience.\n\nSomeone should buy 23AndMe purely to safeguard its data. Cost is already down\nto roughly $20 per person\u2019s data.\n\nYes, Schizophrenia is mostly genetic.\n\nHIPPA in practice is a really dumb law, a relic of a time when digital\ncommunications did not exist. The benefits of being able to email and text\ndoctors vastly exceed the costs, and obviously so. Other places like the UK\ndon\u2019t have it and it\u2019s much better.\n\nThe story of PEPFAR, and how it turned out to be dramatically effective to do\nHIV treatment instead of HIV prevention, against the advice of economists.\nBack then there were no EAs, but the economists were making remarkably EA-like\narguments, while making classic errors like citing studies showing very low\ncost estimates per life saved for prevention that failed to replicate,\nincluding ignoring existing failed replications. And they failed to understand\nthat the moral case for treatment allowed expansion of the budget and also\nthat treatment halted transmission, and thus was also prevention.\n\nIn many senses, it is clear that Bush \u2018got lucky\u2019 here, with the transmission\neffect and adherence rates exceeding any reasonable expectations, while\nprevention via traditional methods seems to have proven even less effective\nthan we might have expected. If I had to take away three key lessons, they\nwould be that you need to do larger scale empiricism to see what works and not\ncount on small studies, and that you should care a lot about making the moral\nor obvious case for what you are doing, because budgets for good causes are\nnever fixed. People adjust them based on how excited they are to participate.\nAnd I do not think this is stupid behavior on anyone\u2019s part, focusing on\nthings where you score clear visible wins guards against a lot of failure\nmodes, even at potential large efficiency costs, while usually still being\nmore than efficient enough to be worth doing on its own merits.\n\n####\n\nFDA Delenda Est\n\nSay it with me, the phrase is catching on, except looks like this was\neventually approved anyway?\n\n> Henry: TIL there was a company that sold a baby sock with an spo2 monitor\n> that sent a push notification if your baby stopped breathing until the FDA\n> forced them to stop selling them because only doctors should be able to see\n> a blood oxygen number.\n>\n> > The FDA objection was based on the fact that the wearable had the capacity\n> to relay a live display of a baby\u2019s heart rate and oxygen levels, which is\n> critical data that a doctor should interpret, especially in vulnerable\n> populations.\n>\n> FDA delenda est.\n\nIf I try, yes, I can tell a story where people think \u2018oh I do not have to\ncheck on my baby anymore because if something goes wrong the sock will tell\nme\u2019 and this ends up being a bad thing. You can also tell that story about\nalmost anything else.\n\n####\n\nOther Enemies of Life\n\nSome very silly people argue that it is not preventing schizophrenia unless\nyou do so in a particular individual, if you do it via polygenic selection\nthen it is \u2018replacement.\u2019 Scott Alexander does his standard way overthinking\nit via excruciating detail method of showing why this is rather dumb.\n\n90% of junior doctors in South Korea strike to protest against doctors.\nSpecially, against admitting 2,000 more students each year to medical schools.\nOne can say \u2018in-group loyalty\u2019 or \u2018enlightened self-interest\u2019 if one wants. Or\nrealize this is straight up mafia or cartel behavior, and make it 5,000.\n\n> Brian Patrick Moore: Good thing we don't have some crazy thing like this in\n> the US\n\nOf all the low hanging fruits in health care, \u2018lots of capable people want to\nbe doctors and we should train more of them to be doctors\u2019 has to be the\nlowest hanging of all.\n\n####\n\nCovid Postmortems\n\nVaccine mandates for health care workers worsened worker shortages on net, the\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to get vaccinated or told what to do\u2019 effect was bigger than the\n\u2018I am safer now\u2019 effect, claiming a 6% decline in healthcare employment.\nMarginal Revolution summarized this as the mandate backfiring. We do see that\na cost was paid here. It is not obvious the cost is not worthwhile, and also\nif someone in healthcare would quit rather than be vaccinated one questions\nwhether you wanted them working that job.\n\nKatelyn Jetelina asks Kelley Krohnert why science lost public trust during the\npandemic. The default is still \u2018a fair amount\u2019 of trust but the decline is\nclear especially among Republicans.\n\nHere are the core answers given:\n\n> #### Everything sounds like a sales pitch\n>\n> From Paxlovid to vaccines to masks to ventilation. Public health sounded\n> (and still sounds like) a used car salesman for many different reasons:\n>\n>   1. Data seems crafted to feed the pitch rather than the pitch crafted by\n> data. Overly optimistic claims weren\u2019t well-supported by data, risks of\n> Covid were communicated uniformly which meant the risks to young people were\n> exaggerated, and potential vaccine harms were dismissed. Later, when it was\n> time to pitch boosters, public health pivoted on a dime to tell us vaccine\n> protection wanes quickly. How did we get here?\n>\n>   2. Data mistakes ...\n>\n>   3. Messaging inaccuracies. ...\n>\n>   4. Mixing advocacy with scientific communication ... The latest example\n> was a long Covid discussion at a recent congressional hearing, and one of\n> the top long Covid doctors saying, \u201cThe burden of disease from long Covid is\n> on par with the burden of cancer and heart disease.\u201d\n>\n>\n\nI would give people more credit. Focusing on what things \u2018sound like\u2019 was a\nlot of what got us into this mess.\n\nThe issue wasn\u2019t that everything \u2018sounded\u2019 like a sales pitch.\n\nThe problem was that everything was a sales pitch.\n\nPeople are not scientific experts, but they can recognize a sales pitch.\n\nThe polite way to describe what happened was \u2018scientists and doctors from\nFauci on down decided to primarily operate as Simulacra Level 2 operators who\nsaid what they thought would cause the behaviors they wanted. They did not\ncare whether their statements matched the truth of the physical world, except\ninsofar as this would cause people to react badly.\n\nAs for this last item, I mean, there is a lot of selection bias in who becomes\na \u2018top long Covid doctor\u2019 so it is no surprise that he was up there testifying\n(in a mask in 2024) that long Covid is on par with the burden of cancer and\nheart disease, a comment that makes absolutely zero sense.\n\nIndeed, statements like that are not \u2018mixing advocacy with scientific\ncommunication.\u2019 My term for them is Obvious Nonsense, and the impolite word\nwould be \u2018lying.\u2019\n\n> #### Information that would have been helpful was never provided\n\nIndeed, \u2018ethicists\u2019 and other experts worked hard to ensure that we never\nfound out much key information, and that we failed to communicate other highly\nuseful informat we did know or damn well have enough to take a guess about, in\nways that ordinary people found infuriating and could not help but notice was\nintentional.\n\nThis has been going on forever in medicine, better to tell you nothing than\ninformation \u2018experts\u2019 worry you won\u2019t interpret or react to \u2018properly,\u2019 and\nbetter not to gather information if there is a local ethical concern no matter\nthe cost of ignorance, such as months (or in other cases years) without a\nvaccine.\n\n> #### A disconnect between what I experienced on the ground and the narrative\n> I was hearing\n\nAs in, Covid-19 in most cases wasn\u2019t that scary in practice, and people\nnoticed. I do think this one was difficult to handle. You have something that\nis 95%-99% to be essentially fine (depending on your threshold for fine) but\nwill sometimes kill you. People\u2019s heuristics are not equipped to handle it.\n\nShe concludes that some things are improving. But it is too little, too late.\nDamage is mostly done, and no one is paying attention anymore, and also they\nare still pushing more boosters. But this is at least the start of a real\nreckoning.\n\nAs an example of this all continuing: I have been told that The New York Times\nfact checks its editorials, and when I wrote an editorial I felt fact checked,\nbut clearly it does not insist on those checks in any meaningful sense, since\nthey published an op-ed claiming the Covid vaccine saved 3 million lives in\nAmerica in its first two years. That makes zero sense. America has only 331.9\nmillion people, and the IFR for Covid-19 on first infection is well under 1%\neven for the unvaccinated. The vaccines were amazing and saved a lot of lives.\nMaking grandiose false claims does not help convince people of that.\n\nMatt Yglesias has thoughts about Covid four years after.\n\nHe is still presenting More Lockdowns as something that would have been wise?\n\n> If the Australian right could implement hard lockdowns to control the virus,\n> I believe the American right could have as well. This probably would have\n> saved a ton of lives. Australia and other countries with tougher lockdown\n> policies saw dramatically lower mortality.\n\nOr maybe not?\n\n> Even a really successful lockdown regime couldn\u2019t be sustained forever, and\n> there was a price to pay in Australia and Finland and everywhere else once\n> you opened up.\n\nI mean, yes those other countries had lower mortality, but did America have\nthe prerequisites to make such policies sustainable, where they work well\nenough you can loosen them and they still work and so on? I think very clearly\nno. Trying to lock down harder here would have been a deeply bad idea, because\nfor better and also for worse we lacked the state and civilizational capacity\nto pull it off.\n\nThen we have these two points, which seem directly contradictory? I think the\nsecond one is right and the first is wrong. The hypocrisy was a really huge\ndeal.\n\n> I think the specific hypocrisy of some progressive public health figures\n> endorsing the Floyd protests is somewhat overblown.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> After Floyd, it became completely inconceivable that any liberal\n> jurisdiction in America would actually enforce any kind of tough Covid\n> rules.\n\nHe makes this good note.\n\n> Speaking of drift, I think an under-discussed aspect of the Biden\n> administration is they initiated a bunch of rules right when they took\n> office and vaccine distribution was just starting and had no plan to phase\n> them out, seemingly ever. When they got sued over the airplane mask mandate,\n> they fought in court to maintain it.\n\nAt minimum this was a missed opportunity to show reasonableness and\ncompetence. At worst, this was a true-colors moment for many people, who\nremember even if they don\u2019t realize they remember.\n\nMatt also points out that there has been no reckoning for our failures.\nAmerica utterly failed to make tests available in reasonable fashion. Everyone\nagrees on this, and no one is trying to address the reasons that happened. The\nwhole series of disingenuous mask policies and communications also has had no\nreckoning. And while Democrats had an advantage on Covid in 2020, their later\npolicies did not make sense, pissed people off and destroyed that advantage.\n\n####\n\nCovid-19 Origins\n\nScott Alexander posted an extensive transcript and thoughts on the Rootclaim\ndebate over Covid origins. The natural origin side won decisively, and Scott\nwas convinced. That does not mean there are not ongoing attempts to challenge\nthe result, such as these. An hours-long detailed debate is so much better\nthan not having one, but the result is still highly correlated with the skills\nand knowledge and strategies of the two debaters, so in a sense it is only one\ndata point unless you actually go over the arguments and facts and check\neverything. Which I am not going to be doing.\n\n(I mean, I could of course be hired to do so, but I advise you strongly not to\ndo that.)\n\nTo illustrate how bad an idea that would be, Scott Alexander offers us the\nhighlights from the comments and deals with various additional arguments. It\nends with, essentially, Rootclaim saying that Scott Alexander did not invest\nenough time in the process and does not know how to do probability theory, and\noh this would all be sorted out otherwise. Whether or not they are right, that\nis about as big a \u2018there be dragons and also tsuris\u2019 sign as I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nThe one note I will make, but hold weakly, is that it seems like people could\ndo a much better job of accounting for correlated errors, model uncertainty or\nmeta uncertainty in their probability calculations.\n\nAs in, rather than pick one odds ratio for the location of the outbreak being\nat the wet market, one should have a distribution over possible correct odds\nratios, and then see how much those correlate with correct odds ratios in\nother places. Not only am I not sure what to make of this one rather central\npiece of offered evidence, who is right about the right way to treat that\nclaim would move me a lot on who is right about the right way to treat a lot\nof other claims, as well. The practical takeaway is that, without any desire\nto wade into the question of who is right about any particular details or\noverall, it seems like everyone (even when not trolling) is acting too\nconfident based on what they think about the component arguments, including\nScott\u2019s 90% zoonosis.\n\nMy actual core thinking is still that either zoonosis or a lab leak could\ncounterfactually have quite easily caused a pandemic that looks like Covid-19,\nour current ongoing practices at labs like Wuhan put as at substantial risk\nfor lab leaks that cause pandemics that could easily be far worse than\nCovid-19.\n\nI do not see any good arguments that a lab leak or zoonosis couldn\u2019t both\ncause similar pandemics, everyone is merely arguing over which caused the\nCovid-19 pandemic in particular. And I claim that this fact is much more\nimportant than whether Covid-19 in particular was a lab leak.\n\n####\n\nAssisted Suicide Watch\n\n\u2018I\u2019m 28.

I am ready to go ahead and say that, if we have to\nchoose one extreme or the other, I choose \u2018this is not allowed.\u2019\n\nIdeally I would not go with the extreme. I would instead choose a relatively\nlight \u2018this is not allowed\u2019 where in practice we mostly look the other way.\nBut assisting you would still be taking on real legal risk if others decided\nyou did something wrong, and that risk would increase if you were sufficiently\nbrazen that your actions weakened the norms against suicide or you were seen\nas in any way applying pressure.\n\nHowever, I worry that if the norms are insufficiently strong, they fail to be\nan equilibrium, and we end up with de facto suicide booths and medical\nprofessionals suggesting euthanasia to free up their budgets and relatives\ntrying to get you out of the way or who want their inheritance early, a lot of\n\u2018oh then kill yourself\u2019 as if that is a reasonable thing to do, and life being\ncheap.\n\n####\n\nTalking Price\n\nNew world\u2019s most expensive drug costs $4.25 million dollars.

The 58% of children who live to age 6 are not\ngoing to get anything like full quality of life, with declining function over\ntime.\n\nSo yes, assuming this is a full cure then this does seem worth it for America,\non the principle that a life saved is worth about $10 million. In theory we\nshould be willing to pay at least $5 million for this drug, possibly up to $10\nmillion, before it would cost more than it is worth.\n\nThus, one could say this is priced roughly correctly. Why shouldn\u2019t a\nmonopolist be charing roughly half of consumer surplus, especially if we want\nto incentivize creating more such products? Seems like about the right reward.\n\n(Obviously, one could say EA-style things about how that money might be better\nspent. I am confident telling those people they are thinking on the wrong\nmargin.)\n\n### Subscribe to Don't Worry About the Vase\n\nBy Zvi Mowshowitz \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nA world made of gears.
