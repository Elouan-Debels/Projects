Download the source code and extract it to some folder.\n  2. Copy in the sqlite3.c, sqlite3.h and sqlite3ext.h files to the same folder (get them from https://sqlite.org/download.html).\n  3. Open terminal/command prompt and change to the directory where you have the source code files.\n  4. Compile using the platform-specific command below:\n\nWindows:gcc -g -shared sqlite-ndvss.c -o ndvss.dll.\n\nLinux:gcc -g -fPIC -shared sqlite-ndvss.c -o ndvss.so\n\nMac:gcc -g -fPIC -dynamiclib sqlite-ndvss.c -o ndvss.dylib\n\n## Loading the extension\n\nOpen a database and load the extension by running .load ./ndvss. Change the\npath if needed to match where you've saved the extension files, or copy the\ndll/so/dylib to a directory that is included in your system path variables.\nOnce loaded, you can use the ndvss-functions in your SQL code.\n\n## Functions\n\nFunction| Parameters| Return values| Description  \n---|---|---|---  \nndvss_version| none| Version number (DOUBLE)| Returns the version number of\nthe extension.  \nndvss_convert_str_to_array_f| Array to convert (TEXT), Number of dimensions\n(INT)| float-array (BLOB)| Converts the given text string containing an array\nof decimal numbers to a BLOB containing an array of floats. The textual array\ncan be a JSON formatted array or just a space-delimited or comma-delimeted\nlist of decimal numbers.  \nndvss_convert_str_to_array_d| Array to convert (TEXT), Number of dimensions\n(INT)| double-array (BLOB)| Converts the given text string containing an array\nof decimal numbers to a BLOB containing an array of doubles. The textual array\ncan be a JSON formatted array or just a space-delimited or comma-delimeted\nlist of decimal numbers.  \nndvss_cosine_similarity_f| Vector to search for (BLOB), Vector to compare to\n(BLOB), Number of dimensions (INT)| Similarity score (DOUBLE)| Calculates the\ncosine similarity between the vectors of floats given as arguments. The\nvectors need to be of the same data type (float) and contain the same number\nof dimensions.  \nndvss_cosine_similarity_d| Vector to search for (BLOB), Vector to compare to\n(BLOB), Number of dimensions (INT)| Similarity score (DOUBLE)| Calculates the\ncosine similarity between the vectors of doubles given as arguments. The\nvectors need to be of the same data type (double) and contain the same number\nof dimensions.  \nndvss_euclidean_distance_similarity_f| Vector to search for (BLOB), Vector to\ncompare to (BLOB), Number of dimensions (INT)| Similarity score (DOUBLE)|\nCalculates the euclidean distance similarity between the vectors of floats\ngiven as arguments. The vectors need to be of the same data type (float) and\ncontain the same number of dimensions.  \nndvss_euclidean_distance_similarity_d| Vector to search for (BLOB), Vector to\ncompare to (BLOB), Number of dimensions (INT)| Similarity score (DOUBLE)|\nCalculates the euclidean distance similarity between the vectors of doubles\ngiven as arguments. The vectors need to be of the same data type (double) and\ncontain the same number of dimensions.  \nndvss_euclidean_distance_squared_similarity_f| Vector to search for (BLOB),\nVector to compare to (BLOB), Number of dimensions (INT)| Similarity score\n(DOUBLE)| Does the same as ndvss_euclidean_distance_similarity_f but returns\nthe squared distance (i.e. doesn't calculate the square root).  \nndvss_euclidean_distance_squared_similarity_d| Vector to search for (BLOB),\nVector to compare to (BLOB), Number of dimensions (INT)| Similarity score\n(DOUBLE)| Does the same as ndvss_euclidean_distance_similarity_d but returns\nthe squared distance (i.e. doesn't calculate the square root).  \nndvss_dot_product_similarity_f| Vector to search for (BLOB), Vector to compare\nto (BLOB), Number of dimensions (INT)| Similarity score (DOUBLE)| Calculates\nthe dot product similarity between the vectors of floats given as arguments.\nThe vectors need to be of the same data type (float) and contain the same\nnumber of dimensions.  \nndvss_dot_product_similarity_d| Vector to search for (BLOB), Vector to compare\nto (BLOB), Number of dimensions (INT)| Similarity score (DOUBLE)| Calculates\nthe dot product similarity between the vectors of doubles given as arguments.\nThe vectors need to be of the same data type (double) and contain the same\nnumber of dimensions.  \nndvss_dot_product_similarity_str| Vector to search for (TEXT), Vector to\ncompare to (TEXT), Number of dimensions (INT)| Similarity score (DOUBLE)|\nCalculates the dot product similarity between the strings containing arrays of\ndecimal numbers given as arguments. The vectors need to be of the same data\ntype (double) and contain the same number of dimensions. The first argument is\ncached and is expected to be the array that is being searched.  \n  \n## If you find a bug\n\nPlease report it with steps on how to reproduce the issue.
