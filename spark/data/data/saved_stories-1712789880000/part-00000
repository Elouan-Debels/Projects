The app\nreached 100 million monthly active users in just two months \u2014 a new record.\nSince then, every software business, big or small, has defined its AI\nStrategy. Countless tweets have been written about the most awesome prompts.\nAnd doomers have predicted the end of the world thanks to AGI.\n\nBut let's assume it doesn't result in an apocalypse. Today's LLMs are\nimpressive in their capabilities. There's a vast amount of different models,\neach unique in its own way. As of today, Raycast AI combines a dozen of those\nmodels in a single interface, making them easily accessible anywhere on your\nMac. This blog post describes what\u2019s the fuzz about these models, when to use\neach one, and what to expect next from us.\n\n## Why support different models?\n\nLet\u2019s first take a step back. Why support multiple models in the first place?\nAt the end of last year, we actually decided to stick only with OpenAI models.\nWhen GPT-4 Turbo came out, it had everything: speed, intelligence, a long\ncontext window, and even supports vision, a.k.a. sending images, not just\ntext.\n\nFast forward to today, the world is different. New models are released almost\nevery week, each with unique benefits. Whenever we are uncertain about a\ndecision, we turn to our community, and it was the same this time. We asked\nand received a clear answer: Give us more models! So we got to work and looked\nat which models make actual sense for us to support.\n\n## The good, the bad, the ugly\n\nThere are broadly three categories to look at when comparing models: Speed,\nintelligence, and context window. Let\u2019s talk about them one by one, because as\nalways, the devil is in the details:\n\n  * Speed: The faster, the better, right? The problem is that the more intelligent a model is, the more parameters it has, and the more resources it needs to run at scale. So, you can't really look at speed in isolation.\n  * Intelligence: Well, first of all, those models aren't really intelligent. Neither can they reason about your coding problems or have general knowledge. All they do is predict the next word, but you probably know this by now. Nevertheless, some models are more capable. These models are usually trained on a larger dataset and therefore have better capabilities.\n  * Context Window: This is a weird one. The way those models work is by always looking at all the input text to generate content. This means that the longer the input, the more the model needs to take into consideration. There are now models that can read hundreds of pages, but this often leads to slower response times.\n\nAs you can see, we are going in circles, and things depend on each other. So,\nit's not really about there being one perfect model, but more of an \"it\ndepends.\u201d\n\n## One interface, many models\n\nWhile looking at various models, we tried to figure out what the \"superpower\"\nof each was. This helped us decide which models are worth adding besides\nOpenAI\u2019s. We also wanted to ensure that users have an easy way of selecting\nthe right model for their use case. Therefore, we redesigned our model picker\nto display more details, enabling them to choose the appropriate model for the\ntask at hand.\n\n### Perplexity - Where knowledge meets productivity\n\nOur community has long desired access to Perplexity in Raycast. Adding it was\na natural choice, and we collaborated with the Perplexity team to bring their\nonline Sonar models to Raycast. These models are designed for question-answer\nscenarios and are enriched with current internet knowledge, making them ideal\nfor Quick AI. Now, you can simply ask a question and receive an answer powered\nby Perplexity.\n\nTo celebrate this partnership, we're offering free trials of Perplexity Pro to\nall new annual Raycast Pro subscribers. New annual Pro subscribers receive 3\nmonths of Perplexity Pro at no additional cost. Additionally, subscribers to\nour paid add-on that unlocks the most powerful models get 6 months of\nPerplexity Pro.\n\nAccess to knowledge should be available to everyone. With Perplexity\nintegrated into Raycast, you can access it anytime, anywhere on your Mac.\n\n### Anthropic - Bigger, better, faster\n\nAnthropic's latest models, the Claude 3 series, have taken X by storm. This\nseries includes three models: Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. Each model has an\nimpressive context window of 200k tokens, handling an entire book.\nAdditionally, Opus has topped the Arena leaderboard, making it the most\nintelligent model available that can solve highly complex tasks with\nremarkable fluency.\n\n### Groq - Speed up mundane tasks\n\nOpen-source models have accelerated rapidly, and many see them as the future\nof LLMs. Raycast stands for speed, and so does Groq, which is the fastest\nmodel inference engine out there. Both Llama 2 70b and Mixtral 8x7b are\npowered by Groq, making those models the perfect choice for AI commands to\nspeed up your mundane tasks.\n\n## What\u2019s next?\n\nAI Commands are perfect for reusing prompts. We plan to bring similar\nabstractions to your AI Chats, allowing you to reuse models, system\ninstructions, and more. This way, you can build a personal library of\nassistants for your unique use cases.\n\nConsolidating multiple models in a single interface is also a key aspect of\nbecoming the UI for AI. All models are already available via our API to build\nyour own smart productivity tools. Bringing extensions closer to AI will\nunlock the next wave of productivity gains.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new models!
