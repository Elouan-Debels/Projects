Credit: CNSA\n\nHELSINKI \u2014 Thailand has signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation on\nthe China-led International Lunar Research Station (ILRS).\n\nThe memorandum of understanding was signed April 5 by Xu Zhanbin, deputy\nadministrator of the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and Permsuk\nSutchaphiwat, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Higher Education,\nScience, Research and Innovation (MHESI).\n\nThe two sides also signed an MoU on cooperation in the exploration and\npeaceful use of outer space, according to a CNSA statement.\n\nThailand and China will cooperate on the demonstration, project\nimplementation, operation and application of ILRS, according to CNSA. The pair\nwill organize expert teams to conduct research spanning science, engineering\nand international cooperation, and form a cooperation plan.\n\nThailand becomes the ninth country to join the ILRS. China and Russia formally\nannounced the joint project in St. Petersburg, Russia, in June 2021.\nVenezuela, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, South Africa and Egypt signed up\nduring 2023.\n\nThe China-led ILRS envisions constructing a permanent lunar base in the 2030s,\nwith precursor missions in the 2020s. These include Chang\u2019e-7 around 2026 and\nthe later Chang\u2019e-8 in-situ resource utilization technology test mission. Both\nmulti-spacecraft missions will target the lunar south pole.\n\nThe initiative is seen as a China-led, parallel project and potential\ncompetitor to the NASA-led Artemis Program. On the diplomatic front, Uruguay\nin February became the 36th country to sign the Artemis Accords which outline\nbest practices in lunar and deep space exploration.\n\nChina\u2019s Deep Space Exploration Laboratory (DSEL) under CNSA stated last year\nthat China aimed to complete the agreements with founding members of ILRS by\nOctober 2023. It appears this deadline has moved and China is still attracting\nfounding members.\n\nThailand is already engaged in the ILRS project. The National Astronomical\nResearch Institute of Thailand (NARIT) signed an agreement on cooperation in\nthe ILRS in September last year. This coincided with a payload proposed by the\ninstitute being announced as accepted to join China\u2019s future Chang\u2019e-7\nmission.\n\nNARIT is one of a series of other firms, universities and organizations that\nhave signed agreements on the ILRS.\n\nMarc Julienne, director of the Center for Asian Studies at the French\nInstitute of International Relations (IFRI), told SpaceNews last week that\nChina\u2019s space cooperation is focusing on the \u201cGlobal South,\u201d because of a lack\nof better alternatives and broader diplomatic reasons.\n\nChina and Russia initially hoped to attract European countries to join the\ninitiative. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 ended any hopes\nof such partnerships.\n\n## Thailand in space, ILRS groundwork\n\nThailand is not a major space player but is growing its space footprint. It\ndrafted a Space Activities Act in 2021 with the aim of promoting the country\u2019s\nspace-related economy and technologies. Its government approved a \u201cnational\nspace master plan 2023-2037\u201d in late 2022, defining eight strategies,\nincluding international cooperation, to boost its space economy for the\npurposes of national security, prosperity and sustainability.\n\nTHEOS-2, a remote sensing satellite built by Airbus Defence and Space for\nThailand\u2019s Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency, launched\non a Vega rocket last October. Satellite operator Thaicom has four satellites\noperational in geostationary orbit. It last month ordered a new, small GEO\nsatellite from Astranis for launch in 2025.\n\nPartnerships with countries like Japan and organizations such as the European\nSpace Agency (ESA) have helped in developing Thailand\u2019s space-related\ninfrastructure and expertise.\n\nMeanwhile China is moving ahead with its lunar exploration hardware. Last\nmonth China launched its Queqiao-2 lunar communications relay satellite. The\nspacecraft will facilitate the unprecedented Chang\u2019e-6 lunar far side sample\nreturn mission, due to launch next month. It will also later support the\nChang\u2019e-7 and later Chang\u2019e-8 missions to the lunar south pole landings.\n\nA pair of small navigation and communications technology test satellites\nlaunched along with Queqiao-2. The pair, Tiandu-1 and Tiandu-2, separated from\neach other in lunar orbit April 3.\n\n> Tiandu-1 and Tiandu-2 separated from each other yesterday, April 3.\n> https://t.co/puLjHVDb07 https://t.co/x1Qqzt2Gpr pic.twitter.com/tSnYbGSb7l\n>\n> \u2014 Andrew Jones (@AJ_FI) April 4, 2024\n\nA new-generation crew launch vehicle\u2014the Long March 10\u2014could have its test\nflight in 2025. Its larger, lunar version to follow.\n\nCrew will launch on one Long March 10 rocket, with an in-development lunar\nlander stack to launch separately on another. China aims to land its\nastronauts on the moon before 2030.\n\n### Related\n\n#### Egypt joins China\u2019s ILRS moon base initiative\n\nEgypt and China signed a series of space agreements Wednesday including\ncooperation on the China-led International Lunar Research Station.\n\n#### Pakistan becomes latest country to join China\u2019s ILRS moon project\n\nPakistan officially joined China\u2019s International Lunar Research Station, the\nChina National Space Administration announced Friday.\n\n#### Emirati university signs up to China\u2019s moon base project\n\nChina has added a United Arab Emirates\u2019 university to its list of partners for\nthe country\u2019s moon base ambitions.\n\nTagged: China, ILRS, Moon, Thailand\n\n## Andrew Jones\n\nAndrew Jones covers China's space industry for SpaceNews.
