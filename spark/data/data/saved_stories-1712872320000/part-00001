Folks felt they were promised a grand\n\u201cHollywood\u201d style sign overlooking Detroit\u2019s busiest freeway. What we got were\neight-foot tall green letters on two foot tall cement pedestals in the\nSouthwest of the city. However, residents really only have themselves to blame\nfor their disappointment after falling for an AI-generated images that never\ncould have worked in real life.\n\nToyota Unveils The Sixth Generation 4Runner\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nToyota Unveils The Sixth Generation 4Runner\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where the initial AI generated image even came from, but one\nthing is for sure\u2014it went viral in the Motor City. Assumptions were made, and\nwe all know what assuming does (it makes an ass out of you and me.) Speaking\nof asses, Michigan Senate Republicans took to Twitter/X to blame the state\u2019s\ndemocrats, which is just about as dumb as thinking this AI-generated sign\nwould ever appear in real life:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK so, first off\u2014that AI image is so obviously, painfully fake. Look at the\nweird layout of the freeway, for one. Does that look like something a\nprofessional designer would do? There\u2019s no grassy medians on freeways in the\ncity proper, and no tri-directional freeways at all. Not to mention, as anyone\nwith a passing experience with Detroit freeways knows, the placement would\nhave never worked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI image also seems to have the sign installed along I-75, where the\nfreeway is actually sunken anyway with high concrete walls on either side, has\nextremely steep grass embankments or the freeway is elevated above cross\nstreets and other freeways the further you get from downtown. Along the side\nof that freeway are factories, warehouses, neighborhoods and other buildings\nthat aren\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. There are no large expanses of green\nor embankments close enough to the Renaissance Center that would accommodate a\nsign of this size in such a location, let alone the obvious construction and\nroad closures that would have needed to take place to install a huge sign. The\nHollywood sign letters are 30 feet tall. Construction of a similar sign along\none of the city\u2019s busiest freeways would have been noticeable months before\nthe NFL draft came to town this April.\n\nAll the city did was announce the constuction of this sign and a few other\nimprovements. Officials made no grandiose promises, some shady AI image did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actual sign was installed along I-94 in Southwest Detroit, fairly close to\nwhere trucks cross the Ambassador bridge into and out of Canada. The 10-foot\ngreen letters are fine! We probably could have put that $400,000 to better\nuse, but it\u2019s certainly not the worst thing to ever happen in this city (not\nby a long shot.)\n\nDetroiters are used to disappointment at this point. Consider the big promises\nof public transit via streetcars, which fizzled out into a single privately\nowned streetcar line that only travels 3.3 miles along Woodward Avenue. Or the\npromised tearing down of I-375\u2014the shortest and most pointless freeway in the\nU.S.\u2014which was supposed to give the streets back to the people and honor the\nthriving Black neighborhood that was destroyed for its construction. The\nactual plan is to just a busy eight-lane stroad\u2014basically just a freeway but\nnow with crosswalks and benches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, disappointment is in plentiful supply in Detroit, but this time we only\nhave ourselves to blame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n", "frontpage": false}
