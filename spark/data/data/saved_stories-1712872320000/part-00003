Before\nTTH creator Ahoyo admitted to his TAS exploit last month, the player community\nat large didn't think it was even possible to precisely automate such pre-\nrecorded inputs on the Wii U.\n\nThe first confirmed clear of Trimming the Herbs by a human.\n\nNow, speaking to Ars, Ahoyo has finally explained the console hacking that\nwent into his clandestine TAS so many years ago and opened up about the\nphysical and psychological motivations for the level's creation. He also\ndiscussed the remorse he feels over what ended up being a years-long fraud on\nthe community, which is still struggling with frame-perfect input timing\nissues that seem inherent to the Wii U hardware.\n\n\"I see discussing it as sort of a reputation damage control,\" Ahoyo told Ars.\n\"I saw value in the 'ruckus' that TTH would cause, in that it would bring in\noutside eyes to look at SMM with uncertainty and excitement... but it was a\nbetrayal of my competitive values.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Hardware hacking\n\n### Further Reading\n\nThe Super Mario Maker community faces its final boss\n\nAhoyo recalled first hearing of the possibility of a Super Mario Maker TAS in\n\"late 2015 or early 2016\" when a viewer of his Twitch streams messaged him\nabout a Wii U TAS project they had been tinkering with. In response to a\nfollow-up in June 2016, the viewer sent a video \"showing a controller attached\nto a Raspberry Pi and showed how it was controlling Mario on the screen,\"\nAhoyo told Ars.\n\nWhile the viewer told Ahoyo they had since \"abandoned\" their efforts to get\nreliable TAS recording on the Wii U, Ahoyo said he \"showed the video of their\nhardware to my friend, and he told me he thought it would be easy to\nreplicate, so after an Amazon order, he built it.\" This kind of level of\nautomation was \"not something I [had] thought about before,\" Ahoyo said. \"In\nthe video demo I was sent about the TAS, it appeared to me like it was working\nfine. I thought it was a waste to abandon the project, so I pursued it\nspontaneously. I was just at the right place at the right time.\"\n\nEnlarge / The inner workings of the Wii U GamePad mainboard.\n\nKoushirowolf / Reddit\n\nAs you can see from the pictures atop this article, setting up a Wii U to play\nback pre-recorded inputs isn't exactly a plug-and-play affair. Ahoyo's setup\ninvolves an Arduino with multiple external connections to a breadboard, each\none representing a button on the Wii U GamePad. Those outputs are first fed\ninto a pair of 10-pin converter boards, then directly onto the Wii U gamepad\nmainboard via ribbon cables (fed through holes cut into the existing rear\nmounting holes on the GamePad). A separate set of colored physical buttons\nconnects to the breadboard to control the playback of the TAS scripts through\nthe Arduino, Ahoyo said.\n\n\"It turns out my hunch was correct; this was a bespoke, hand-crafted solution\nspecifically for Super Mario Maker,\" tool-assisted speedrun expert and TASbot\nkeeper Allan \"dwangoAC\" Cecil told Ars after seeing the setup. The solution\nAhoyo and his friend rigged up \"isn't general purpose in any way that likely\nwouldn't have worked for anything else,\" Cecil added.\n\n#### reader comments\n\n27\n\nKyle Orland Kyle Orland has been the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica\nsince 2012, writing primarily about the business, tech, and culture behind\nvideo games.

Only sanyx91smm2 breathing at the end\n> like they'd just seen the face of God really gives any indication of the\n> difficulty.\n\nI think that's part of what caused Ahoyo's troll to stay hidden for so long:\nit's much harder than it looks. I think that's also why it became the last\nuncleared level in the Team 0% project before it was disqualified: it's so\nshort and deceptively simply that when players couldn't clear it right away,\nthey thought \"Oh well, time to move on and work on another level, that'll take\nmore time/effort to beat. I'll either then come back to this level at some\npoint, or someone else will have cleared it.\" The fiendish difficulty of it\nwas hiding in plain sight.\n\nI think sanyx91smm2 should get some sort of \"John Henry\" award for beating a\nlevel thought only beatable by machine by the creator.\n\nApril 11, 2024 at 1:00 pm\n\ndwangoAC\n\n> It would be interesting to see if they got more consistent results with a\n> wired connection. Does the Wii U even support that?\n\nI'm hopeful we can find a path forward to perform some kind of tests on\nunmodified hardware but the Wii U GameCube controller adapter only works with\nSuper Smash Bros and we don't currently have a way to determine the frame-\nperfect accuracy of that. However, I've worked with Ownasaurus and other folks\nin my TASBot community to play back perfect inputs on a GameCube so we know\nthat part can be reliable.\n\nApril 11, 2024 at 1:09 pm\n\n### Channel Ars Technica\n\n#### Unsolved Mysteries Of Quantum Leap With Donald P.
