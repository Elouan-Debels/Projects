It can be played in\nany HTML5 capable web-browser and features in-depth game-play and a wide\nvariety of game modes and options. Your goal is to build cities, collect\nresources, organize your government, and build an army, with the ultimate goal\nof creating the best civilization. You can play online against other players\n(multiplayer) or play by yourself against the computer. There is both a HTML5\n2D version with isometric graphics and a 3D WebGL version of Freeciv-web.\n\nFreeciv-web is free and open source software. The Freeciv C server is released\nunder the GNU General Public License, while the Freeciv-web client is released\nunder the GNU Affero General Public License. See License for the full license\ndocument.\n\n## Live servers\n\nCurrently known servers based on Freeciv-web, which are open source in\ncompliance with the AGPL license:\n\n  * FCIV.NET [https://github.com/fciv-net/fciv-net]\n  * freecivweb.org [https://github.com/Lexxie9952/fcw.org-server]\n  * moving borders [https://github.com/lonemadmax/freeciv-web] (Everything except longturn and real-Earth)\n  * Freeciv Tactics & Triumph [https://github.com/Canik05/freeciv-tnt] Freeciv Games & Mods (No PBEM)\n\n## Freeciv-web screenshots:\n\nFreeciv WebGL 3D:\n\nFreeciv-web HTML5 version:\n\n## Overview\n\nFreeciv-Web consists of these components:\n\n  * Freeciv-web - a Java web application for the Freeciv-web client. This application is a Java web application which make up the application viewed in each user's web browser. The Metaserver is also a part of this module. Implemented in Javascript, Java, JSP, HTML and CSS. Built with maven and runs on Tomcat 10 and nginx.\n\n  * Freeciv - the Freeciv C server, which is checked out from the official Git repository, and patched to work with a WebSocket/JSON protocol. Implemented in C.\n\n  * Freeciv-proxy - a WebSocket proxy which allows WebSocket clients in Freeciv-web to send socket requests to Freeciv servers. WebSocket requests are sent from Javascript in Freeciv-web to nginx, which then proxies the WebSocket messages to freeciv-proxy, which finally sends Freeciv socket requests to the Freeciv servers. Implemented in Python.\n\n  * Publite2 - a process launcher for Freeciv C servers, which manages multiple Freeciv server processes and checks capacity through the Metaserver. Implemented in Python.\n\n  * pbem is play-by-email support.\n\n## Freeciv WebGL\n\nFreeciv WebGL is the 3D version, which uses the Three.js 3D engine. More info\nabout the WebGL 3D version can be found for developers and 3D artists.\nDeveloper: Andreas R\u00f8sdal @andreasrosdal\n\n## Running Freeciv-web on your computer\n\nThe recommended and probably easiest way is to use Vagrant on VirtualBox.\n\nWhatever the method you choose, you'll have to check out Freeciv-web to a\ndirectory on your computer, by installing Git and running this command:\n\n    \n    \n    git clone https://github.com/freeciv/freeciv-web.git --depth=10\n\nYou may also want to change some parameters before installing, although it's\nnot needed in most cases. If you have special requirements, have a look at\nconfig.dist, copy it without the .dist extension and edit to your liking.\n\n#### \u26a0\ufe0f Notice for Windows users\n\nPlease keep in mind that the files are to be used in a Unix-like system (some\nUbuntu version with the provided Vagrant file). Line endings for text files\nare different in Windows, and some editors \"correct\" them, making the files\nunusable in the VM. There's some provision to recode the main configuration\nfiles when installing, but not afterwards. If you touch shared files after\ninstallation, please use an editor that respect Unix line endings or transform\nthem with a utility like dos2unix after saving them.\n\n### Running Freeciv-web with Vagrant on VirtualBox\n\nFreeciv-web can be setup using Vagrant on VirtualBox to quickly create a local\ndeveloper image running Freeciv-web on latest Ubuntu on your host operating\nsystem such as Windows, OSX or Linux. This is the recommended way to build\nFreeciv-web on your computer.\n\n  1. Install VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/ - Install manually on Windows, and with the following command on Linux:\n\n    \n    \n    sudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\n  2. Install Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/ - Install manually on Windows , and with the following command on Linux:\n\n    \n    \n    sudo apt-get install vagrant\n\n  3. Run Vagrant with the following commands in your Freeciv-web directory:\n\n    \n    \n    vagrant up\n\nThis will build, compile, install and run Freeciv-web on the virtual server\nimage. Wait for the installation process to complete, watching for any error\nmessages in the logs. If you get an error message about Virtualization (VT)\nnot working, then enable Virtualization in the BIOS.\n\n  4. Test Freeciv-web by pointing your browser to http://localhost if you run Windows or http://localhost:8080 if you run Linux or macOS.\n\nTo log in to your Vagrant server, run the command:\n\n    \n    \n    vagrant ssh\n\nThe Vagrant guest machine will mount the Freeciv-web source repository in the\n/vagrant directory. Note that running Freeciv-web using Vagrant requires about\n4Gb of memory and 3 Gb of harddisk space.\n\n### System Requirements for manual install\n\nInstall this software if you are not running Freeciv-web with Vagrant:\n\n  * Tomcat 10 - https://tomcat.apache.org/\n\n  * Java 11 JDK - https://adoptopenjdk.net/\n\n  * Python 3.6 - http://www.python.org/\n\n  * Pillow v2.3.0 (PIL fork) - http://pillow.readthedocs.org/ (required for freeciv-img-extract)\n\n  * MariaDB - https://mariadb.org/\n\n  * Maven 3 - http://maven.apache.org/download.html\n\n  * Firebug for debugging - http://getfirebug.com/\n\n  * curl-7.19.7 - http://curl.haxx.se/\n\n  * OpenSSL - http://www.openssl.org/\n\n  * nginx 1.11.x or later - http://nginx.org/\n\n  * MySQL Connector/Python - https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-python\n\n  * pngcrush, required for freeciv-img-extract. http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/\n\n  * Tornado 6.1 or later - http://www.tornadoweb.org/\n\n  * Jansson 2.6 - http://www.digip.org/jansson/\n\n  * liblzma-dev - http://tukaani.org/xz/ - for XZ compressed savegames.\n\nWhen in a tested system, you may run scripts/install/install.sh and it will\nfetch and configure what's needed.\n\nStart and stop Freeciv-web with the following commands: start-freeciv-web.sh\nstop-freeciv-web.sh status-freeciv-web.sh\n\nAll software components in Freeciv-web will log to the /logs sub-directory of\nthe Freeciv-web installation.\n\n### Running Freeciv-web on Docker\n\nFreeciv-web can easily be built and run from Docker using docker-compose.\n\n  1. Make sure you have both Docker and Docker Compose installed.\n\n  2. Run the following from the freeciv-web directory:\n    \n        docker-compose up -d\n\n  3. Connect to docker via host machine using standard browser\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/\n\nEnjoy. The overall dockerfile and required changes to scripts needs some\nfurther improvements.\n\n## Freeciv-Web continuous integration on GitHub actions\n\nFreeciv-Web is built on GitHub actions on every commit.
