The company surveyed 13,000 developers and 5,500 technical recruiters for the report.\n  * More than two-thirds of developers say they feel more security in their roles compared to 2023. Just 1 in 5 are concerned about stability compared to last year.\n  * Interest in job mobility among software developers signals a clear challenge for CIOs and executives to keep employees challenged, motivated and excited about their work, CoderPad CEO Amanda Richardson said.\n\n### Dive Insight:\n\nThe first days of the new year struck a familiar note to January 2023, with\nhundreds of workers being laid off at several technology companies.\n\nXerox cut 15% of its workforce as part of a broader restructuring last week, a\nmove that impacted roughly 3,000 workers. Videogame software maker Unity\nSoftware cut 1,800 positions Monday, and Amazon-owned Twitch announced\nWednesday it would lay off 500 employees.\n\nThus far this year, 2,300 tech employees have been cut, according to\nLayoffs.fyi. Comparatively, almost 90,000 tech workers were laid off in\nJanuary of last year.\n\n\"I think it's short sighted to say 'there were a lot of layoffs in 2023, there\nare no jobs out there, devs won't go anywhere and who cares how we treat\nthem,'\" said Richardson. \"I think this data shows that's not at all true, that\ngood people will find new jobs and they'll find new jobs that fit them.\"\n\n\"Thinking about your talent retention strategy will be important this year,\"\nRichardson said.\n\nTech employees mulling a move this year say they're mostly drawn by better\nadvancement opportunities, higher pay or new work challenges.\n\nDespite an uptick in December, IT unemployment trailed national averages all\nyear in 2023, signaling a small pool of available workers in technology in\nrelation to the amount of open jobs across industries.\n\nAnalysts expect that deficit to persist in the new year, though the onslaught\nof generative AI tool adoption could help lower the barrier of entry to\ntechnology roles, effectively increasing the number of potential new hires.\n\n  * post\n  * share\n  * tweet\n  * print\n  * email\n  * license\n\nFiled Under: Software, Leadership\n\n### CIO Dive news delivered to your inbox\n\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n### Editors' picks\n\n  * Explore the Trendline\u2794\n\ndem10 via Getty Images\n\nTrendline\n\n### Generative AI\n\nCompanies are pushing technology executives to leverage generative AI, a task\nthat requires customize strategies and the necessary guardrails.\n\nBy CIO Dive staff\n\n  * Permission granted by Unqork\n\n### From CIO to CEO: How Gary Hoberman made the leap to startup land\n\nThe Unqork founder spent two decades grappling with technical debt.
