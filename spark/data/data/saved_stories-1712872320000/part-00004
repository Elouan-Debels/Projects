Each prodverb links to a talk or article that describes the\nprinciples in more detail. This is our first collection of prodverbs \u2014 look\nfor more here in the coming months!\n\n### If two systems must agree for them to work, someday they will inevitably\ndisagree.\n\nShare\n\n  * \u00d7\n\nShare\n\n  * \u00d7\n\nShare\n\n  * \u00d7\n\nShare\n\n  * \u00d7\n\nShare\n\n  * \u00d7\n\nShare\n\n  * \u00d7\n\nShare\n\n  * \u00d7\n\n## 01/07\n\nFollow us\n\n  * About Google\n  * Google products\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms\n\n  * Help\n\n", "frontpage": false}
