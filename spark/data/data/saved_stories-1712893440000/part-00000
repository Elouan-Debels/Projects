It underpins modern civilization even while consuming more energy,\nwealth, and time than it needs to and burping out a significant amount of\ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The software industry and the code it\nships need to be much more efficient in order to minimize the emissions\nattributable to programs running in data centers and over transmission\nnetworks. Two approaches to software development featured in Spectrum\u2018s April\n2024 issue can help us get there.\n\nIn \u201cWhy Bloat Is Still Software\u2019s Biggest Vulnerability,\u201d Bert Hubert pays\nhomage to the famed computer scientist and inventor of Pascal, Niklaus Wirth,\nwhose influential essay \u201cA Plea for Lean Software\u201d appeared in IEEE Computer\nin 1995. Wirth\u2019s essay built on a methodology first conceived by Spectrum\ncontributing editor Robert N. Charette, who in the early 1990s adapted the\nToyota Production System for software development.\n\nHubert points out that bloated code offers giant attack surfaces for bad\nactors. Malicious hacks and ransomware attacks, not to mention run-of-the-mill\nsoftware failures, are like the weather now: partly cloudy with a 50 percent\nchance of your app crashing or your personal information being circulated on\nthe Dark Web. Back in the day, limited compute resources forced programmers to\nwrite lean code. Now, with much more robust resources at hand, coders are\nwriting millions of lines of code for relatively simple apps that call on\nhundreds of libraries of, as Hubert says, \u201cunknown provenance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an already existing large segment of the software-development\necosystem that cares about this space\u2014they just haven\u2019t known what to do.\u201d\n\u2014Asim Hussain, Green Web Foundation\n\nAmong other things, he argues for legislation along the lines of what the\nEuropean Union is trying to enforce: \u201cNIS2 for important services; the Cyber\nResilience Act for almost all commercial software and electronic devices; and\na revamped Product Liability Directive that also extends to software.\u201d Hubert,\na software developer himself, walks the lean walk: His 3-megabyte image-\nsharing program Trifecta does the same job as other programs that use hundreds\nof megabytes of code.\n\nLean software should, in theory, be green software. In other words, it should\nrun so efficiently that it reduces the amount of energy used in data centers\nand transmission networks. Overall, the IT and communications sectors are\nestimated to account for 2 to 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions\nand, according to one 2018 study, could by 2040 reach 14 percent. And that\nstudy came out prior to the explosion in AI applications, whose insatiable\nhunger for computing resources and the power required to feed the algorithms\nexacerbates an already complicated problem.\n\nThankfully, several groups are working on solutions, including the Green Web\nFoundation. The GWF was spun up almost 20 years ago to figure out how the\nInternet is powered, and now has a goal of a fossil-free Internet by 2030.\n\nThere are three main ways to achieve that objective, according to the\nfoundation\u2019s chair and executive director Asim Hussain: Use less energy, use\nfewer physical resources, and use energy more prudently\u2014by, for instance,\nhaving your apps do more when there\u2019s power from wind and solar available and\nless when there\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an already existing large segment of the software-development\necosystem that cares about this space\u2014they just haven\u2019t known what to do,\u201d\nHussain told Spectrum contributing editor Rina Diane Caballar. They do now,\nthanks to Caballar\u2019s extensive reporting and the handy how-to guide she\nincludes in \u201cWe Need to Decarbonize Software.\u201d Programmers have the tools to\nmake software leaner and greener. Now it\u2019s up to them, and as we\u2019ve seen in\nthe EU, their legislators, to make sustainable and secure code their top\npriority. Software doesn\u2019t have to suck.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * Generative AI\u2019s Energy Problem Today Is Foundational \u203a\n  * Why Bloat Is Still Software\u2019s Biggest Vulnerability \u203a\n  * We Need to Decarbonize Software \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Green Software Foundation | GSF \u203a\n\nclimate changeclimate techgreen softwarelean softwaresoftwaresoftware\nengineeringsoftware development\n\nHarry Goldstein\n\nis Editor in Chief of IEEE Spectrum.

Every nightfall, cranks mounted on a floating\nplatform lower the ring 125 meters below the surface to expose the seaweed to\ncooler, more nutrient-rich water. At daybreak, the cranks pull the ring back\nup to the surface to soak up sunlight and carbon dioxide.\n\nThe Climate Foundation, the Seattle-based company behind the project, has\nfound that this deep cycling makes kelp grow three times as fast as it can\nwhen kept in shallow waters, as seaweed farmers do now. The extra kelp can be\nturned into food, fertilizer, and fuel, or it can be committed to the deep,\nlocking away countless tonnes of carbon for centuries.\n\nKeep Reading \u2193 Show less\n\nEnergy Aerospace Interview\n\n## Caltech\u2019s SSPD-1 Is a New Idea for Space-Based Solar\n\n###\n\nAli Hajimiri on boosting an energy-beaming system from the lab to orbit\n\nW.

Several recently\npublished deep-dive analyses commissioned by NASA and the European Space\nAgency have thrown cold water on the hope that space solar power could\naffordably generate many gigawatts of clean energy in the near future. And yet\nthe dream lives on.\n\nThe dream achieved a kind of lift-off in January 2023. That\u2019s when SSPD-1, a\nsolar space-power demonstrator satellite carrying a bevy of new technologies\ndesigned at the California Institute of Technology, blasted into low Earth\norbit for a year-long mission. Mindful of concerns about the technical\nfeasibility of robotic in-space assembly of satellites, each an order of\nmagnitude larger than the International Space Station, the Caltech team has\nbeen looking at very different approaches to space solar power.\n\nKeep Reading \u2193 Show less\n\n{\"imageShortcodeIds\":[]}\n\nRobotics Artificial Intelligence Interview\n\n## Marco Hutter Wants to Solve Robotics\u2019 Hard Problems\n\n###\n\nThe AI Institute\u2019s new Zurich head will focus on reliable, mobile robots\n\nEvan Ackerman\n\nEvan Ackerman is a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum.

This\nimprovisation is most conspicuous in the ceaselessly evolving struggle between\nweaponized drones and electronic warfare, a cornerstone of this war.\n\nWeaponized civilian first-person-view (FPV) drones began dramatically\nreshaping the landscape of the war in the summer of 2023. Prior to this\nrevolution, various commercial drones played critical roles, primarily for\nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Since 2014, the main means of\ndefending against these drones has been electronic warfare (EW), in its many\nforms. The iterative, lethal dance between drones and EW has unfolded a rich\ntechnological tapestry, revealing insights into a likely future of warfare\nwhere EW and drones intertwine.\n\nKeep Reading \u2193 Show less\n\nAerospace News\n\n## ESA Satellites to Test Razor-Sharp Formation Flying\n\n###\n\nProba-3 will make its own solar eclipses\u2014and assess precision orbital tech\n\nAndrew Jones\n\nAndrew Jones is a freelance journalist based near Helsinki.
