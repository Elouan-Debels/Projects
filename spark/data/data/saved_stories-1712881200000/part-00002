It\u2019s not our fault\u2014the spans of time in human history, and even more\nso in natural history, are so vast compared to the span of our life and recent\nhistory that it\u2019s almost impossible to get a handle on it. If the Earth formed\nat midnight and the present moment is the next midnight, 24 hours later,\nmodern humans have been around since 11:59:59pm\u20141 second. And if human history\nitself spans 24 hours from one midnight to the next, 14 minutes represents the\ntime since Christ.\n\nTo try to grasp some perspective, I mapped out the history of time as a series\nof growing timelines\u2014each timeline contains all the previous timelines (colors\nwill help you see which timelines are which). All timeline lengths are exactly\naccurate to the amount of time they\u2019re expressing.\n\nA note on dates: When it comes to the far-back past, most of the dates we know\nare the subject of ongoing debate. For these timelines, it\u2019s cumbersome to put\na ~ sign before every ancient date or an asterisk explaining that the date is\nstill being debated, so I just used the most widely accepted dates and left it\nat that.\n\nFor teachers and parents and people who hate cursing: here\u2019s a clean, Rated G\nversion.\n\nPosters You can get the poster of this graphic here. It comes in both normal\nposter size and long skinny vertical size. And a prettier, less offensive\nversion.\n\n___________\n\nIf you liked this, these are for you too:\n\nThe AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence \u2013 A closer, somewhat\nhorrifying look at the future\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Big Fucking Rocket: The Full Story \u2013 A post I got to work on with\nElon Musk that convinced me that humans will be on Mars by 2025.\n\nThe Fermi Paradox \u2013 We\u2019ve never seen signs of alien life, even though it seems\nlike we should have\u2014so where is everybody?\n\nAnd two other big graphics I made that also took me 900 years:\n\nHorizontal History \u2013 This one puts human history in perspective\n\nThe Death Toll Comparison Chart \u2013 A lot of people die a lot\n\n_______\n\nIf you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new\nposts when they come out.\n\nTo support Wait But Why, visit our Patreon page.\n\n62Save\n\n#### About Tim Urban\n\nView all posts by Tim Urban \u2192\n\nPrevious Post\n\nNext Post\n\n### RECOMMENDED POSTS\n\n  * ##### All My Thoughts After 40 Hours in the Vision Pro\n\nFebruary 9, 2024\n\n  * ##### The Big and the Small\n\nSeptember 22, 2020\n\n  * ##### Neuralink and the Brain\u2019s Magical Future\n\nApril 20, 2017\n\nHome Archive\n\nPowered by Ajaxy\n\n#### Post Types\n\n  * Post (216)\n  * Forum Topic (85)\n  * Page (44)\n  * Mandarin (10)\n\n#### Categories\n\n  * Uncategorized (127)\n  * Dinner Table Topics (84)\n  * Category #1 (59)\n  * Minis (42)\n  * The Shed (31)\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * funny (38)\n  * science (29)\n  * psychology (21)\n  * society (21)\n  * selfhelp (16)\n\n#### Year\n\n  * 2024 (2)\n  * 2023 (43)\n  * 2021 (2)\n  * 2020 (4)\n  * 2019 (2)\n\nJoin 601K other humans and have new posts emailed to you.\n\nFollow these special men\n\n408,687\n\n771,601\n\n203,395\n\n  * ##### Popular Posts\n\n  * ##### The AI Revolution\n\nJanuary 22, 2015 1,157\n\n  * ##### Why Procrastinators Procrastinate\n\nOctober 30, 2013 591\n\n  * ##### The Fermi Paradox\n\nMay 21, 2014 1,420\n\n  * ##### How (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars\n\nAugust 16, 2015 976\n\n  * ##### How to Pick a Life Partner\n\nFebruary 12, 2014 314\n\n  * ##### Why Gen Y Yuppies Are Unhappy\n\nSeptember 9, 2013 1,231\n\n  * ##### Putting Time In Perspective\n\nAugust 22, 2013 568\n\n  * ##### How to Name a Baby\n\nDecember 11, 2013 330\n\n  * ##### Why You Should Stop Caring What Other People Think\n\nJune 13, 2014 364\n\n  * ##### Religion for the Nonreligious\n\nOctober 19, 2014 843\n\n  * ##### The Tail End\n\nDecember 11, 2015 316\n\n  * ##### From Muhammad to ISIS: Iraq's Full Story\n\nSeptember 12, 2014 329\n\nFollow these special men\n\n408,687\n\n771,601\n\n203,395\n\n#### Popular Posts\n\n  * Tales From the Eclipse\n  * All My Thoughts After 40 Hours in the Vision Pro\n  * The Ant-Honey Problem\n  * 10 Thoughts From the Fourth Trimester\n  * Idea Labs Opt-Out\n  * Audiobook\n  * A Short History of My Last Six Years\n  * What\u2019s Our Problem?
