We are building Sirji as a VS Code extension.\n\nWe launched the Sirji VS Code extension on both the Visual Studio marketplace\nand the Open VSX repository last week.\n\nThe positive feedback so far: The installation is a breeze (under 10 seconds,\nseriously!), and the UI is quite intuitive. The extension seamlessly\nintegrates with VS Code, making it super easy to use in the local development\nenvironment.\n\nOf course, along with the positive feedback, there have been hiccups, problems\nand frustrations that our early users reported. Keep them coming, please.\nThese are super valuable as we continue building Sirji.\n\nAnd since we are building Sirji in public, best to share all our challenges\npublicly as well.\n\nHere\u2019s a compilation of all of Sirji\u2019s challenges.\n\n## Leaving things incomplete\n\nWe've noticed several recurring issues where Sirji says it is done solving the\nproblem but doesn\u2019t fully implement the expected functionalities. The key\nproblems include:\n\n  * Frontend and backend integration: Often, Sirji skips the necessary integration between the frontend and backend components of the projects. This leaves the features non-functional even though Sirji reports completion.\n  * Frontend implementation issues: In some scenarios, the frontend components of a feature are not implemented at all.\n  * Linking between files is missing: Sirji frequently neglects to link files correctly. For example, while developing a React App, it usually misses linking files from the main App.js file.\n  * Assumed changes: There have been instances where Sirji hallucinates and acts as though certain changes or additions have been made to the code without actually implementing them.\n\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues/56\n\n## Unable to debug web errors\n\nCurrently, Sirji cannot detect when a user encounters errors with web pages.\nThis limitation hinders Sirji's autonomous debugging abilities, making it\nreliant on users to report errors by copying and pasting them as manual\nfeedback. Enhancing Sirji with error detection for web page interactions would\ngreatly improve its self-diagnostic and troubleshooting capabilities.\n\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues/57\n\n## Inability to recognize its own capability\n\nSirji often displays the message \"Outside of my capability\" for tasks that are\nactually within its capabilities, leading to unnecessary interruptions in\nworkflow.\n\nThis issue is particularly notable in these scenarios:\n\n  * Installation of databases (like MongoDB)\n  * Verification of an installation\n\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues/58\n\n## Invalid message format\n\nSirji sometimes receives messages in invalid format from LLM. We have an\nerror-catching mechanism in which we again ask LLM to give a response as per\nthe defined message protocol. In this case, even after 2 retries (again\ncalling OpenAI completions API with the feedback that the last message was\ninvalid), LLM doesn\u2019t respond in a proper format. This primarily happens when\nLLM has to give some information to the user, to act on but this action is\nmissing from the protocol.\n\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues/59\n\n## Installing system-wide packages without confirming\n\nAt times, Sirji installs system-wide packages like Python without seeking user\napproval. A confirmation step would ensure users are aware and agreeable to\nchanges being made to their system.\n\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues/60\n\n## Server issues\n\nWe're encountering multiple issues with how Sirji handles server processes,\nparticularly starting, restarting, and logging.\n\nBelow are the specific problems:\n\n  * Server start-up: Occasionally, Sirji forgets to start the server as expected after the solution is complete.\n  * Server restart issue: Sirji does not automatically restart the server after updating the code. Consequently, the modifications are not reflected.\n  * Log file overwriting: The logs from running servers are not uniquely preserved. They risk being overwritten by subsequent processes.\n\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues/61\n\n## Files are created outside of workspace\n\nThere is an issue where Sirji occasionally attempts to create files and\nfolders outside the designated workspace. This behavior is concerning because\nit can interfere with the user's other files. A specific instance of this\nproblem was observed when Sirji navigated to the home directory (~) and\nstarted creating files there (oops!).\n\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues/62\n\n## Can\u2019t use third-party APIs that need keys\n\nSirji gives up or implements outline code when the third-party APIs need keys.\nFor Sirji to effectively interact with third-party APIs, it needs to ask users\nto input the necessary API keys. Users should be prompted to enter these keys\ninto an environment variable file, enabling Sirji to securely access them from\nthe generated code.\n\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues/63\n\n## UI from the 90s\n\nUnless specifically directed, Sirji creates webpages like they are from the\n1990s.\n\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues/64\n\n## Progress steps are buggy\n\nThe steps are not always updated to their respective status from \u2018not running\u2019\nto 'running' to 'completed'. This inconsistency affects the overall task\ntracking.\n\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues/65\n\n## Continuing before package installations complete\n\nSirji does not pause its process for the completion of long-running package\ninstallations. This leads to subsequent steps erroneously assuming the\nnecessary packages are installed, causing failures.\n\nGitHub Issue: https://github.com/sirji-ai/sirji/issues/66\n\n...\n\nAny other problems that you encountered?\n\nOur next milestone is going to be about making Sirji reliable. Stay tuned!\n\n#### Kedar Chandrayan\n\nWebsite More posts\n\nI focus on understanding the WHY of each requirement. Once this is clear, then\nHOW becomes easy. In my blogs too, I try to take the same approach.\n\nPrevious Post\n\n### You might also like...\n\n## Sirji Updates - VS Code Extension (launch)\n\nApr 12, 2024 1 min read SirjiArtificial Intelligence\n\n## Sirji Updates - Episode 3 (The first run)\n\nMar 23, 2024 1 min read SirjiArtificial Intelligence\n\n## Sirji Updates - Episode 2\n\nMar 21, 2024 1 min read SirjiArtificial Intelligence\n\nPowered by Ghost\n\n# Let's talk.\n\nhi@truesparrow.com\n\n\u00a9 2023 True Sparrow Systems Pvt.
