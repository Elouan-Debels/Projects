But we can\nrevitalize it using lessons learned by ecologists.\n\nNoah Campeau for Noema Magazine\n\nEssayDigital Society\n\nBy Maria Farrell and Robin Berjon April 16, 2024\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nCredits\n\nMaria Farrell is a writer and speaker on technology and the future. She has\nworked on technology policy at the International Chamber of Commerce, ICANN\nand The World Bank.\n\nRobin Berjon is an expert in digital governance and has contributed to\nnumerous web standards, including the Global Privacy Control (GPC). He works\non novel web protocols such as IPFS and sits on the W3C\u2019s Board of Directors\nand the ICO\u2019s Technology Advisory Panel.\n\n\u201cThe word for world is forest\u201d \u2014 Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nIn the late 18th century, officials in Prussia and Saxony began to rearrange\ntheir complex, diverse forests into straight rows of single-species trees.\nForests had been sources of food, grazing, shelter, medicine, bedding and more\nfor the people who lived in and around them, but to the early modern state,\nthey were simply a source of timber.\n\nSo-called \u201cscientific forestry,\u201d was that century\u2019s growth hacking: it made\ntimber yields easier to count, predict and harvest, and meant owners no longer\nrelied on skilled local foresters to manage forests. They were replaced with\nlower-skilled laborers following basic algorithmic instructions to keep the\nmonocrop tidy, the understory bare.\n\nInformation and decision-making power now flowed straight to the top. Decades\nlater when the first crop was felled, vast fortunes were made, tree by\nstandardized tree. The clear-felled forests were replanted, ready to extend\nthe boom. Readers of the American political anthropologist of anarchy and\norder, James C. Scott, know what happened next.\n\nIt was a disaster so bad that a new word, Waldsterben, or \u201cforest death,\u201d was\nminted to describe the result. All the same species and age, the trees were\nflattened in storms, ravaged by insects and disease \u2014 even the survivors were\nspindly and weak. Forests were now so tidy and bare they were all but dead.\nThe first magnificent bounty had not been the beginning of endless riches, but\na one-off harvesting of millennia of soil wealth built up by biodiversity and\nsymbiosis. Complexity was the goose that laid golden eggs, and she had been\nslaughtered.\n\nThe story of German scientific forestry transmits a timeless truth: When we\nsimplify complex systems, we destroy them, and the devastating consequences\nsometimes aren\u2019t obvious until it\u2019s too late.\n\nThat impulse to scour away the messiness that makes life resilient is what\nmany conservation biologists call the \u201cpathology of command and control.\u201d\nToday, the same drive to centralize, control and extract has driven the\ninternet to the same fate as the ravaged forests.\n\nThe internet\u2019s 2010s, its boom years, may have been the first glorious harvest\nthat exhausted a one-time bonanza of diversity. The complex web of human\ninteractions that thrived on the internet\u2019s initial technological diversity is\nnow corralled into globe-spanning data-extraction engines making huge fortunes\nfor a tiny few.\n\nOur online spaces are not ecosystems, though tech firms love that word.\nThey\u2019re plantations; highly concentrated and controlled environments, closer\nkin to the industrial farming of the cattle feedlot or battery chicken farms\nthat madden the creatures trapped within.\n\nWe all know this. We see it each time we reach for our phones. But what most\npeople have missed is how this concentration reaches deep into the internet\u2019s\ninfrastructure \u2014 the pipes and protocols, cables and networks, search engines\nand browsers. These structures determine how we build and use the internet,\nnow and in the future.\n\nThey\u2019ve concentrated into a series of near-planetary duopolies: For example,\nas of April 2024, Google and Apple\u2019s internet browsers have captured almost\n85% of the world market share, Microsoft and Apple\u2019s two desktop operating\nsystems over 80%. Google runs 84% of global search and Microsoft 3%. Slightly\nmore than half of all phones come from Apple and Samsung, while over 99% of\nmobile operating systems run on Google or Apple software.^ Two cloud computing\nproviders, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s Azure make up over 50% of the\nglobal market. Apple and Google\u2019s email clients manage nearly 90% of global\nemail. Google and Cloudflare serve around 50% of global domain name system\nrequests.\n\nTwo kinds of everything may be enough to fill a fictional ark and repopulate a\nruined world, but can\u2019t run an open, global \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d where\neveryone has the same chance to innovate and compete. No wonder internet\nengineer Leslie Daigle termed the concentration and consolidation of the\ninternet\u2019s technical architecture \u201c\u2018climate change\u2019 of the Internet\necosystem.\u201d\n\n## Walled Gardens Have Deep Roots\n\nThe internet made the tech giants possible. Their services have scaled\nglobally, via its open, interoperable core. But for the past decade, they\u2019ve\nalso worked to enclose the varied, competing and often open-source or\ncollectively provided services the internet is built on into their proprietary\ndomains. Although this improves their operational efficiency it also ensures\nthe flourishing conditions of their own emergence aren\u2019t repeated by potential\ncompetitors. For tech giants, the long period of open internet evolution is\nover. Their internet is not an ecosystem. It\u2019s a zoo.\n\nGoogle, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are consolidating their control deep into\nthe underlying infrastructure through acquisitions, vertical integration,\nbuilding proprietary networks, creating chokepoints and concentrating\nfunctions from different technical layers into a single silo of top-down\ncontrol. They can afford to, using the vast wealth reaped in their one-off\nharvest of collective, global wealth.\n\n\u201cOur online spaces are not ecosystems, though tech firms love that word.\nThey\u2019re plantations; highly concentrated and controlled environments ... that\nmadden the creatures trapped within.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nTaken together, the enclosure of infrastructure and imposition of technology\nmonoculture forecloses our futures. Internet people like to talk about \u201cthe\nstack,\u201d or the layered architecture of protocols, software and hardware,\noperated by different service providers that collectively delivers the daily\nmiracle of connection. It\u2019s a complicated, dynamic system with a basic value\nbaked into the core design; key functions are kept separate to ensure\nresilience, generality and create room for innovation.\n\nInitially funded by the U.S. military and designed by academic researchers to\nfunction in wartime, the internet evolved to work anywhere, in any condition,\noperated by anyone who wanted to connect. But what was a dynamic, ever-\nevolving game of Tetris with distinct \u201cplayers\u201d and \u201clayers\u201d is today\nhardening into a continent-spanning system of compacted tectonic plates.\nInfrastructure is not just what we see on the surface; it\u2019s the forces below,\nthat make mountains and power tsunamis. Whoever controls infrastructure\ndetermines the future. If you doubt that, consider that in Europe we\u2019re still\nusing the roads and living in many towns and cities the Roman Empire mapped\nout 2,000 years ago.\n\nIn 2019, some internet engineers in the global standards-setting body, the\nInternet Engineering Task Force (IETF), raised the alarm. Daigle, a respected\nengineer who had previously chaired its oversight committee and internet\narchitecture board, wrote in a policy brief that consolidation meant network\nstructures were ossifying throughout the stack, making incumbents harder to\ndislodge and violating a core principle of the internet: that it does not\ncreate \u201cpermanent favorites.\u201d Consolidation doesn\u2019t just squeeze out\ncompetition. It narrows the kinds of relationships possible between operators\nof different services.\n\nAs Daigle put it: \u201cThe more proprietary solutions are built and deployed\ninstead of collaborative open standards-based ones, the less the internet\nsurvives as a platform for future innovation.\u201d Consolidation kills\ncollaboration between service providers through the stack by rearranging an\narray of different relationships \u2014 competitive, collaborative \u2014 into a single\npredatory one.\n\nSince then, standards development organizations (SDOs) started several\ninitiatives to name and tackle infrastructure consolidation, but these\nfloundered. Bogged down in technical minutiae, unable to separate themselves\nfrom their employers\u2019 interests and deeply held professional values of\nsimplification and control, most internet engineers simply couldn\u2019t see the\nforest for the trees.\n\nUp close, internet concentration seems too intricate to untangle; from far\naway, it seems too difficult to deal with. But what if we thought of the\ninternet not as a doomsday \u201chyperobject,\u201d but as a damaged and struggling\necosystem facing destruction? What if we looked at it not with helpless horror\nat the eldritch encroachment of its current controllers, but with compassion,\nconstructiveness and hope?\n\nTechnologists are great at incremental fixes, but to regenerate entire\nhabitats we need to learn from ecologists who take a whole-systems view.\nEcologists know something just as important, too; how to keep going when\nothers first ignore you and then say it\u2019s too late, how to mobilize and work\ncollectively, and how to build pockets of diversity and resilience that will\noutlast them, creating possibilities for an abundant future they can imagine\nbut never control. We don\u2019t need to repair the internet\u2019s infrastructure. We\nneed to rewild it.\n\n## What Is Rewilding?\n\nRewilding \u201caims to restore healthy ecosystems by creating wild, biodiverse\nspaces,\u201d according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. More\nambitious and risk-tolerant than traditional conservation, it targets entire\necosystems to make space for complex food webs and the emergence of unexpected\ninterspecies relations. It\u2019s less interested in saving specific endangered\nspecies. Individual species are just ecosystem components, and focusing on\ncomponents loses sight of the whole. Ecosystems flourish through multiple\npoints of contact between their many elements, just like computer networks.\nAnd like in computer networks, ecosystem interactions are multifaceted and\ngenerative.\n\nRewilding has much to offer people who care about the internet. As Paul Jepson\nand Cain Blythe wrote in their book \u201cRewilding: The Radical New Science of\nEcological Recovery,\u201d rewilding pays attention \u201cto the emergent properties of\ninteractions between \u2018things\u2019 in ecosystems ... a move from linear to systems\nthinking.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fundamentally cheerful and workmanlike approach to what can seem\ninsoluble problems. It doesn\u2019t micromanage. It creates room for \u201cecological\nprocesses [which] foster complex and self-organizing ecosystems.\u201d Rewilding\nputs into practice what every good manager knows: hire the best people you\ncan, provide what they need to thrive, then get out of the way. It\u2019s the\nopposite of command-and-control.\n\n\u201cRewilding the internet is more than a metaphor. It\u2019s a framework and plan.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nRewilding the internet is more than a metaphor. It\u2019s a framework and plan. It\ngives us fresh eyes for the wicked problem of extraction and control, and new\nmeans and allies to fix it. It recognizes that ending internet monopolies\nisn\u2019t just an intellectual problem. It\u2019s an emotional one. It answers\nquestions like how do we keep going when the monopolies have more money and\npower? How do we act collectively when they suborn our community spaces,\nfunding and networks? And how do we communicate to our allies what fixing it\nwill look and feel like?\n\nRewilding is a positive vision for the networks we want to live inside, and a\nshared story for how we get there. It grafts a new tree onto technology\u2019s\ntired old stock. And embodied in rewilding\u2019s ecological tools is the\ncollective wisdom of an entire discipline already tackling humanity\u2019s\ntoughest, systemic problems.\n\n## What Ecology Knows\n\nEcology knows plenty about complex systems that technologists can benefit from\nlearning. First, it knows that shifting baselines are real.\n\nIf you were born around the 1970s, you probably remember many more dead\ninsects on the windscreen of your parents\u2019 car than on your own; global land-\ndwelling insect populations are dropping about 9% a decade. If you\u2019re a geek,\nyou probably programmed your own computer to make basic games. You certainly\nremember a web with more to read than the same five websites. You may have\neven written your own blog.\n\nBut many people born after 2000 probably think a world with few insects,\nlittle ambient noise from birdcalls, where you regularly use only a few social\nmedia and messaging apps (rather than a whole web) is normal. As Jepson and\nBlythe wrote, shifting baselines are \u201cwhere each generation assumes the nature\nthey experienced in their youth to be normal and unwittingly accepts the\ndeclines and damage of the generations before.\u201d Damage is already baked in. It\neven seems natural.\n\nEcology knows that shifting baselines dampen collective urgency and deepen\ngenerational divides. People who care about internet monoculture and control\nare often told they\u2019re nostalgists harkening back to a pioneer era. But it\u2019s\nfiendishly hard to regenerate an open and competitive infrastructure for\nyounger generations who\u2019ve been raised to assume that two or three platforms,\ntwo app stores, two operating systems, two browsers, one cloud/mega-store and\na single search engine for the world comprise the internet. If the internet\nfor you is the massive sky-scraping silo you happen to live inside and the\nonly thing you can see outside is the single, other massive sky-scraping silo,\nthen how can you imagine anything else?\n\nThe answer isn\u2019t to make everyone learn about how the original protocols were\ndesigned to separate key functions and the power that goes with them (though\nthat\u2019s certainly good to know). It\u2019s to change how we feel and react to living\ninside a complex system that needs our care. Tech toxicity stems from there\nbeing only one business model for how to internet: concentration,\nsurveillance, control. Further centralizing and managing this broken system\nwill only make it worse.\n\nRewilding the internet is not a nostalgia project for middle-aged nerds who\nmiss IRC and Usenet. For many people across the generations today, platforms\nlike Facebook or TikTok are the internet. They\u2019ve long dwelled in walled\ngardens they think are the world. Concentrated digital power produces the same\nsymptoms that command and control produces in biological ecosystems; acute\ndistress punctuated by sudden collapses once tipping points are reached.\nRewilding is a way to collectively see the counterintuitive truth; today\u2019s\ninternet isn\u2019t too wild, even if it feels like that. It\u2019s simply not wild\nenough.\n\nIt\u2019s important to share that ecological rewilding is a work in progress. What\ndo you rewild to? Humans have shaped and cultivated landscapes for tens of\nthousands of years, so what does \u201cwild\u201d even mean? Just as there\u2019s no\necosystem on Earth untouched by human actions, there\u2019s no \u201ctrue\u201d wildness to\nreturn habitats to. And what scale is needed for rewilding to succeed? It\u2019s\none thing to reintroduce wolves to the 3,472 square miles of Yellowstone,\nquite another to cordon off about 20 square miles of a reclaimed polder near\nAmsterdam. Large and diverse Yellowstone is likely complex enough to adapt to\nchange, but the small Dutch reserve known as Oostvaardersplassen has\nstruggled.\n\n\u201cFor tech giants, the long period of open internet evolution is over. Their\ninternet is not an ecosystem. It\u2019s a zoo.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nIn the 1980s, the Dutch government attempted to regenerate a section of the\novergrown Oostvaardersplassen. An independent-minded government ecologist,\nFrans Vera, said reeds and scrub would dominate unless now-extinct herbivores\ngrazed them. In place of ancient aurochs, the state forest management agency\nintroduced the famously bad-tempered German Heck cattle, and in place of an\nextinct steppe pony, a Polish semi-feral breed.\n\nSome 30 years on, with no natural predators, and after plans for a wildlife\ncorridor to another reserve came to nothing, there were many more animals than\nthe limited winter vegetation could sustain. People were horrified by starving\ncows and ponies, and beginning in 2018, government agencies instituted animal\nwelfare checks and culling or removals.\n\nJust turning the clock back was insufficient. The segment of\nOostvaardersplassen was too small and too disconnected to be rewilded. Its\neffectively landlocked status made over-grazing and collapse inevitable, an\nembarrassing but necessary lesson. Rewilding is a work in progress. It\u2019s not\nabout trying to revert ecosystems to a mythical Eden. Instead, rewilders seek\nto rebuild resilience by restoring autonomous natural processes and letting\nthem operate at scale to generate complexity. But rewilding, itself a human\nintervention, can take several turns to get right.\n\nWhatever we do, the internet isn\u2019t returning to old-school then-common\ninterfaces like FTP and Gopher, or each organization running its own mail\nserver, rather than operating off G-Suite. But shifting baselines mean that\neveryone using it today needs a shared way to articulate what\u2019s happening, and\na collective sense of purpose and possibility.\n\nSome of what we need is already here, especially on the web. Look at the\nresurgence of RSS feeds, email newsletters and blogs as we discover (yet\nagain) that relying on one app to host global conversations creates a single\npoint of failure and control. New systems are growing, like the Fediverse with\nits federated islands, or Bluesky with algorithmic choice and composable\nmoderation.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what the future holds. Our job is to keep open as much\nopportunity as we can, trusting that those who come later will use it.\nRewilding gets this. Instead of setting purity tests for which kind of\ninternet is most like the original, we can test changes against the values of\nthe original design. Do new standards protect the network\u2019s \u201cgenerality,\u201d i.e.\nits ability to support multiple uses, or is functionality limited to optimize\nefficiency for the biggest tech firms? The internet is the technological\nexpression of hard-won human wisdom; general-purpose systems are the most\nresilient, and it\u2019s risky to concentrate information and control.\n\nEcologists also know that complexity is not the enemy, it\u2019s the goal. The\nstory of scientific forestry shows the conflict isn\u2019t just between duopoly\nplatforms and everyone else; it\u2019s between a brittle, command-and-control\nmentality, and the ability to have faith in complex systems that may produce\nthings you didn\u2019t foresee for people you don\u2019t control.\n\nAs early as 1985, plant ecologists Steward T.A. Pickett and Peter S. White\nwrote in \u201cThe Ecology of Natural Disturbance and Patch Dynamics,\u201d that \u201c[an]\nessential paradox of wilderness conservation is that we seek to preserve what\nmust change.\u201d Some internet engineers know this. David Clark, a Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology professor who worked on some of the internet\u2019s\nearliest protocols, wrote an entire book about other network architectures\nthat might have been built, if different values, like security or centralized\nmanagement, had been prioritized by the internet\u2019s creators.\n\nBut our internet took off because it was designed as a general-purpose\nnetwork, built to connect anyone. Our internet was built to be complex and\nunbiddable, to do things we cannot yet imagine. When we interviewed Clark for\nrewilding project, he told us that \u201c\u2018complex\u2019 implies a system in which you\nhave emergent behavior, a system in which you can\u2019t model the outcomes. Your\nintuitions may be wrong. But a system that\u2019s too simple means lost\nopportunities.\u201d^ Or, as Daigle wrote in that 2019 policy brief, \u201csimplicity is\nnot always the best outcome.\u201d Everything worthwhile we collectively make is\ncomplex or, honestly, messy. The cracks are where new people and ideas get in.\n\nInternet infrastructure is a degraded ecosystem, but it\u2019s also a built\nenvironment, like a city. Its complexity and unpredictability make it\ngenerative, worthwhile and deeply human. In 1961, Jane Jacobs, an American-\nCanadian activist and author of \u201cThe Death and Life of Great American Cities,\u201d\nargued that mixed-use neighborhoods were safer, happier, more prosperous, and\nmore livable than the sterile, highly controlling designs of urban planners\nlike New York\u2019s Robert Moses.\n\n\u201cCrashes, fires and floods may simply be entropy in action, but systemically\nconcentrated and risky infrastructures are choices made manifest \u2014 and we can\nmake better ones.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nBoth Jacobs and the anthropologist Scott showed that top-down planning is\noften disastrous because instead of setting the stage for generative\ninteractions it tries to control what people will do. Just like the crime-\nridden, Corbusier-like towers Moses crammed people into when he demolished\nmixed-use neighborhoods and built highways through them, today\u2019s top-down,\nconcentrated internet is, for many, an unpleasant and harmful place. Its\nowners are hard to remove, and their interests do not align with ours.\n\nAs Jacobs wrote: \u201cAs in all Utopias, the right to have plans of any\nsignificance belonged only to the planners in charge.\u201d^ As a top-down, built\nenvironment, the internet has become something that is done to us, not\nsomething we collectively remake every day.\n\nIn an ecosystem, everything is infrastructure for everything else. Ecosystems\nendure because species serve as checks and balances on each other. They have\ndifferent modes of interaction, not just extraction, but mutualism,\ncommensalism, competition and predation. In flourishing ecosystems, predators\nare subject to limits. They\u2019re just one part of a complex web that passes\ncalories around, not a one-way ticket to the end of evolution.\n\nEcologists know that diversity is resilience.\n\nOn July 18, 2001, 11 carriages of a 60-car freight train derailed in the\nHoward Street Tunnel under Mid-Town Belvedere, a neighborhood just north of\ndowntown Baltimore. Within minutes one carriage containing a highly flammable\nchemical was punctured. The escaping chemical ignited and soon adjacent\ncarriages were alight in a fire that took about five days to put out. The\ndisaster multiplied and spread. Thick, brick tunnel walls acted like an oven,\nand temperatures rose to nearly 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. A more than three-\nfoot-wide water main above the tunnels burst, flooding the tunnel with\nmillions of gallons within hours. It only cooled a little. Three weeks later,\nan explosion linked to the combustible chemical blew out manhole covers\nlocated as far as two miles away.\n\nWorldCom, then the second largest long-distance phone company in the U.S., had\nfiber-optic cables in the tunnel carrying high volumes of phone and internet\ntraffic. However, according to Clark, WorldCom\u2019s resilience planning meant\ntraffic was spread over different fiber networks in anticipation of just this\nkind of event.\n\nOn paper, Worldcom had network redundancy. But almost immediately, U.S.\ninternet traffic slowed, and WorldCom\u2019s East Coast and transatlantic phone\nlines went down. The region\u2019s narrow physical topography had concentrated all\nthose different fiber networks into a single chokepoint, the Howard Street\nTunnel. WorldCom\u2019s resilience was, quite literally, incinerated. It had\ntechnological redundancy, but not diversity. Sometimes we don\u2019t notice\nconcentration until it\u2019s too late.\n\nRead Noema in print.\n\nClark tells the story of the Howard Street Tunnel fire to show that\nbottlenecks aren\u2019t always obvious, especially at the operational level, and\nhuge systems that seem secure due to their size and resources, can\nunexpectedly crumble.\n\nIn today\u2019s internet, much traffic passes through tech firms\u2019 private networks,\nfor example, Google and Meta\u2019s own undersea cables. Much internet traffic is\nserved from a few dominant content distribution networks, like Cloudflare and\nAkamai, who run their own networks of proxy servers and data centers.\nSimilarly, that traffic goes through an increasingly small number of domain\nname system (DNS) resolvers, which work like phone books for the internet,\nlinking website names to their numeric address.\n\nAll of this improves network speed and efficiency but creates new and non-\nobvious bottlenecks like the Howard Street Tunnel. Centralized service\nproviders say they\u2019re better resourced and skilled at attacks and failures,\nbut they are also large, attractive targets for attackers and possible single\npoints of system failure.\n\nOn Oct. 21, 2016, dozens of major U.S. websites suddenly stopped working.\nDomain names belonging to Airbnb, Amazon, PayPal, CNN, The New York Times\nsimply didn\u2019t resolve. All were clients of the commercial DNS service\nprovider, Dyn, which had been hit by a cyberattack. Hackers infected tens of\nthousands of internet-enabled devices with malicious software, creating a\nnetwork of hijacked devices, or a botnet, that they used to bombard Dyn with\nqueries until it collapsed. America\u2019s biggest internet brands were brought\ndown, essentially, by a network of baby monitors. Although they all likely had\nresilience planning and redundancies, they went down because a single\nchokepoint \u2014 in one crucial layer of infrastructure \u2014 failed.\n\nConsolidation drives fragility. It imposes narrowness. Arranging deliberately\nvaried networks and services into centralized stovepipes means we repeatedly\nfail to think of the internet as a complex system. Just like the train crash\nthat caused a chemical leak that resulted in burst water pipes, melted fiber-\noptic cables and blown up manholes, single points of failure in complex\ncritical systems have wide, unpredictable and devastating effects.\n\n\u201cJust imagine what the future possibilities for internet innovation could be\nif \u201ccapitalism without competition\u201d was rooted out all the way up and down the\nstack.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nWidespread outages due to centralized chokepoints have become so common that\ninvestors even use them to identify opportunities. When a failure by cloud\nprovider Fastly took high-profile websites offline in 2021, its share price\nsurged. Investors were delighted by headlines that informed them of an obscure\ntechnical service provider with an apparent lock on an essential service.^ To\ninvestors, this critical infrastructure failure doesn\u2019t look like fragility\nbut like a chance to profit.\n\nThe result of infrastructural narrowness is baked-in fragility that we only\nnotice after a breakdown. But monoculture is also highly visible in our search\nand browser tools. Search, browsing and social media are how we find and share\nknowledge, and how we communicate. They\u2019re a critical, global epistemic and\ndemocratic infrastructure, controlled by just a few U.S. companies. Crashes,\nfires and floods may simply be entropy in action, but systemically\nconcentrated and risky infrastructures are choices made manifest \u2014 and we can\nmake better ones.\n\n## The Look & Feel Of A Rewilded Internet\n\nA rewilded internet will have many more service choices. Some services like\nsearch and social media will be broken up, as AT&T eventually was. Instead of\ntech firms extracting and selling people\u2019s personal data, different payment\nmodels will fund the infrastructure we need. Right now, there is little\nexplicit provision for public goods like protocols and browsers, essential to\nmaking the internet work. The biggest tech firms subsidize and profoundly\ninfluence them.\n\nPart of rewilding means taking what\u2019s been pulled inside the big tech stack\nout of it, and paying for the true costs of connectivity. Some things like\nbasic connectivity we will continue to pay for directly, and others like\nbrowsers we will support indirectly but transparently, as described below. The\nrewilded internet will have an abundance of ways to connect and relate to each\nother. There won\u2019t be just one or two numbers to call if leaders of a\npolitical coup decide to shut the internet down in the middle of the night, as\nhas happened in places like Egypt and Myanmar. No one entity will permanently\nbe on top. A rewilded internet will be a more interesting, usable, stable and\nenjoyable place to be.\n\nThrough extensive research, Nobel-winning economist Elinor Ostrom found that\n\u201cwhen individuals are well informed about the problem they face and about who\nelse is involved, and can build settings where trust and reciprocity can\nemerge, grow, and be sustained over time, costly and positive actions are\nfrequently taken without waiting for an external authority to impose rules,\nmonitor compliance, and assess penalties.\u201d Ostrom found people spontaneously\norganizing to manage natural resources \u2014 from water company cooperation in\nCalifornia to Maine lobster fishermen monitoring each other and repelling\noutsiders to prevent over-fishing.\n\nSelf-organization also exists as part of a key internet function: traffic\ncoordination. Internet exchange points (IXPs) are an example of common-pool\nresource management, where internet service providers (ISPs) collectively\nagree to carry each other\u2019s data for low or no cost. Network operators of all\nkinds \u2014 telecoms companies, large tech firms, universities, governments and\nbroadcasters \u2014 all need to send large amounts of data through other ISPs\u2019\nnetworks so that it gets to its destination.\n\nIf they managed this separately through individual contracts, they\u2019d spend\nmuch more time and money. Instead, they often form IXPs, typically as\nindependent, not-for-profit associations. As well as managing traffic, IXPs\nhave, in many \u2014 and especially developing \u2014 countries, formed the backbone of\na flourishing technical community that further drives economic development.\n\nBoth between people and on the internet, connections are generative. From\ntechnical standards to common-pool resource management and even to more\nlocalized broadband networks known as \u201caltnets,\u201d internet rewilding already\nhas a deep toolbox of collective action ready to be deployed.\n\n## The Road To Rewilding\n\nThe list of infrastructures to be diversified is long; as well as pipes and\nprotocols, there are operating systems, browsers, search engines, DNS, social\nmedia, advertising, cloud providers, app stores, AI companies and more. Not\nonly are the technologies involved complex, but they\u2019re also intertwined. But\nfreedoms are additive. Showing what can be done in one area creates\nopportunities in others. First, let\u2019s start with regulation.\n\n## The New Drive For Antitrust & Competition\n\nYou don\u2019t always need a big new idea like rewilding to frame and motivate\nmajor structural change. Sometimes reviving an old idea will do. President\nBiden\u2019s 2021 \u201cExecutive Order on Promoting Competition in the American\nEconomy\u201d revived the original, pro-worker, trust-busting scope and urgency of\nthe early 20th-century legal activist and Supreme Court Justice Louis D.\nBrandeis, along with rules and framings that date back to before the 1930s New\nDeal.\n\n\u201cRewilding an already built environment isn\u2019t just sitting back and seeing\nwhat tender, living thing can force its way through the concrete. It\u2019s razing\nto the ground the structures that block out light for everyone not rich enough\nto live on the top floor.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nU.S. antitrust law was created to break the power of oligarchs in oil, steel\nand railroads who threatened America\u2019s young democracy. It gave workers basic\nprotections and saw equal economic opportunity as essential to freedom. This\nexpansive and interdependent view of competition and antitrust as essential\nfor fairness and democracy was whittled away by Chicago School economists\u2019\npolicies in the 1970s and Regan-era judges\u2019 court rulings over the decades and\nsidelined by the narrow economic doctrine that intervention is only permitted\nwhen monopoly power causes consumer prices to rise. The intellectual\nmonoculture of the consumer harm threshold has since spread globally.\n\nIt\u2019s why governments just stood aside as 21st-century tech firms romped to\noligopoly. If a regulator\u2019s sole criterion for action is to make sure\nconsumers don\u2019t pay a penny more, then the free or data-subsidized services of\ntech platforms don\u2019t even register. (Of course, consumers pay in other ways,\nas these tech giants exploit their personal information for profit.) This\nlaissez-faire approach allowed the biggest firms to choke off competition by\nacquiring their competitors and vertically integrating service providers,\ncreating the problems we have today.\n\nRegulators and enforcers in Washington and Brussels now say they have learned\nthat lesson and won\u2019t allow AI dominance to happen as internet concentration\ndid. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan and U.S. Department of Justice\nantitrust enforcer, Jonathan Kanter, are identifying chokepoints in the AI\n\u201cstack\u201d \u2014 concentration in control of processing chips, datasets, computing\ncapacity, algorithm innovation, distribution platforms and user interfaces \u2014\nand analyzing each potential bottleneck to see if it affects systemic\ncompetition. This is potentially good news for people who want to prevent the\ncurrent dominance of tech giants being grandfathered into our AI future.\n\nIn his 2021 signing of the executive order on competition, President Biden\nsaid, \u201ccapitalism without competition isn\u2019t capitalism; it\u2019s exploitation.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s enforcers are changing the kinds of cases they take up and widening\nthe applicable legal theories on harm that they bring to judges. Instead of\nthe traditionally narrow focus on consumer prices, today\u2019s cases argue that\nthe economic harms perpetrated by dominant firms include those suffered by\ntheir workers, small companies and the market as a whole.\n\nKhan and Kanter have jettisoned narrow and abstruse models of market behavior\nfor real-world experiences of healthcare workers, farmers, writers. They get\nthat shutting off economic opportunity fuels far-right extremism. They\u2019ve made\nantitrust enforcement and competition policy explicitly about coercion versus\nchoice, power versus democracy. Kanter told a recent conference in Brussels\nthat \u201cexcessive concentration of power is a threat ... it\u2019s not just about\nprices or output but it\u2019s about freedom, liberty and opportunity.\u201d\n\nEnforcers in Washington and Brussels are starting to preemptively block tech\nfirms from using dominance in one realm to take over another. After scrutiny\nby the U.S. FTC and European Commission, Amazon recently abandoned its plan to\nacquire the home appliance manufacturer, iRobot. Regulators on both sides of\nthe Atlantic have also moved to stop Apple from using its iPhone platform\ndominance to squeeze app store competition and dominate future markets\nthrough, for example, pushing the usage of CarPlay on automakers and limiting\naccess to its tap-to-pay digital wallet in the financial services sector.\n\nStill, so far, their enforcement actions have focused on the consumer-facing,\nhighly visible parts of the tech giants\u2019 exploitative and proprietary\ninternet. The few, narrow measures of the 2021 executive order that aim to\nreduce infrastructure-based monopolies, only prevent future abuses like radio\nspectrum-hogging, not those already locked in. Sure, the best way to deal with\nmonopolies is to stop them from happening in the first place. But unless\nregulators and enforcers eradicate the existing dominance of these giants now,\nwe\u2019ll be living in today\u2019s infrastructure monopoly for decades, perhaps even a\ncentury.\n\nJust imagine applying Khan and Kanter\u2019s chokepoint identification and whole-\nsystem harms investigation to the internet\u2019s invisible layers \u2014 and doing so\ntoday. Just imagine what the future possibilities for internet innovation\ncould be if \u201ccapitalism without competition\u201d was rooted out all the way up and\ndown the stack.\n\nThe recent return to more muscular competition enforcement still isn\u2019t radical\nenough. So far, even activist regulators have shied away from applying the\ntoughest remedies for concentration in long-consolidated markets, such as non-\ndiscrimination requirements, functional interoperability and structural\nseparations, i.e. breaking companies up. And talk of declaring the so-called\n\u201cnatural monopolies\u201d in search and social media to be public utilities \u2014 and\nforcing them to act as common carriers open to all \u2014 is still too extreme for\nmost.\n\nBut taken together, these are some of the most powerful tools we have to\nrewild the internet\u2019s silent and existing vertical integrations; its\ndeliberately moated fiefdoms squatting on bottlenecks of critical national and\nglobal infrastructure. Rewilding an already built environment isn\u2019t just\nsitting back and seeing what tender, living thing can force its way through\nthe concrete. It\u2019s razing to the ground the structures that block out light\nfor everyone not rich enough to live on the top floor.\n\n\u201cRegulators\u2019 efforts to make the visible internet competitive will achieve\nlittle unless they also tackle the devastation that lies beneath.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nWhen the writer and activist Cory Doctorow wrote about how to free ourselves\nfrom the clutches of Big Tech, he said that though breaking up big companies\nwill likely take decades, providing strong and mandatory interoperability\nwould open up innovative space and slow the flow of money to the largest firms\n\u2014 money they would otherwise use to deepen their moats.\n\nDoctorow describes \u201ccomcom,\u201d or competitive compatibility, as a kind of\n\u201cguerrilla interoperability, achieved through reverse engineering, bots,\nscraping and other permissionless tactics.\u201d Before a thicket of invasive laws\nsprung up to strangle it, comcom was just how people figured out how to fix\ncars and tractors or re-write software. Comcom drives the try-every-tactic-\nuntil-one-works behavior you see in a flourishing ecosystem.\n\nIn an ecosystem, diversity of species is another way of saying \u201cdiversity of\ntactics,\u201d as each successful new tactic creates a new niche to occupy. Whether\nit\u2019s an octopus camouflaging itself as a sea snake, a cuckoo smuggling her\nchicks into another bird\u2019s nest, orchids producing flowers that look just like\na female bee, or parasites influencing rodent hosts to take life-ending risks,\neach evolutionary micro-niche is created by a successful tactic. Comcom is\nsimply tactical diversity; it\u2019s how organisms interact in complex, dynamic\nsystems. And humans have demonstrated the epitome of short-term thinking by\nenabling the oligarchs who are trying to end it.\n\nEfforts are underway. The EU already has several years of experience with\ninteroperability mandates and precious insight into how determined firms work\nto circumvent such laws. The U.S., however, is still in its early days of\nensuring software interoperability, for example, for videoconferencing.\u201d\n\nPerhaps one way to motivate and encourage regulators and enforcers everywhere\nis to explain that the subterranean architecture of the internet has become a\nshadowland where evolution has all but stopped. Regulators\u2019 efforts to make\nthe visible internet competitive will achieve little unless they also tackle\nthe devastation that lies beneath.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nMuch of what we need is already here. Beyond regulators digging deep for\ncourage, vision and bold new litigation strategies, we need vigorous, pro-\ncompetitive government policies around procurement, investments and physical\ninfrastructure, that require interoperability at every level and the resources\nto make it happen. Universities must reject research funding from tech firms\nbecause it always comes with conditions, both spoken and unspoken.\n\nInstead, we need more public-funded tech research with publicly released\nfindings aimed at serving the collective good. Such research should\ninvestigate power concentration in the internet ecosystem and practical\nalternatives to it. We need to recognize that much of the internet\u2019s\ninfrastructure is a de facto utility, that any monopolies are critical public\nresources that we must regain control of.\n\nWe must ensure regulatory and financial incentives and support for\nalternatives including common-pool resource management, community networks,\nand the myriad other collaborative mechanisms people have always used to\nprovide essential public goods like clean water, roads and defense.\n\nAll this takes money. Governments are starved of tax revenue by the once-in-\nhistory windfalls seized by today\u2019s tech giants, so it\u2019s clear where the money\nis. We need to get it back. We need to stop talking about ethics and hoping\nthe next generation will do a better job and start making demands of power.\n\nWe know all this, but still find it so hard to collectively act. Why?\n\nHerded into rigid tech plantations rather than functioning, diverse\necosystems, it\u2019s tough to imagine alternatives. Even those who can see clearly\nmay feel helpless and alone. Rewilding unites everything we know we need to do\nand brings with it a whole new toolbox and vision.\n\nEcologists face the same systems of exploitation and are organizing urgently,\nat scale and across domains. They see clearly that the issues aren\u2019t isolated\nbut are instances of the same pathology of command and control, extraction and\ndomination that political anthropologist Scott first noticed in scientific\nforestry. The solutions are the same in ecology and technology; aggressively\nuse the rule of law to level out unequal capital and power, then rush in to\nfill the gaps with better ways of doing things.\n\n## Keep The Internet, The Internet\n\nSusan Leigh Star, a sociologist and theorist of infrastructure and networks,\nwrote in her 1999 influential paper, \u201cThe Ethnography of Infrastructure\u201d:\n\n\u201cStudy a city and neglect its sewers and power supplies (as many have), and\nyou miss essential aspects of distributional justice and planning power. Study\nan information system and neglect its standards, wires, and settings, and you\nmiss equally essential aspects of aesthetics, justice, and change.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf fundamental internet protocols don\u2019t maximize the values of\ninteroperability, generality and openness, then they\u2019re simply not the\ninternet.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nThe technical protocols and standards that underlie the internet\u2019s\ninfrastructure are ostensibly developed in open, collaborative SDOs, but are\nalso increasingly under the control of a few companies; so what appear to be\n\u201cvoluntary\u201d standards are often the business choices of the biggest firms.\n\nThe dominance of SDOs by big firms also shapes what does not get standardized\n\u2014 for example, search, which is effectively a global monopoly. While efforts\nto directly address internet consolidation have been raised repeatedly within\nSDOs, little progress has been made. This is damaging SDOs\u2019 credibility,\nespecially outside the U.S. SDOs must radically change or they will lose their\nimplicit global mandate to steward the future of the internet.\n\nWe need internet standards to be global, open and generative. They\u2019re the wire\nmodels that give the internet its planetary form, the gossamer-thin but\nsteely-strong threads holding together its interoperability against\nfragmentation and permanent dominance. We need them to work. As internet\nengineer Jari Arkko put it in 2020, for the health of the network and all our\nsecurity, SDOs must \u201censure that key aspects of the evolving internet stay\nopen, e.g. through open, standardized interfaces and that open source\ncontinues to be an important building block.\u201d If fundamental internet\nprotocols don\u2019t maximize the values of interoperability, generality and\nopenness, then they\u2019re simply not the internet.\n\n## Make Laws & Standards Work Together\n\nIn 2018, a small group of Californians maneuvered the California Legislature\ninto passing the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Nested in the statute\nwas an unassuming provision, the \u201cright to opt out of sale or sharing\u201d your\npersonal information via a \u201cuser-enabled global privacy control\u201d or GPC signal\nthat would create an automated method for doing so. The law didn\u2019t define how\nGPC might work. As a technical standard was required for browsers, businesses\nand providers to speak the same language, the signal\u2019s details were delegated\nto a group of experts.\n\nIn July 2021, California\u2019s Attorney General mandated that all businesses use\nthe newly created GPC for California-based consumers visiting their websites.\nThe group of experts is now shepherding the technical specification through\nglobal web standards development at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). For\nCalifornia residents, GPC automates the request to \u201caccept\u201d or \u201creject\u201d sales\nof your data, such as cookie-based tracking, on its websites; however, it\nisn\u2019t yet supported by major default browsers like Chrome and Safari. Broad\nadoption will take time, but it\u2019s a small step in changing real-world outcomes\nby driving antimonopoly practices deep into the standards stack \u2014 and it\u2019s\nalready being adopted elsewhere.\n\nGPC is not the first legally mandated open standard, but it was deliberately\ndesigned from day one to bridge policymaking and standards-setting. The\nstandard provides a mechanism and the law makes it mandatory. It\u2019s a powerful\ndynamic where all play to their strengths. The idea is gaining ground. A\nrecent United Nations Human Rights Council report recommends that states\ndelegate \u201cregulatory functions to standard-setting organizations.\u201d Our\ntechnical standards can be crossbred with institutions to produce protocols\nfor governance that let people shape their online world.\n\n## Make Service-Providers \u2014 Not Users \u2014 Transparent\n\nToday\u2019s internet offers minimal transparency of key internet infrastructure\nproviders. For example, browsers are highly complex pieces of infrastructure\nthat determine how billions of people use the web, yet they are provided for\nfree. That\u2019s because the most commonly used search engines enter into opaque\nfinancial deals with browsers, paying them to be set as the default. Since few\npeople change their default search engine, browsers like Safari and Firefox\nmake money by defaulting the search bar to Google, locking in its dominance\neven as the search engine\u2019s quality of output declines.\n\nThis creates a quandary. If antitrust enforcers were to impose competition,\nbrowsers would lose their main source of income. Infrastructure requires\nmoney, but the planetary nature of the internet challenges our public funding\nmodel, leaving the door open to private capture. However, if we see the\ncurrent opaque system as what it is, a kind of non-state taxation, then we can\ncraft an alternative.\n\nSearch engines are a logical place for governments to mandate the collection\nof a levy that supports browsers and other key internet infrastructure, which\ncould be financed transparently, under open, transnational, multistakeholder\noversight. Imagining new institutional methods to solve old problems at a\nglobal scale is one way to rewild the web.\n\n\u201cOur technical standards can be crossbred with institutions to produce\nprotocols for governance that let people shape their online world.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\n## Make Space To Grow\n\nWe need to stop thinking of internet infrastructure as too hard to fix. It\u2019s\nthe underlying system we use for nearly everything we do. The former prime\nminister of Sweden, Carl Bildt, and former Canadian deputy foreign minister,\nGordon Smith wrote in 2016 that the internet was becoming \u201cthe infrastructure\nof all infrastructure.\u201d^ It\u2019s how we organize, connect and build knowledge,\neven \u2014 perhaps \u2014 planetary intelligence. Right now, it\u2019s concentrated, fragile\nand utterly toxic.\n\nEcologists have re-oriented their field as a \u201ccrisis discipline,\u201d a field of\nstudy that\u2019s not just about learning things but about saving them. We\ntechnologists need to do the same. Rewilding the internet connects and grows\nwhat people are doing across regulation, standards-setting and new ways of\norganizing and building infrastructure, to tell a shared story of where we\nwant to go. It\u2019s a shared vision with many strategies. The instruments we need\nto shift away from extractive technological monocultures are at hand or ready\nto be built.\n\nJust as a diverse \u201cpocket forest\u201d is the surest way to regenerate urban\nvegetation, a global network with multiple different ways \u201cto internet\u201d is the\nbest insurance policy for future innovation and resilience. We need to rewild\nthe internet for the future, for our freedom to build tools and spaces, and to\nshare knowledge, ideas and stories that haven\u2019t been anticipated by the\ninternet\u2019s current overlords and cannot be contained.\n\nEnjoy the read?
