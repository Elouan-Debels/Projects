Leaders in the space,\nlike OpenAI, are beginning to intervene.\n\nAlexandra S.

Of those 36.2 million, NCMEC determined almost\n5,000 to be the result of generative AI, though it says the actual count is\nlikely considerably higher.\n\n\u201cIt's fairly small volume when considering the overall total of the\nCyberTipline reports, but our concern is that we're going to continue to see\nthat grow, especially as companies get better at detecting and reporting,\u201d\nFallon McNulty, director of the CyberTipline at NCMEC, told Forbes.\n\n\u201cWhat is really scary for us is, if we think about just the scale: It's so\nsmall and already has made such a huge impact,\u201d she added.\n\nOver the past year, there has been a pronounced uptick in reports of AI image\ngenerators being used to create illegal sexual abuse images. Deepfake nude\nphotos of students are roiling middle and high schools across the United\nStates. Some of the most popular new AI tools on the market have used illegal\nCSAM to train their models. And prosecutors recently charged a man in one of\nthe first criminal cases involving AI-generated CSAM.\n\n> \u201cThe scale of this could explode.\u201d\n\nRecently, a small-but-growing group of generative AI shops have begun to\ncooperate with NCMEC to track and flag apparent CSAM, McNulty said. Leading\nthe charge is OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT and text-to-image generator Dall-e,\nwhich started engaging with NCMEC last year and is now appearing in its report\nfor the first time. Anthropic and Stability AI have also joined the effort,\nMcNulty added, which is starting to paint a clearer picture of how most of\nthis content is being made\u2014whether by inputting text prompts, for example, or\nby using AI to manipulate photos of children or known CSAM. Although the\nbiggest social media apps are being used to spread it (and roughly 70 percent\nof tips related to AI CSAM were submitted by mainstream platforms), ground\nzero is often open source models or off-platform, McNulty said. Some reports\nthat NCMEC has received from social media companies include posts, comments,\nhashtags or chat logs detailing what AI model had been used.\n\nWith AI developing so rapidly and proliferating so quickly, McNulty said she\nfears \u201cthe scale of this could explode\u201d\u2014further inundating a disperse law\nenforcement system already struggling to keep up. That it is becoming\nincreasingly difficult to distinguish fake AI-generated CSAM from the real\nthing is another challenge. And although a handful of big generative AI\nplayers have agreed to work with NCMEC, some of the smaller platforms often\nreported to the organization\u2014 like apps that can \u201cnudify\u201d a photo, for\nexample\u2014have not, McNulty noted.\n\nThe trend continues\u2014in the first quarter of 2024, NCMEC has seen roughly 450\nreports a month of CSAM stemming from AI\u2014and is only expected to grow.\n\n### MORE FROM FORBES\n\nMORE FROM FORBESStable Diffusion 1.5 Was Trained On Illegal Child Sexual Abuse\nMaterial, Stanford Study SaysBy Alexandra S.
