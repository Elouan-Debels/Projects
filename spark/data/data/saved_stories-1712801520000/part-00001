The applications are flagged by Microsoft in an 'appraiser.sdb' file,\nwhich Windows Updater checks before updating your operating system software.\nIf you have an application installed on your machine that is on the\nappraiser.sdb file blacklist, Microsoft will prevent your system from\ninstalling the Windows update.\n\nThe full list of flagged apps has been uncovered by German website DeskModder\n(via XDA-Developers), and it includes several software development tools,\nAMD's Radeon software for optimizing GPU settings, an Intel audio software,\nand RealTek drivers. Microsoft has even flagged two Microsoft applications on\nthe appraiser.sdb blacklist.\n\n### Which apps are flagged?\n\n  * ConisioAdmin.exe (Solidworks PDM)\n  * EaseUS Disk Copy.exe (EaseUS Disk Copy Application)\n  * ep_dwm.exe (ExplorerPatcher)\n  * iCloudServices.exe (iCloud files shared in Explorer via WhatsApp)\n  * RadeonSoftware.exe (AMD GPU perf settings)\n  * StartAllBackCfg.exe (StartAllBack)\n  * Multi-mon + Copilot (Microsoft)\n  * MergeSdb (Microsoft)\n  * Intel IntcOED.sys (Intel)\n  * Intel IntcAudioBus.sys (Intel) (%WinDir%\\System32\\drivers\\IntcAudioBus.sys)\n  * Realtek 8192su Wireless USB 2.0 Adapter (Realtek (%WinDir%\\System32\\drivers\\RTL8192su.sys)\n\nObviously this can be a major problem, as GPU software and audio drivers can\nbe pre-installed on your machine and are often essential to keeping your\nlaptop or desktop running smoothly. But going without Windows 11 updates can\nput your system at a higher risk for malware and other security threats.\n\nWe've compiled a list of tricks to circumvent the Windows 'appraiser.sdb'\nblacklist. Any workaround does come with the usual caveats that Microsoft has\nlikely flagged these applications for a reason, so you may be circumventing\nsecurity protocols by using these solutions.\n\nLatest Videos from laptopmag\n\nIf you try to uninstall the flagged software, update your operating system,\nand reinstall the software Microsoft will prevent you from reinstalling the\nsoftware. So if you need one or more of the apps listed above, you'll need to\nmake a few adjustments.\n\n### How to stop Windows from blocking your software updates\n\nIf you do choose to go for a quicker fix for the Windows Updater block, this\nworkaround takes only a few steps to get you back on track.\n\n  * Uninstall the software\n  * Update Windows 11\n  * Download the software\n  * Before installing, change the name of the installer executable file which is typicall something like softwarename.exe and can be found in your downloads folder\n  * Install the software from the renamed .exe file\n\nIt is possible Microsoft will patch out this fix, so it may not be a reliable\nworkaround. But for now it seems to be working.\n\n## Stay in the know with Laptop Mag\n\nGet our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news\nstories delivered to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n### MORE FROM LAPTOP MAG\n\n  * Laptop Mag\u2019s Ultimate Home Office Awards\n  * Best laptop 2024: 10 best laptops tested and rated\n  * Best business laptops 2024: Top picks for office or remote work\n\nCategory\n\nBack to Laptops\n\nBrand\n\nProcessor\n\nRAM\n\nStorage Size\n\nScreen Size\n\nColour\n\nScreen Type\n\nStorage Type\n\nCondition\n\nPrice\n\nAny Price\n\nShowing 10 of 264 deals\n\nFilters\u2630\n\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M3 (2023)\n\n(512GB Silver)\n\nOur Review\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\n1\n\n\u00a31,699\n\n\u00a31,519.99\n\nView\n\nLenovo Yoga 9i Gen 8\n\n(1TB 32GB RAM)\n\n2\n\n\u00a32,299\n\n\u00a32,047\n\nView\n\nAsus Zenbook S 13 OLED\n\n(13.3-inch 512GB)\n\n3\n\n\u00a3999.99\n\nView\n\nAcer Chromebook Spin 714 (2023)\n\n(14-inch 512GB)\n\n4\n\n\u00a3799\n\n\u00a3699\n\nView\n\nAcer Swift 14\n\n(8GB RAM AMD Ryzen 5)\n\n5\n\n\u00a3699\n\nView\n\nDell XPS 15 9530\n\n6\n\n\u00a31,258.99\n\nView\n\nAsus ROG Strix Scar 18\n\n(Intel Core i9)\n\nOur Review\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\n7\n\n\u00a33,499.99\n\nView\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 11)\n\n(Black)\n\nOur Review\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\n8\n\n\u00a31,750\n\nView\n\nAsus ROG Strix Scar 18\n\nOur Review\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\n9\n\n\u00a33,999.99\n\nView\n\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M3 (2023)\n\nOur Review\n\n\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\n10\n\n\u00a31,593.32\n\nView\n\nLoad more deals\n\nMadeline Ricchiuto\n\nStaff Writer\n\nA former lab gremlin for Tom's Guide, Laptop Mag, Tom's Hardware, and Tech\nRadar; Madeline has escaped the labs to join Laptop Mag as a Staff Writer.\nWith over a decade of experience writing about tech and gaming, she may\nactually know a thing or two.
