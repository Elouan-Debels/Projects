Inside the fall of the popular chain\n\nShoppers make their way into a 99 Cents Only store in Santa Monica last\nFriday. All of the discount chain\u2019s 371 stores are closing.\n\n(Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBy Andrea Chang\n\nand Laurence Darmiento\n\nApril 10, 2024 3 AM PT\n\nFor Subscribers\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Show more sharing options\n\nShare\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Email\n  * Copy Link URLCopied!\n  * Print\n\nIt was Friday the 13th when the first 99 Cents Only store opened in 1982 on La\nTijera Boulevard.\n\nTo commemorate the grand opening, founder David Gold sold television sets for\n99 cents to the first 13 customers. He had developed his affinity for the\nprice point while working at a liquor shop at Grand Central Market downtown,\nwhen he would put closeout bottles of wine on a table and mark them down to 99\ncents.\n\nBusiness\n\n### 99 Cents Only to close all 371 stores and wind down its business\n\nThe City of Commerce deep-discount retailer, for years one of the few true\n\u201cdollar\u201d stores, calls it quits after more than four decades.\n\nApril 5, 2024\n\nAfter that first August morning, the everyday deals at 99 Cents Only weren\u2019t\ntelevision-set levels of spectacular, but the bargains were steep, and the\nextreme discounter became an essential stop within the community, son Howard\nGold recalled in an interview last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were jam-packed from the beginning,\u201d said Howard, who helped set up and\nmanage the fledgling store as a 22-year-old, stocking it with canned and paper\ngoods, candy, mugs, glassware, hair products and cosmetics that his father,\nwho died in 2013, bought in enormous quantities. \u201cIt was amazing values \u2014\npeople could go and get like three bags of stuff and spend $9.\u201d\n\nWithin two years, the family \u2014 all four Gold children eventually worked for 99\nCents Only in some capacity \u2014 had opened two more locations. By 1991, there\nwere two dozen.\n\nDavid Gold, the late founder of the 99 Cents Only chain, in 2002.\n\n(Beatrice de Gea / Associated Press)\n\nBusiness boomed over the next couple of decades, and the company had grown to\n289 stores in California, Texas, Arizona and Nevada by the time it agreed to\nbe sold in 2011 to Los Angeles private equity firm Ares Management and the\nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board.\n\nNow, all 371 stores are liquidating after the City of Commerce company\nabruptly announced last week that it was going out of business. It\u2019s a\nstunning fall for the beloved chain, whose stores are primarily located in\nurban areas and underserved communities, many of which lack close access to\ntraditional grocery stores.\n\nWhat happened? Company executives and industry analysts blamed a series of\nfactors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, escalating theft and crime,\ncompetition, big increases in operating costs stemming from high inflation and\nthe expense of servicing its debt. The company also cited significant minimum-\nwage jumps, particularly in California, where 265 of its stores are located.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe last several years have been extremely difficult,\u201d Chief Restructuring\nOfficer Christopher J. Wells said in a bankruptcy declaration filed Monday.\n\u201cThe company had no choice but to pass on to its customers some of the\nresulting costs, in the form of higher prices, which was met by significant\ncustomer resistance and reduced customer traffic.\u201d\n\nAn employee helps customers at a store in Los Angeles in 2008, the year the\ndiscount retailer began selling items for more than 99 cents.\n\n(Nick Ut / Associated Press)\n\nA representative for 99 Cents Only Stores did not respond to requests for\ncomment.\n\nThe privately held company, which has 10,874 employees, recorded operating\nlosses of $30.8 million in 2022 and nearly $60 million in the first three\nquarters of 2023.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, 99 Cents Only executives \u201cexhaustively\npursued\u201d options in an attempt to save the flailing discounter, Wells said. An\ninvestment bank hired by the company contacted 32 prospective buyers, and the\nchain reached out to existing shareholders and third parties about potentially\nfinancing a restructuring that would enable it to continue operating.\n\nBut none of those efforts panned out. Cash flow in the first quarter\n\u201ccontinued to rapidly deteriorate,\u201d Wells said, \u201cand time was not on the\ncompany\u2019s side.\u201d By March, a \u201csubstantial and increasing\u201d number of vendors\nhad tightened trade terms and shifted to cash on demand, and several landlords\nsent pay-or-quit default notices as the company struggled to make rent on\ntime.\n\nWhen 99 Cents Only Stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last\nweekend, it reported owing nearly $60 million to its 30 largest unsecured\ncreditors, including Frito-Lay, a Coca-Cola bottler and Colgate-Palmolive. It\nalso reported carrying $457 million of debt in loans and lines of credit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing-out-of-business sales began Friday and are expected to end April 19,\nwith prices storewide slashed by up to 30%.\n\n## The rise of an L.A. retail giant\n\nFrom the start, 99 Cents Only stood out from other dollar stores thanks to\nDavid Gold\u2019s buying prowess: his eye for spotting quality, brand-name products\nthat customers of all income levels would want, coupled with his willingness\nto purchase them from suppliers in vast amounts.\n\n\u201cWhen I put a 99-cent sign on anything, it was gone in no time,\u201d he said in a\n2003 Los Angeles Times article. \u201cI realized it was a magic number. I thought,\nwouldn\u2019t it be fun to have a store where everything was good quality and\neverything was 99 cents?\u201d\n\nHe was 50 when he opened the first 99 Cents Only store and handled nearly all\nof the company\u2019s buying for years, Howard said, with the rest of the family\nmanaging operations and logistics.\n\n\u201cMy dad in a lot of ways was very, very bold,\u201d Howard, 64, said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a\nperson who wrote out a business plan \u2014 he just did things.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1980s, dollar stores were seen as shabby dumping grounds for\nundesirable products, but the founder was proud of what he sold and wanted 99\nCents Only to \u201clook clean and well-organized even though they were closeout\nstores,\u201d Howard said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy dad really loved the merchandise,\u201d daughter Karen Schiffer said in his\n2013 Times obituary; despite making millions from 99 Cents Only, Gold lived\nmodestly and died in his Mid-Wilshire home at 80. \u201cHe would come home at the\nend of the day when we were younger and say, \u2018Look at this beautiful shampoo.\u2019\nHe would say, \u2018We have 50 truckloads of this Kleenex coming in.\u2019\u201d\n\n> \u201cWhen I put a 99-cent sign on anything, it was gone in no time.\u201d\n\n\u2014 David Gold\n\nOne time, just before the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, the retailer\npurchased 500,000 authentic Olympic souvenir hats for 37 cents each. It priced\nthem at 99 cents apiece, when other shops listed them at $8. The three 99\nCents Only stores were soon inundated with customers.\n\n\u201cWe had to hire security guards to hold people back,\u201d Thomas Hale, the\ncompany\u2019s vice president at the time, told The Times in 1991. \u201cBefore I could\ntake vanloads of the hats into the store, they were sold; they never made it\nto the counter. I had never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nA shopper looks through her groceries last week at a 99 Cents Only store in\nGlendale.\n\n(Michael Blackshire / Los Angeles Times)\n\nGold stayed true to the low price point and leaned heavily into the theme.\n\nOne advertisement congratulated the \u201cDodgers on Losing 99 Games.\u201d Another\nwished television personality Joan Rivers \u201cHappy 99th Facelift.\u201d He opened the\nstores from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., \u201cnine days a week.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia\n\n### Column: More than just a store, 99 Cents Only gave a fair shake to all who\nentered\n\nThose of us in the fellowship of frugality know that California\u2019s booms\ninevitably end in bust. That\u2019s what makes the end of the 99 Cents Only empire\nso distressing.\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nIn 1996, when it had about four dozen stores, 99 Cents Only went public on the\nNew York Stock Exchange at $14.50 a share. Just over a year later, it was\ntrading around $32.\n\nGold made the Forbes 400 list in 2002, with 142 stores in his fast-growing\nchain, no corporate debt and a personal fortune estimated at $650 million. He\nwas, according to some calculations, the 37th richest man in Los Angeles.\n\nStill, he continued to hold open-house days, inviting wholesalers and\nsuppliers to show off their wares over coffee and bagels that he provided.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to describe the crowd that lines the narrow hallway on\nthese days,\u201d the 2003 Times article said. \u201cThey come to Gold\u2019s City of\nCommerce headquarters hoping to sell everything from clothing to kites to\nhand-painted pottery, paper and housewares products.\u201d\n\n## New owners and a big debt load\n\nAfter 15 years as a publicly traded company, 99 Cents Only was the subject of\na bidding war by two Los Angeles investment firms.\n\nLeonard Green & Partners offered to take the retailer private, in a deal that\nvalued the company at $1.3 billion, but was topped by Ares and its pension\nfund partner. It was a period when investors were eyeing dollar stores that\nhad grown in popularity during the Great Recession.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult decision; we at the time weren\u2019t crazy about being\npublic,\u201d Howard recalled last week. \u201cWe felt like it put us in a position\nwhere we had to continually have smooth growth of numbers, which wasn\u2019t\nnecessarily that conducive to our business. We didn\u2019t want to have to deliver\nthe kind of numbers that Wall Street demanded.\u201d\n\nThe family management team remained for about a year after the deal was done,\ndeparting in 2013. Before that, David Gold\u2019s son-in-law Eric Schiffer was\nchief executive, son Jeff was chief administrative officer, and Howard worked\nas executive vice president of special projects.\n\nObituaries\n\n### Dave Gold dies at 80; entrepreneur behind 99 Cents Only chain\n\nDave Gold dies at 80; entrepreneur behind 99 Cents Only chain\n\nApril 26, 2013\n\nThe deal \u2014 which valued 99 Cents Only Stores at $1.6 billion \u2014 saddled the\ncompany with a debt load that turned a \u201cconservative balance sheet\u201d into a\n\u201chighly leveraged capital structure,\u201d Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services said\nin a report.\n\nThe company struggled with debt for years. Its financial position continued to\nerode even after it sold a City of Commerce distribution center last year for\n$190 million, then leased it back, to raise capital, according to S&P Global\nRatings.\n\nHoward declined to discuss the company\u2019s business after the family\u2019s exit,\nsaying only that the closures were \u201csad on so many levels.\u201d\n\n## Breaking the 99-cent barrier in 2008\n\nWell before the pandemic and the latest surge in inflation, 99 Cents Only\ndrifted from its original promise to keep all items under one dollar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2008, the company broke the 99-cent barrier for the first time amid fast-\nrising inflation, soaring food and fuel prices and a higher minimum wage \u2014\nmany of the same factors that ultimately felled it. The price change was\nrolled out gradually but accelerated in recent years.\n\nIn his bankruptcy declaration Monday, Wells said the percentage of merchandise\npriced at \u201c99.99 cents or less\u201d decreased from nearly 65% in 2020 to less than\n50% last year.\n\nSujeet Naik, an analyst for Coresight Research, noted that consumers have been\nlooking for deals to alleviate record inflation. As a deep discounter, 99\nCents Only would seem like an obvious money-saving solution \u2014 except the\ncompany was forced to raise prices as it, too, contended with inflationary\npressures.\n\nAnd with 99 Cents Only in the company name, the widening discrepancy between\nits longtime marketing hook and what was actually on the price tags became\nglaring to budget-conscious customers.\n\n\u201cTheir business model relied heavily on that psychological pricing of every\nitem being 99 cents only,\u201d Naik said.\n\nMaking matters worse, he added, inflation also hit the company\u2019s operational\ncosts, such as rent, labor and transportation, and it faced competition from\nlarger rivals with greater purchasing power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven some of its giant competitors have struggled of late.\n\nLast month Chesapeake, Va.-based Dollar Tree announced the closure of nearly\n1,000 Family Dollar stores over the next few years. The company, which\noperates hundreds of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores in California, said\nproduct costs have risen.\n\nAlthough 99 Cents Only wasn\u2019t able to secure a buyer in its final few months,\none local businessman says he is trying to save the company.\n\nMark Miller, founder and president of discounter Pic \u2018N\u2019 Save Bargains, said\nhe had put together an investment group that includes former 99 Cents Only\nexecutives to make a bid for all 143 stores in Southern California through the\nbankruptcy process.\n\n\u201cFor the past 10 years, they didn\u2019t have anybody running the company that had\nany understanding of what the business was about. They drifted away from what\nDavid Gold started,\u201d he told The Times on Tuesday, adding that his vision for\nthe stores would feature a mix of consistent inventory with surprise bargains\nhe likened to a \u201ctreasure hunt.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Ares declined to comment.\n\nThe closure of the stores will leave a number of large vacant properties in\nprime locations around the region. Hilco Real Estate is managing the sale of\nthe company\u2019s real estate assets, which are owned or leased.\n\nAt a 99 Cents Only store in Glendale on Friday, a day after the company\nannounced it was winding down its business, drivers jammed into the full\nparking lot, many pulling over to double-park wherever they could find space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInside the store, the checkout lines snaked through and around the aisles,\nmany of the shelves bare of merchandise.\n\nAlthough there were 2-liter bottles of grapeseed oil for $8, potted succulents\nfor $5 and stuffed animals and jump ropes for $4, plenty of items were marked\nat less than a dollar: cans of sweet corn and sliced carrots, packages of\nspicy ramen, liter bottles of electrolyte drinks and three-packs of sponges.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to find the same prices at any other store,\u201d shopper Rosemary\nLoera, 46, said as she left with a cart full of laundry detergent, cleaning\nsolution, pet food, grapes, pears and disposable plates. She spent more than\n$100 at the store, which she visits weekly.\n\nAntonio D. Charity, an actor from Burbank, arrived after hearing that the\nchain was shutting down. He has been a 99 Cents Only shopper for nearly 20\nyears, often showing up without a shopping list just to peruse the aisles and\nbuy based on the deals of the day.\n\n\u201cI know to come here after Thanksgiving, because a lot of products they didn\u2019t\nsell at the grocery stores, they\u2019ll wind up here. I know to come after\nValentine\u2019s; there\u2019ll be a lot of candy on the shelves,\u201d the 51-year-old said\nas he scooped up 10 boxes of diet tea. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss it.\u201d\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### San Francisco\u2019s iconic Union Square Macy\u2019s will close\n\nFeb. 27, 2024\n\n  * ### Patt Morrison: The death \u2014 or not? \u2014 of L.A.\u2019s shopping malls\n\nJan. 20, 2024\n\n  * ### The quest to stay open at Silver Crest Donut Shop, one of California\u2019s last 24-hour diners\n\nDec. 23, 2023\n\nBusiness\n\nAndrea Chang\n\nFollow Us\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Instagram\n  * Email\n  * Facebook\n\nAndrea Chang is a wealth reporter for the Los Angeles Times.
