There is a good deal of\ntruth in this, especially around the early Galaxy designs.\n\nBut Samsung is a global leader in screen technology, TVs, batteries, and chip\ndesign. So in terms of innovation it is doing a lot right. But we know very\nlittle about how.\n\nWe know how its competitors innovate - we look at Google and see the 20% time,\nthe big adjacencies, the search for disruption, the bold statements about the\nfuture of autos, for example.\n\nWe know that within Apple when a project gets to a critical stage, the company\nassigns three teams to its development, each of which competes against the\nother. We know the importance of design thinking, an attribute Google is\nlearning about. And of customer experience.\n\nWhat does Samsung do in comparison? How does it line up against these American\nmasters or conversely are Google and Apple good enough to compete against\nSamsung?\n\nThere's no doubt that patent circumvention is an aim when Samsung innovates.\nFrom its early forays into innovation, competing against Toshiba in washing\nand drying machines, Samsung has chased patents in areas where its competitors\nappear to have protection and has oriented its innovation efforts to find new\npatentable ideas in its competitors' backyard (see, for example, this Samsung\npresentation).\n\nThere's nothing unusual about that. It is a sideshow.\n\nTwo developments convinced the company in the late 1990s and early 2000s that\nthey could adopt a systematic approach to innovation and that is what seems to\nunderpin their current success.\n\nThe first development provides a broader explanation for Samsung's innovation\ncapacity. In the late 1990s they were able to tap into a source of cheap\nscientific expertise in the former Soviet Union.\n\nSamsung has nurtured a close relationship with the Russian Academy of Science\nsince then. There is a framework agreement between the two parties. And the\nKorean Government has its own agreement under which it funds Korean small\nbusinesses to develop projects on the back of Academy research. Samsung\nmeanwhile appears to help the Academy to increase its patent count and to\nexploit its inventions.\n\nThere is an undated copy of the framework agreement between them online and\nhere is an extract:\n\n> Academy warrants that Institutes of RAS have the necessary authority to\n> transfer Inventions on separate contracts (\"Concrete Agreement\") to Samsung\n> for evaluation, and support Samsung to share part in ownership of Inventions\n> and Patents\n\nOne early advantage for Samsung was cheap fundamental science from Russia. But\neven now Samsung is able to buy Russian expertise at relatively low rates of\nbetween $3,000 to $5,000 per month.\n\nCompare that with Google and Apple - in the post-9/11 era access to the\nworld's best talent has become increasingly difficult because of a reluctance\nto grant enough visas. Samsung had that problem cracked. But then again didn't\nApple and Google - both are a magnet for talent.\n\nHas the Russian connection shown concrete value for Samsung?\n\nRight now Samsung is working on 3D projection and display with the Academy. In\n2009 BusinessWeek reported that Samsung relied on its relationships with\nRussian experts for its smartphone software development, adding:\n\n> Russian brains helped Samsung develop the image-processing chips in its\n> digital TVs and refine its frequency-filtering technology that significantly\n> reduced noise on its now-ubiquitous handsets.\n\nBut a second effect of the relationship with Russian science was the\nintroduction of TRIZ, an innovation method that Samsung adopted from 2000\nonwards but which only reached American companies from the mid-2000s onwards\n(Intel is a user).\n\nTRIZ is a methodology for systematic problem solving. Typical of its origins\nin Russia, it asks users to seek the contradictions in current technological\nconditions and customer needs and to imagine an ideal state that innovation\nshould drive towards.\n\nSamsung had early successes with TRIZ, saving over $100 million in its first\nfew projects. It was also adopting Six Sigma at the time.\n\nBut it was TRIZ that became the bedrock of innovation at Samsung. And it was\nintroduced at Samsung by Russian engineers whom Samsung had hired into its\nSeoul Labs in the early 2000s.\n\nIn 2003 TRIZ led to 50 new patents for Samsung and in 2004 one project alone,\na DVD pick-up innovation, saved Samsung over $100 million. TRIZ is now an\nobligatory skill set if you want to advance within Samsung.\n\nAt the Samsung Advanced Institute for Technology, Hyo June Kim, who wrote The\nTheory of Inventive Problem Solving, a foundation text on TRIZ published in\nKorean, trained over 1,000 engineers across Samsung companies in 2004 alone.\n\nWhat we know from this is how Samsung approaches innovation. It is not a\ncompetitive race, as it seems to be in Apple, or based on giving engineers\nmore bench time as it is at Google.\n\nRather it is based on developing a creative elite. The diagram below explains\nthat. It is taken from this presentation. The presentation also explains how\nSamsung used TRIZ to get to its Super AMOLED displays.\n\nInterestingly for Samsung observers, senior management had realized that the\ncompany was a fast follower rather than an innovator, prior to the\nintroduction of TRIZ:\n\n> Samsung Electronics has a sense of crisis that we have been a fast follower\n> and we can not survive anymore in this position. Instead of leading the\n> industry by developing innovative products, we have followed fast what the\n> leading companies had developed. Top management pointed out this and asked\n> employee not to be a fast follower, but to be an innovative leader.\n\nTRIZ is now part of Samsung's workflow.\n\nAt Samsung even the subsidiary CEO has to take TRIZ training. From looking at\nthe various presentations I estimate that engineers get about 15 days of\ntraining plus 7 days specific project work. That's quite an investment in\nmethod and people.\n\nSo the answer to why Samsung is so innovative - with at least two major\nproduct announcements this month - is that it is heavily invested in its\npeople, it goes in search of special talent wherever it can find it, but\nspecifically made astute moves into Russia early on; it targets its\ninnovations towards specific competitors and patents that it wants to overhaul\n(as Apple did under Jobs); and it has an innovation culture based on extensive\ntraining, repeatable methodology and creative elite formation, backed by the\nhighest levels of management.\n\nYou can argue that method and creativity don't go together but that's a\nspecious argument from the start.\n\nYou can also argue that Apple and Google have better innovation processes,\nmore free and more compelling for talented engineers. But what you can't argue\nis that Samsung does not do innovation. It is proving every day that it is\nformidable and heavily invested in taking leadership in many areas.\n\nThe message for Apple and Google - get used to it because Samsung is not only\non a roll, it has enough talented people to keep pushing.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @haydn1701 or join me on Facebook\n\n#### Gallery: The Ten Most Innovative Companies in Asia\n\n10 images\n\nView gallery\n\nHaydn Shaughnessy\n\nI used to edit Innovation Management.
