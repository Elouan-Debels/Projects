Credit: Eli Hartman/The Texas\nTribune\n\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers\nup to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nStudents sitting for their STAAR exams this week will be part of a new method\nof evaluating Texas schools: Their written answers on the state\u2019s standardized\ntests will be graded automatically by computers.\n\nThe Texas Education Agency is rolling out an \u201cautomated scoring engine\u201d for\nopen-ended questions on the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness\nfor reading, writing, science and social studies. The technology, which uses\nnatural language processing technology like artificial intelligence chatbots\nsuch as GPT-4, will save the state agency about $15-20 million per year that\nit would otherwise have spent on hiring human scorers through a third-party\ncontractor.\n\nThe change comes after the STAAR test, which measures students\u2019 understanding\nof state-mandated core curriculum, was redesigned in 2023. The test now\nincludes fewer multiple choice questions and more open-ended questions \u2014 known\nas constructed response items. After the redesign, there are six to seven\ntimes more constructed response items.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to keep as many constructed open ended responses as we can, but\nthey take an incredible amount of time to score,\u201d said Jose Rios, director of\nstudent assessment at the Texas Education Agency.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nIn 2023, Rios said TEA hired about 6,000 temporary scorers, but this year, it\nwill need under 2,000.\n\nTo develop the scoring system, the TEA gathered 3,000 responses that went\nthrough two rounds of human scoring. From this field sample, the automated\nscoring engine learns the characteristics of responses, and it is programmed\nto assign the same scores a human would have given.\n\nThis spring, as students complete their tests, the computer will first grade\nall the constructed responses. Then, a quarter of the responses will be\nrescored by humans.\n\nWhen the computer has \u201clow confidence\u201d in the score it assigned, those\nresponses will be automatically reassigned to a human. The same thing will\nhappen when the computer encounters a type of response that its programming\ndoes not recognize, such as one using lots of slang or words in a language\nother than English.\n\n\u201cWe have always had very robust quality control processes with humans,\u201d said\nChris Rozunick, division director for assessment development at the Texas\nEducation Agency. With a computer system, the quality control looks similar.\n\nEvery day, Rozunick and other testing administrators will review a summary of\nresults to check that they match what is expected. In addition to \u201clow\nconfidence\u201d scores and responses that do not fit in the computer\u2019s\nprogramming, a random sample of responses will also be automatically handed\noff to humans to check the computer\u2019s work.\n\nTEA officials have been resistant to the suggestion that the scoring engine is\nartificial intelligence. It may use similar technology to chatbots such as\nGPT-4 or Google\u2019s Gemini, but the agency has stressed that the process will\nhave systematic oversight from humans. It won\u2019t \u201clearn\u201d from one response to\nthe next, but always defer to its original programming set up by the state.\n\n\u201cWe are way far away from anything that\u2019s autonomous or can think on its own,\u201d\nRozunick said.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nBut the plan has still generated worry among educators and parents in a world\nstill weary of the influence of machine learning, automation and AI.\n\nSome educators across the state said they were caught by surprise at TEA\u2019s\ndecision to use automated technology \u2014 also known as hybrid scoring \u2014 to score\nresponses.\n\n\u201cThere ought to be some consensus about, hey, this is a good thing, or not a\ngood thing, a fair thing or not a fair thing,\u201d said Kevin Brown, the executive\ndirector for the Texas Association of School Administrators and a former\nsuperintendent at Alamo Heights ISD.\n\nRepresentatives from TEA first mentioned interest in automated scoring in\ntestimony to the Texas House Public Education Committee in August 2022. In the\nfall of 2023, the agency announced the move to hybrid scoring at a conference\nand during test coordinator training before releasing details of the process\nin December.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe STAAR test results are a key part of the accountability system TEA uses to\ngrade school districts and individual campuses on an A-F scale. Students take\nthe test every year from third grade through high school. When campuses within\na district are underperforming on the test, state law allows the Texas\neducation commissioner to intervene.\n\nThe commissioner can appoint a conservator to oversee campuses and school\ndistricts. State law also allows the commissioner to suspend and replace\nelected school boards with an appointed board of managers. If a campus\nreceives failing grades for five years in a row, the commissioner is required\nto appoint a board of managers or close that school.\n\nWith the stakes so high for campuses and districts, there is a sense of\nuneasiness about a computer\u2019s ability to score responses as well as a human\ncan.\n\n\u201cThere's always this sort of feeling that everything happens to students and\nto schools and to teachers and not for them or with them,\u201d said Carrie\nGriffith, policy specialist for the Texas State Teachers Association.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nA former teacher in the Austin Independent School District, Griffith added\nthat even if the automated scoring engine works as intended, \u201cit's not\nsomething parents or teachers are going to trust.\u201d\n\nSuperintendents are also uncertain.\n\n\u201cThe automation is only as good as what is programmed,\u201d said Lori Rapp,\nsuperintendent at Lewisville ISD. School districts have not been given a\ndetailed enough look at how the programming works, Rapp said.\n\nThe hybrid scoring system was already used on a limited basis in December\n2023. Most students who take the STAAR test in December are retaking it after\na low score. That\u2019s not the case for Lewisville ISD, where high school\nstudents on an altered schedule test for the first time in December, and Rapp\nsaid her district saw a \u201cdrastic increase\u201d in zeroes on constructed responses.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we are unable to determine if there is something wrong with the\ntest question or if it is the new automated scoring system,\u201d Rapp said.\n\nThe state overall saw an increase in zeroes on constructed responses in\nDecember 2023, but the TEA said there are other factors at play. In December\n2022, the only way to score a zero was by not providing an answer at all. With\nthe STAAR redesign in 2023, students can receive a zero for responses that may\nanswer the question but lack any coherent structure or evidence.\n\nThe TEA also said that students who are retesting will perform at a different\nlevel than students taking the test for the first time. \u201cPopulation difference\nis driving the difference in scores rather than the introduction of hybrid\nscoring,\u201d a TEA spokesperson said in an email.\n\nFor $50, students and their parents can request a rescore if they think the\ncomputer or the human got it wrong. The fee is waived if the new score is\nhigher than the initial score. For grades 3-8, there are no consequences on a\nstudent\u2019s grades or academic progress if they receive a low score. For high\nschool students, receiving a minimum STAAR test score is a common way to\nfulfill one of the state graduation requirements, but it is not the only way.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nEven with layers of quality control, Round Rock ISD Superintendent Hafedh\nAzaiez said he worries a computer could \u201cmiss certain things that a human\nbeing may not be able to miss,\u201d and that room for error will impact students\nwho Azaiez said are \u201ctrying to do his or her best.\u201d\n\nTest results will impact \u201chow they see themselves as a student,\u201d Brown said,\nand it can be \u201chumiliating\u201d for students who receive low scores. With human\ngraders, Brown said, \u201cstudents were rewarded for having their own voice and\noriginality in their writing,\u201d and he is concerned that computers may not be\nas good at rewarding originality.\n\nJulie Salinas, director of assessment, research and evaluation at Brownsville\nISD said she has concerns about whether hybrid scoring is \u201callowing the\nstudents the flexibility to respond\u201d in a way that they can demonstrate their\n\u201cfull capability and thought process through expressive writing.\u201d\n\nBrownsville ISD is overwhelmingly Hispanic. Students taking an assessment\nentirely in Spanish will have their tests graded by a human. If the automated\nscoring engine works as intended, responses that include some Spanish words or\ncolloquial, informal terms will be flagged by the computer and assigned to a\nhuman so that more creative writing can be assessed fairly.\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nThe system is designed so that it \u201cdoes not penalize students who answer\ndifferently, who are really giving unique answers,\u201d Rozuick said.\n\nWith the computer scoring now a part of STAAR, Salinas is focused on adapting.\nThe district is incorporating tools with automated scoring into how teachers\nprepare students for the STAAR test to make sure they are comfortable.\n\n\u201cOur district is on board and on top of the things that we need to do to\nensure that our students are successful,\u201d she said.\n\nDisclosure: Google, the Texas Association of School Administrators and Texas\nState Teachers Association have been financial supporters of The Texas\nTribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by\ndonations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.
