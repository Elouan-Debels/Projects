The FCC published its proposal, a so-called Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking (NPRM), in October 2023. The comments period ended in mid-January.\nA vote is expected in late April.\n\nWhen the FCC announced it would be restoring the net neutrality protections\nthat the FCC eliminated in 2017, the agency said it wanted to restore the 2015\nnet neutrality protections.\n\nI strongly support this goal, and the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking includes\nmany of the protections included in the 2015 Open Internet Order.\n\nBut the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking misses some critical protections in the\n2015 Order, creating potential loopholes for Internet Service Providers (ISPs)\nto exploit.\n\nOn March 13, I submitted a White Paper to the Commission with seven\nsuggestions for how to strengthen the Open Internet Proposal.\n\nThey are:\n\n\u00b7 Throttling: The proposed rules inadequately address the issue of ISPs\nmanipulating internet traffic by speeding up applications or classes of\napplications. The 2024 protections need to explicitly prohibit both negative\nand positive discrimination among apps.\n\n\u00b7 Reasonable Network Management: The NPRM misses a crucial part of the 2015\nOrder\u2019s definition of \u201creasonable network management,\u201d which opens a loophole\nthat ISPs could exploit to circumvent net neutrality principles. Reasonable\nnetwork management must be as application-agnostic as possible and technically\njustified.\n\n\u00b7 Specialized Services/Non-BIAS Data Services: ISPs are seeking to bypass Open\nInternet protections under the guise of \u201cspecialized services,\u201d particularly\nwith 5G fast lanes. The FCC needs to prevent ISPs from exploiting this label\nto create fast lanes that are otherwise prohibited.\n\n\u00b7 Transparency: The FCC's 2017 Repeal Order significantly weakened ISP\ntransparency reporting. Restoring the 2015 transparency rules would help\npeople choose the internet service plan that is best for them by restoring ISP\nreporting requirements on network performance, including during peak times and\nby geographic area.\n\n\u00b7 Interconnection: The NPRM lacks the 2015 Order\u2019s explicit prohibition\nagainst ISPs circumventing net neutrality where data enters their networks,\noften referred to as the point of interconnection. ISPs exploited this\nloophole in the past to degrade internet performance in order to force apps to\npay the ISPs, impacting millions of Americans.\n\n\u00b7 State Net Neutrality Laws: The FCC needs to preserve state net neutrality\nlaws as they provide additional protections and enforcement and have not\nproven burdensome for ISPs. Federal net neutrality protections should set the\nminimum standard, allowing states to enforce stricter rules.\n\n\u00b7 Zero-Rating: The FCC should set clear rules against ISPs using harmful zero-\nrating to distort competition or favor certain applications, drawing on\nCalifornia's net neutrality law as a model.\n\nYou can read the full White Paper here.\n\nFocus Areas:\n\nArchitecture and Public Policy\n\n## Add new comment\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n\nBuilt by New Signature, powered by Drupal\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\nLicense.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
