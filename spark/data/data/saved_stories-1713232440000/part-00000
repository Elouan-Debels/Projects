The\nInstitute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a nonprofit think-tank, found a number\nof posts that claimed to reveal the strikes and their impact, but instead used\nAI-generated videos, photos, and repurposed footage from other conflicts that\nshowed rockets launching into the night, explosions, and even President Joe\nBiden in military fatigues.\n\nJust 34 of these misleading posts received over 37 million views, according to\nISD. Many of the accounts posting the misinformation were also verified,\nmeaning they have paid X $8 per month for the \u2018blue tick\u2019 and their content is\namplified by the platform\u2019s algorithm. ISD also found that several of the\naccounts claimed to be open source intelligence (OSINT) experts, which has, in\nrecent years, become another way of giving legitimacy to their posts.\n\nOne X post claimed that \u201cWW3 has officially started,\u201d and included a video\nseeming to show rockets being shot into the night\u2014except the video was\nactually from a YouTube video posted in 2021. Another post claimed to show the\nuse of the Iron Dome, Israel's missile defense system, during the attack, but\nthe video was actually from October 2023. Both these posts garnered hundreds\nof thousands of views in the hours after the strike was announced, and both\noriginated from verified accounts. Iranian media also shared a video of the\nwildfires in Chile earlier this year, claiming it showed the aftermath of the\nattacks. This, too, began to circulate on X.\n\nFeatured Video\n\n\u201cThe fact that so much mis- and disinformation is being spread by accounts\nlooking for clout or financial benefit is giving cover to even more nefarious\nactors, including Iranian state media outlets who are passing off footage from\nthe Chilean wildfires as damage from Iranian strikes on Israel to claim the\noperation as a military success,\u201d says Isabelle Frances-Wright, director of\ntechnology and society at ISD. \u201cThe corrosion of the information landscape is\nundermining the ability of audiences to distinguish truth from falsehood on a\nterrible scale.\u201d\n\nX did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication.\n\nThough misinformation around conflict and crises has long found a home on\nsocial media, X is often also used for vital real-time information. But under\nElon Musk\u2019s leadership, the company cut back on content moderation and\ndisinformation has thrived. In the days following the October 7 Hamas attack,\nX was flooded with disinformation, making it difficult for legitimate OSINT\nresearchers to surface information. Under Musk, X has promoted a crowd-sourced\ncommunity notes function as a way to combat misinformation on the platform to\nvarying results. Some of the content identified by ISD has since received\ncommunity notes, though only two posts had by the time the organization\npublished its findings.\n\n\u201cDuring times of crisis it seems to be a repeating pattern on platforms such\nas X where premium accounts are inherently tainting the information ecosystem\nwith half truths as well as falsehoods either through misidentified media, or\nblatantly false imagery suggesting that an event has been caused by a certain\nactor or state,\u201d says Moustafa Ayad, ISD executive director for Asia, the\nMiddle East and Africa. \u201cThis continues to happen and will continue to happen\nin the future, making it even more difficult to know what is real and what is\nnot.\u201d\n\nAnd for those that are part of X\u2019s subscription model and ad revenue sharing\nmodel, going viral could potentially mean making money.\n\nThough it\u2019s not clear that any of the users spreading fake or misleading\ninformation identified by ISD were monetizing their content, a separate report\nreleased by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) earlier this month\nfound that between October 7 and February 7, ten influencers, including far-\nright influencer Jackson Hinkle, were able to grow their followings by posting\nantisemitic and Islmaphobic content about the conflict. Six of the accounts\nCCDH examined were part of X\u2019s subscription program, and all ten were verified\nusers. The high-profile influencers part of X\u2019s ad revenue sharing program\nreceive a cut of advertising revenue based on \u201dorganic impressions of ads\ndisplayed in replies\u201d to their content, according to the company.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nRoku Breach Hits 567,000 Users\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Security\n\nHow Israel Defended Against Iran's Drone and Missile Attack\n\nBrian Barrett\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * Navigate election season with our Politics Lab newsletter and podcast\n\n  * Think Google\u2019s \u201cIncognito mode\u201d protects your privacy?
