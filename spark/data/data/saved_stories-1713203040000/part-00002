It hasn\u2019t been all smooth sailing for\nthe silvery wedge since finally making its long-overdue debut on the market,\nwith glitches including videos depicting difficulty in dealing with snow,\ncorrosion worries despite its stainless-steel skin, and sidewall-eating wheel\ncovers marring its positive press.\n\nThe latest Cyber-bug, however, could be a showstopper \u2013 and literally a sales-\nstopper, as Tesla has allegedly halted deliveries of the pickup as customer\ncomplaints about scary stuck-throttle incidents have begun to appear.\n\n2025 Toyota 4Runner Walkaround\n\nNews of halted deliveries hit the Cybertruck Owners Forum this past weekend.\nReservation holders have reported being told their deliveries had been\ncanceled due to an \u201cunexpected delay.\u201d Affected customers weren\u2019t directly\nnotified as to the reason for the cancellations.\n\nAt this time, it\u2019s widely believed that an accelerator-pedal issue is behind\nTesla\u2019s decision to temporarily halt deliveries. Supporting this is a TikTok\nvideo from Cybertruck owner @el.chepito1985. He describes what happened when\nhis truck\u2019s accelerator pedal came apart in a way that prevented the pedal\nfrom lifting and disengaging the throttle. Thankfully the driver\u2019s quick\nreactions allowed him to avoid a crash.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe cause of the issue appears to be the accelerator pedal\u2019s cover. As seen in\nthe video, the metal-trimmed plastic cover separated from the plastic pedal\nunderneath. The cover slid up the pedal and caught in the edge of the lower\ndash panel, jamming the accelerator pedal in its maximum-throttle position.\nThe driver was able to stop the Cybetruck by hitting the brake, which overrode\nthe signal from the accelerator pedal. The vehicle was safely brought to a\nstop and put in park, at which point the issue became obvious.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple problem, but one that could absolutely explain why Tesla has\nstopped delivering Cybertrucks. In the video, we can see the cover appears to\nmerely clip onto the actual pedal. There\u2019s no obvious adhesives or other\nfasteners helping to hold it in place.\n\nThe owner demonstrating how the throttle became stuck when the pedal cover\nslid off and became caught.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen in previous cases of unintended acceleration, all it takes is a\npoorly designed floor mat or piece of trim to jam the throttle wide open. In\nsuch a situation, a driver can easily lose control of the vehicle. Outcomes\nare typically worse if the driver panics due to sudden acceleration. Thus,\nrectifying the issue before more trucks ship out to customers makes perfect\nsense. Failure to do so could lead to dangerous crashes, injuries, or worse.\n\nThis could be an easy fix for Tesla. The company could arrange for manual\nrework of existing trucks by riveting or gluing the accelerator pedal covers\nin place if they are, indeed, not already glued or riveted together. A good\nepoxy would do the job well, though Tesla may elect to install a fastener for\nadditional peace of mind.\n\nThe pedal cover appears to be a simple slide-on part with nothing locking it\nonto the plastic pedal underneath. This explains how it could slide up and\npotentially jam against the cabin interior.\n\nAt this stage, we can\u2019t be 100% certain that the accelerator pedal cover is\nthe root cause behind the delivery halt or even if deliveries are halted. In\npart, this is because Tesla does not provide a press contact to advise us on\nthese issues. The Autopian has contacted the NHTSA for comment on whether a\nstop-sale order is in place, and we will update this story as more information\nbecomes available.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince we\u2019re talking about it, this is also a great time to educate yourself on\nwhat to do in a stuck-throttle situation. It\u2019s good to remember that modern\nvehicles have powerful brakes which are often capable of stopping the vehicle\neven under such conditions. Some modern drive-by-wire vehicles will also\ncancel the throttle command when the brake is applied. You can also shift into\nneutral to disconnect the engine from the transmission in an ICE-powered\nvehicle. In vehicles with a pushbutton starter, holding the engine start\nbutton down will kill the engine or cut drive power. In a key-start vehicle,\nyou can use the key to turn the engine off, but you may lose power steering\nand power braking, and you may lock the steering wheel if you\u2019re not careful.\n\nFundamentally, though, the video above is a bad look for Tesla. A vehicle\u2019s\nbasic controls should be stout and properly manufactured. It\u2019s poor form to\nsee pedals falling apart on a brand-new vehicle. Here\u2019s hoping the problem can\nbe sorted quickly and no injuries or crashes result from this flaw.\n\nImage credits: Tesla, el.chepito1985 via TikTok screenshot\n\n  * BigFeatured, Cybertruck, NHTSA, stuck throttle, Tesla, throttle, throttle jam\n\nShare on facebook\n\nFacebook\n\nShare on whatsapp\n\nWhatsApp\n\nShare on twitter\n\nTwitter\n\nShare on linkedin\n\nLinkedIn\n\nShare on reddit\n\nReddit\n\n#### Lewin Day\n\nA madcap engineer who loves a good montage.

All the complaints come down to placating to a\nfucking maniac of a CEO, which directed much of the engineering.\n\nShit like this happens all the time in car manufacturing.

Given it\u2019s something that looks premium but 95%+ of\nbuyers will never touch with anything but their feet, it\u2019s far far cheaper to\nmake them plastic.\n\nThat said I\u2019m nearly certain every single other automaker has a design that\ndoes not slide off when using the throttle the way its designed to be used,\nwhich in this case is completely inexcusable and really terrible cost cutting.\n\n2\n\nSteve's House of Cars\n\n31 minutes ago\n\nReply to Alexk98\n\nMy Chrysler 300C and my Charger Scat Pack both had stainless look covers. They\nuse tight fitting rubber to hold it in place on the brake pedal and clips on\nthe gas pedal.\n\nDefinitely common on the industry, but at the Cyber truck price point seems\ncheesy.\n\n0\n\nMy Goat Ate My Homework\n\n3 minutes ago\n\nReply to EVDesigner\n\nPretty standard. Not the part where it slides off and keeps the gas pedal\npegged.\n\nMost covers are plastic, some have a thin stainless skin glued to the plastic\nto make it look pretty.\n\n0\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n### A Tuner Is Working On A \u2018Velocity Stack\u2019 Mod For Modern BMWs And Lots Of\nPeople Are Pumped\n\nApril 14, 2024 11 Comments\n\n### I Bought A $900 Audi S4 From Copart And Made It Road Legal, Here\u2019s How I\nDid It\n\n### Here\u2019s How Hilariously Un-Aerodynamic The 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Is\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMenu\n\nMenu\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Autopian.
