In each session block, I was forced to miss at\nleast one session I really wanted to see but luckily, all of the sessions were\nrecorded and are now available on the DCFL website.\n\n### Tips for technical documentation with Kurt Trowbridge\n\nGiven that I don't do much directly in Drupal anymore, I decided to start the\nday with Documentation for developers: A gift to your future self by Kurt\nTrowbridge. Documentation is a crucial part of developer relations given it is\noften one of the first touchpoints a developer has with your product so I\nhoped that Kurt would challenge some of my conceptions about what constitutes\ngood documentation and possibly bring up some ideas I had overlooked, and I\nwas not let down.\n\nWhile Kurt brought up some points I already agree with\u2014including documentation\nbeing everyone's responsibility and making documentation part of your\ndefinition of done\u2014he also shared the concept of chunking which I had not\nthought of previously in relation to our documentation strategy.\n\nIf you're not familiar with chunking, it refers to the concept of grouping\ninformation into chunks to reduce the overall number of items to remember in\nan effort to improve our ability to recall the information later from memory.\nThe concept was created by cognitive psychologist George Miller in 1956 and\npublished as an article in Psychological Review. It explains why it is easier\nto remember the number 5,732,562,145 as (573) 256-2145 by chunking the\ninformation into distinct groups of information, our brains are more efficient\nat committing it to memory and later recalling it. I remember Miller's Law\nfrom my college psychology classes but had never considered it in terms of how\nit might be applied to technical documentation. We're now discussing\ninternally how we might use this concept to break up some of the more dense\ndocumentation into more easily digestible, and memorable chunks.\n\nAnother thing Kurt mentioned that really resonated with me is to document\nwhere you're going to see it. We have fairly thorough documentation; almost\neverything you can do is explained in the documentation. However, we still see\nissues where customers are confused and ask questions that are answered in the\ndocs. There's obviously a disconnect and this statement gave me pause; maybe\nwe're not surfacing the information they need where they'll see it. We're now\ngoing back and trying to see where we can inject this information so it's\nexposed more directly where a developer is most likely to see it when needed.\n\n### Git going with GitHub Actions\n\nThe next session was my session! Introduction to GitHub Actions: Understanding\nKey Terms and Building Your First GitHub Action\u2014recording now available. I had\na great group of attendees who were engaged and willing to interact as we\nmoved through the materials, walking through the steps of building our first\nGitHub workflow, our first GitHub action, and then combining the two to begin\nthe journey of automating tasks surrounding our codebase.\n\n### Tighten up your Drupal code with PHPStan\n\nAfter a fabulous taco lunch, catered by Gringos Locos\u2014I highly recommend if\nyou ever have a chance to visit one of their locations\u2014it was back to\nlearning. The next session for me was Tighten up your Drupal code using\nPHPStan with Matt Glaman. I've used PHPStan numerous times in the past, but\nsince I haven't done much PHP development over the last year or so, I was a\nbit behind on where the project is currently. Not only has it been busy\nkeeping up with the latest PHP versions, but they've greatly improved its\ncapabilities in improving your code, catching bugs and issues, and overall\nimproving the developer experience. But the most surprising thing I learned is\nthat Drupal core and contributed modules now run PHPStan for every commit\nagainst Rule Level 0, with an active initiative to move the entire codebase to\npassing Rule Level 2.\n\n### Accessibility through alternative text with AmyJune Hineline\n\nNext up was Beyond \"99 Red Balloons\" - A Pragmatic guide to alternative text\nwith AmyJune Hineline. While I do still generate content, I generally do not\nneed to worry about being responsible for alternative text for images.\nNevertheless, I have a deep passion for all things accessibility; not to\nmention, AmyJune and I have known each other for many years but I've never had\nan opportunity to see her give a presentation and I was not disappointed.\nUsing classic album covers from the past four decades as her examples, she\ncovered various ways the image could be described and how that description\nmight change based on the context around the image. She shared a statement\nfrom Eric Meyers that resonated with me, \"When you call something an 'edge\ncase' you're really just defining the edges of what you care about.\" Given\neveryone will face a disability at some point, accessibility touches us at\nall. It was refreshing to see others feel the same that accessibility to\ncontent and an online experience should be available for everyone, and that\nthere is no edge case when it comes to accessibility.\n\nBut the biggest ah-ha moment for me was when she showed how you can have\nGoogle provide live captions when giving a presentation using Google Slides.\nAs long as your computer mic can pick up your voice it will add the captions\nto the top or bottom of your presentation. Then, if the presentation is\nrecorded (like they were at DrupalCamp) they're burned into the recording. I\nsincerely wish I had known about this for the last couple of years as I would\nhave added it to every presentation but now I know for the future.\n\n### Why Drupal developers should be using Laravel\n\nThe last full presentation I attended was Why Drupal developers should also be\nusing Laravel by Lee Walker. The core idea was that if you have any CRUD-style\nrequirements, it's far easier and more efficient to build it in Laravel\ninstead of in Drupal. In addition, most developers' experience and knowledge\nin Drupal will directly transfer over to Laravel. Lee also gave a walk-through\nof the various offerings in the Laravel ecosystem, as well as the various\nofferings available for learning Laravel, like Bootcamp Laravel and Laracasts.\nHe also discussed how great care is given to the Laravel docs; from what he\ndescribed every docs page is touched when a new update comes out. I've always\nbeen impressed with the quality of Laravel's documentation, and somehow am now\neven more impressed.\n\n### Quickfire takeaways from DrupalCamp Florida 2024\n\nDrupalCamp ended with Lightning Talks: short, 5-minute or less impromptu\nsessions that anyone can volunteer to do. There were the typical calls for\nattending DrupalCamp Asheville and random facts about Florida\u2014I did not know\nFlorida is one of the few places that has both alligators and crocodiles and\nhas 6 different species of monkeys\u2014 but also several other interesting items I\nwas unaware of including:\n\n  * Coderabbit: an AI-based code review tool for your pull requests. Particularly useful if you're a team of one and don't like having to review and approve your own code reviews\n  * https://claude.ai/: an alternative to ChatGPT\n  * Stable Cascade: a text-to-image AI generation tool\n  * Microsoft's Co-pilot can use ChatGPT 3.5 and gives you 30 requests per day\n  * Cursor.sh: an AI-powered pair-programming tool\n  * There is a somewhat long, passionate debate over whether the Drupal Recommended project should include a .gitignore file by default, or an example.gitignore, or nothing\n  * Even though DDEV was not officially at this year's DrupalCamp FL, it did make a surprise appearance\u2014one of the door prizes they gave away was a DDEV pillowcase. I had no idea such a thing even existed, but as it turns out, you can buy your very own DDEV pillowcase if you desire.\n  * F.A.S.T. stroke detection\n\n    * F = Face drooping\n    * A = Arm weakness\n    * S = Speech issues/difficulties\n    * T = time to call 911\n\nI'd like to thank all the organizers of DrupalCamp Florida again for putting\ntogether a well-orchestrated conference and a solid line-up of presenters and\npresentations. I hope I'm able to join you again next year!\n\n##### Get the latest Platform.sh news and resources\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Related Content\n\n### Limit deployments to Platform.sh only with tags: part three\n\n### DrupalCamp Florida 2024: sharing takeaways from the experts\n\n### One codebase, many projects: Drupal multisite fleet management\n\n4\n\n9\n\n3\n\n3\n\n7\n\nDeployments this week (including Fridays!)\n\n###### Company\n\nAboutSecurity and complianceTrust CenterCareersPressContact us\n\n###### Compare\n\nHeroku alternativePantheon alternativeAcquia alternativeAWS alternativeGCP\nalternativeAzure alternativeManaged hostingKubernetes alternativeFly.io\nalternativeRender alternative\n\n###### Resources\n\nBlogROI CalculatorDownloadsDemosSupport CenterWhat is FleetOps?CI/CD on\nPlatform.shPartner portalRegions map\n\n###### Product\n\nPricingWhat is Platform.sh?What can you run on Platform.sh?Drupal cloud\nhostingWordPress cloud hostingResources Auto-ScalingObservability Suite\n\nJoin our monthly newsletter\n\nThank you for subscribing!\n\n4\n\n9\n\n3\n\n3\n\n7\n\nDeployments this week (including Fridays!)\n\nSystem StatusPrivacyTerms of ServiceImpressumWCAG ComplianceAcceptable Use\nPolicyManage your cookie preferencesReport a security issue\n\n\u00a9 2024 Platform.sh.
