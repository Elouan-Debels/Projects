(Image credit:\nGeorgi Fadejev via Getty Images)\n\nScientists have discovered a universal pattern of brain waves in multiple\nprimate species, including humans.\n\nThis pattern of electrical activity is seen in the six layers of tissue that\ncover the outside of mammals' brains, known as the cerebral cortex. In\nprimates, higher frequency waves of electrical activity dance through the most\nsuperficial layers while slower waves bubble in layers below.\n\nThe ubiquitousness of these brain waves was revealed in a recent study,\npublished in January in the journal Nature Neuroscience. And previous research\nconducted by some of the same researchers suggests that the distinct activity\npatterns may reflect how the brain consciously switches focus from one piece\nof information to the next.\n\nThe slower brain waves in deeper portions of the cortex act as gatekeepers,\ndictating which bits of information enter and remain in conscious thought,\nsaid senior study author Andr\u00e9 Bastos, an assistant professor of psychology at\nVanderbilt University. The fast waves, which reflect those conscious thoughts,\nare called gamma rhythms and range between 50 and 150 hertz. The slow waves,\nmeanwhile, are called alpha-beta rhythms and run about 10 to 30 hertz.\n\n\"You have information coming in that can get represented by gamma bursts and\nspikes,\" Bastos told Live Science. \"And then you can have another mechanism\nfor saying, 'I don't care anymore, turn that off.\" That's the alpha-beta\nwaves' job \u2014 to yank one thought off stage to let another on.\n\nRelated: Most detailed human brain map ever contains 3,300 cell types\n\nWhile previously a postdoctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology (MIT), Bastos led a number of monkey studies to reveal how this\nmechanism works in some parts of the cerebral cortex. Now, in the January\npaper, \"we showed the universality of those patterns,\" he said. The scientists\nfound that the pattern consistently cropped up in 14 different regions of the\ncortex, not just a handful.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n\"What we have shown here is that it's not just present in one area or another\narea, but it's really present throughout,\" Bastos said. And the researchers\nalso showed that it appears in three different primates: macaques (Macaca),\nmarmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and humans.\n\nScientists across four institutions \u2014 Vanderbilt, MIT, the Netherlands\nInstitute for Neuroscience and the University of Western Ontario in Canada \u2014\ncollaborated to gather this trove of brain data from monkeys and people. They\nused devices called multicontact laminar probes to record activity from all\nthe layers of the cortex at once. The probes were surgically embedded in\ndifferent parts of the cortex \u2014 therefore, for the study's human subjects, the\ndevices were implanted in a few people who were undergoing brain surgery for\nepilepsy or movement disorders.\n\n\"Essentially it's just a very micro version of the EEG,\" or\nelectroencephalogram, a way of recording electrical brain activity, Bastos\nsaid. The difference is that EEG most often uses electrodes on the outside of\nthe scalp and thus, through that bone and tissue, it gathers a fuzzier picture\nof the activity happening in all the cortical layers below.\n\nThe universal brain-wave pattern involves gamma waves and alpha-beta waves,\nwhich differ in their frequencies. (Image credit: Science Photo Library -\nPASIEKA via Getty Images)\n\nLaminar probes offer a more high-resolution picture, by comparison. In the\nstudy, the data gathered by the devices was fed into an algorithm of the\nresearchers' design that deciphered the cortical layer from which they came.\n\nIn this way, they uncovered a universal pattern of brain activity that shows\nup throughout the cortex and between species. This pattern is marked by peak\ngamma activity in layers 2 and 3 of the cortex, closer to the skull, and peak\nalpha-beta activity in layers 5 and 6, closer to subcortical regions of the\nbrain. There's also a point of crossover in layer 4.\n\nRelated: How does the brain store memories?\n\nTo check if this pattern popped up in other mammals, the team also looked at\nmouse brains, but the activity seen in the mouse cortex was not the same.\n\nBased on the prior monkey studies, Bastos and colleagues suspect that the\npatterns reflect the same mental process in each primate species, in which the\nslower waves dictate which data enters conscious thought. However, they\nhaven't shown that definitively.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014Why do our brains have folds?\n\n\u20143D map plots human brain-cell 'antennae' in exquisite detail\n\n\u201418 brain studies that blew our minds in 2023\n\nIn the Nature paper, all the primates and humans were resting during the brain\nrecordings, not engaged in a specific task. Future studies could involve\nhaving the subjects perform similar tasks while their brains are scanned; the\nprior monkey research had the animals perform tasks centered around an aspect\nof cognition called working memory, which involves temporarily holding an idea\nor piece of data in your mind so you can use it for a task at hand, for\ninstance.\n\nLooking ahead, the researchers hope to study whether conditions that affect\nthe brain disrupt the universal pattern in measurable ways. Alzheimer's and\nschizophrenia have been connected to abnormal gamma activity in the brain, for\ninstance, so gaining deeper insights into why might help with diagnosis and\ntreatment.\n\nBastos also anticipates that brain-recording technologies will continue to\nadvance in the future, allowing researchers to record tens of thousands of\nneurons in different parts of the brain simultaneously. \"The hope there is\nthat we can begin to understand in a much deeper way what is the neural basis\nof thought, for example,\" Bastos said, \"or what is the neural basis for more\ncomplex types of cognition, which we haven't really been able to touch yet.\"\n\nEver wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why\nfreckles come out in the sun?
