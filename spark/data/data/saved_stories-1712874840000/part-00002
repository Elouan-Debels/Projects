Gitlin - 9/11/2018, 11:35 AM\n\n#### reader comments\n\n105\n\nEnlarge\n\nJonathan Gitlin\n\nWhen the invitation to try out the new formula and sports prototype cars at\nVirginia International Raceway arrived in my inbox, I was pretty sure I'd have\nto politely decline. I could hear the boss' response immediately: \"So, you\njust want to spend a day at the track doing laps?\"\n\nBut this invite stayed on my mind longer than I anticipated. The cars I'd be\ndriving\u2014a Radical SR1 and Ligier Formula 4\u2014both offered something I'd yet to\nreally experience: genuine aerodynamic grip. Maybe there actually was\nsomething to be gained by saying yes. The powers that be seemed to agree, and\nso it was I found myself making the five-and-a-bit-hour drive south from DC in\nthe height of summer, all to find out more about the invisible hand that the\nracing world calls downforce.\n\n## A brief history of aerodynamics\n\nLittle attention was paid to the concept of aerodynamics during the first few\ndecades of the automobile. This is not surprising; although foundational work\nby Bernoulli and Euler dated back to the mid-18th century, any practical\napplications that existed were focused on taking to the skies. When thought\nwas given to the way a car moves through the air, it was in the aid of top\nspeed. If you could lower the amount of drag on a car, you could make it go\nfaster with less horsepower. This practice was exemplified by the streamlined\nbodies given to Grand Prix cars from Auto Union and Mercedes-Benz in the\n1930s, an effort by German industry to boost the precious ego of its Nazi\ndictator.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nThe rest of us ride shotgun: Five automakers who have driven innovation\n\nThe world war that followed taught us much more about aerodynamics, as clever\nminds on all sides tasked themselves with building better warplanes. Even so,\nthat knowledge took even more time to trickle down to the more frivolous\npursuit of making a faster racing car. Malcolm Sayer at Jaguar was a pioneer\nhere, applying his slide rule to the design of the Jaguar C-Type in order to\nwin Le Mans in 1951 and then again in 1953. Still the application of\naerodynamic principles at the time was aimed at cutting drag.\n\nAs cars got faster and faster, that other aerodynamic force that we call lift\nbegan to assert itself (for lift is proportional to speed). That's great if\nyou're sitting in an airplane and want to fly, but it's more of a problem if\nyou're in a car that's trying to slip the surly bonds of earth. A car's tires\nonly have a finite amount of mechanical grip, which has to be split\nlongitudinally (accelerating and braking) and laterally (turning left or\nright). If you start to exert lift upon the car, that decreases the loading on\nthe tires. As the load decreases, so does the total amount of mechanical grip.\nAt best, this results in slower acceleration, longer braking distances, and\nless cornering ability; at worst the driver will simply lose control and\ncrash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith hindsight, the solution was obvious. If an airfoil moving through the air\ngenerates lift, then an inverted airfoil moving through air should generate\nnegative lift. Instead of taking to the sky, a car so equipped should find\nitself pushed down toward the track, which in turn means more traction. A car\nthat generates downforce can therefore corner faster than one that doesn't.\nAnd to make things even better, the faster it goes, the more downforce it\ngenerates.\n\n  * Bernd Rosemeyer driving an Auto Union, c1937-c1938. When attention was paid to aerodynamics, it was to make the cars as low-drag as possible. Rosemeyer set several world speed records for cars of engine capacities of less than 8,000cc in 1937. He was killed in 1938 when, attempting to regain the record from Mercedes, his Auto Union crashed on the Frankfurt-Darmstadt Autobahn at 270mph.\n\nNational Motor Museum/Heritage Images/Getty Image\n\n  * Malcom Sayer, Jaguar's designer, was one of the first to apply aerodynamics to car design in a scientifically rigorous way. The C-Type Jaguar won Le Mans in 1951 and 1953.\n\nJaguar\n\n  * The 1958 Grand Prix of the Netherlands. Formula 1 was eight years old by this point, but any focus of aerodynamics was still aimed at cutting drag, not generating downforce.\n\nBernard Cahier/Getty Images\n\n  * The first iteration of the Porsche 917 suffered terrifyingly dangerous lift at speed.

This is the first known use of downforce-generating wings on a car, but the idea was not picked up again for another 35 years.\n\nGircke/ullstein bild via Getty Image\n\n  * The next time anyone tried using a wing on a racing car was 1966. This is the Chaparral 2E, being raced by its designer Jim Hall at Riverside in California.\n\nThe Enthusiast Network/Getty Images\n\n  * The Lotus 49 was one of the most revolutionary F1 cars in history. But when it first raced in 1967, it\u2014like every other car on the grid\u2014did not have any wings.\n\nBernard Cahier/Getty Images\n\n  * By 1968, the Lotus 49 had sprouted a high wing, as designer Colin Chapman started to adopt the ideas being pioneered by Hall in Texas. But these long spindly supports were as frail as you might probably expect.\n\nGrand Prix Photo/Getty Images\n\n  * The following year, wings were starting to come down in height as more was understood about aerodynamics. Here, Jacky Ickx and his Brabham-Ford BT26A lead Jo Siffert's Lotus-Ford 49B at the Grand Prix of Germany, held at the Nurburgring.\n\nBernard Cahier/Getty Images\n\n  * Fast forward one more year to 1970. Now the Lotus 49's wings were much closer to the body.\n\nBernard Cahier/Getty Images\n\n  * The next step after using wings to generate downforce was to use a shaped underbody and side skirts to create a low pressure underneath the entire car. This was known as the ground effect, and the 1977 Lotus 78 was the first F1 car to really harness it. It would win a lot of races in 1977 and 1978.\n\nBob Harmeyer/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\n  * The 1977 Lotus 79 was an even better ground effect car. This photo gives you a good look at the side skirts that sealed off the underbody airflow.\n\nSteve Powell/Getty Images\n\n  * The first ground effect car predated the Lotus 78 by seven years. Once again it was Jim Hall at Chaparral leading the way. The 2J, driven here by Vic Elford in the Can-Am series, was swiftly banned by the organizers.\n\nFred Enke/The Enthusiast Network/Getty Images\n\n  * The Chaparral 2J sealed off the underbody with lexan side skirts, but Hall took the idea one step further. It also featured a snowmobile engine that powered a pair of fans that sucked air out from underneath the car, further decreasing the air pressure. It generated 2,200lbs (1,000kg) of downforce and could corner at 1.5Gs.\n\nBernard Cahier/Getty Images\n\n  * The next time anyone tried adding a fan to a ground effect car was Gordon Murray's 1978 Brabham BT46B. As with the earlier Chaparral 2J, the other teams lost their minds and Bernie Ecclestone, Brabham's team boss, voluntarily withdrew the car after one race.\n\nBernard Cahier/Getty Images\n\n  * The BT46B used a series of clutches to power the fan by its 3.0L Alfa Romeo flat-12 engine. That means that the downforce increased as the revs and speed rose. The rules said that moveable devices like the fan were ok if they were primarily there for some other purpose, so designer Gordon Murray made sure that a little more than half of the air being sucked in by the fan was from above, into the radiator, allowing Brabham to say (with a mostly straight face) that the fan was there for cooling.\n\nKeystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\n  * Even after ground effects were banned in Formula 1, they continued to be used in sports prototypes like this Porsche 956. People often claim a car with sufficient downforce could drive upside down on the roof of a tunnel, but to my knowledge no one has ever tested this. I think you'd need a very long, very wide diameter tunnel so that the car could gradually climb the banking until it was inverted. What a shame Elon Musk went for a mini tunnel boring machine instead of a massively oversized one that might have let us try this out.\n\nTHOMAS KIENZLE/AFP/Getty Images\n\n  * By most reckoning, it wasn't until 2010 and the Red Bull RB6 that F1 designers had regained the levels of downforce generated by the Lotus 79.\n\nMark Thompson/Getty Images\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nIn fact, the first known car fitted with downforce-generating wings was built\nin 1929, a rocket-powered Opel called the RAK2. But for reasons best known to\nhistory, it took 35 years for anyone to follow up on the idea. For that, we\nhave to thank an innovative Texan named Jim Hall. Hall was a racer and co-\nowner of Chaparral Cars, and he started playing with aerodynamic devices on\nhis cars in the mid-1960s in order to improve their stability at speed. At\nfirst these were moveable spoilers, but in 1966 the Chaparral 2E showed up\nwith a honking great wing mounted on pylons high above the rear deck, and the\nracing world was changed forever.\n\nHall actually gave racing engineers another tool to generate downforce,\nexploiting what's known as the ground effect. Instead of using an inverted\nwing, the entire body of the car can generate downforce by means of side\nskirts and a specially shaped floor (called a venturi) that creates an area of\nnegative pressure underneath it. The most extreme examples of ground effect\ncars are Hall's 1970 Chaparral 2J and Gordon Murray's 1978 Brabham BT46B, both\nof which used fans to further reduce the underbody air pressure. In both\ncases, uproar from their fellow competitors led to the cars being banned (2J)\nor voluntarily withdrawn (BT46B).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven without the trick fans, passive ground effect cars were able to generate\nhuge levels of downforce. In Formula 1, Colin Chapman's Lotus team was the\nfirst to really crack it, and the 1977 Lotus 78 generated about 40 percent\nmore downforce than any other car on the grid. Ground effect cars quickly\nbecame the thing to have, and lap times tumbled as a result.\n\nGenerating downforce with ground effects rather than wings had some other\nbenefits. A ground effect design will create fewer kilograms of drag per kg of\ndownforce than a wing. And it isn't as affected by the turbulent wake of air\nbehind another car, which means the racing can be closer. But there was a\ndownside: if something happened to disrupt the seal that separated the\nunderbody airflow\u2014hitting a bump in the track or damaging a side skirt\u2014the\neffect vanished immediately. There were severe consequences should that happen\nin a corner. F1 banned the practice in 1983, although the prototypes that\nraced at Le Mans and in IMSA continued to use ground effects until the early\n1990s.\n\nAt this point, it would be remiss of me not to note that the advent of\ndownforce in racing hasn't been entirely positive. Cornering speeds have gone\nup and lap times have gone down, but many believe this has happened at a cost\nto the actual racing. This year's IndyCar generates significantly less\ndownforce than it did a year ago, which has made the cars harder to drive but\nadded to the spectacle. And the rule makers of Formula 1 are in a constant\nbattle with the teams to limit the amount of downforce those cars generate.\nBut for now, downforce remains a feature in most of the racing world\u2014including\na few laps for some journalist at Virginia International Raceway.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### Victor Glover raw interview\n\n#### reader comments\n\n105\n\nJonathan M.
