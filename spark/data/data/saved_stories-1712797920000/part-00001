By pinpointing where bitter substances bind to TAS2R14 and understanding\nits activation mechanism, scientists have laid the groundwork for developing\ntreatments that could regulate taste receptors to address conditions like\nobesity and diabetes.\n\nThe study highlights TAS2R14\u2019s unique ability to detect over 100 bitter\nsubstances and the role of cholesterol in facilitating its activation,\noffering exciting possibilities for drug development and providing insights\ninto the receptor\u2019s functions beyond taste perception.\n\nKey Facts:\n\n  1. The structure of the TAS2R14 bitter taste receptor and its activation mechanism by bitter substances have been identified, offering a new understanding of taste perception.\n  2. Cholesterol\u2019s presence in TAS2R14 suggests a pre-activation state that enhances sensitivity to bitter tastes, with implications for the receptor\u2019s role in metabolic regulation.\n  3. Discovering TAS2R14\u2019s expression in the cerebellum, thyroid, and pancreas opens avenues for research into its potential functions outside taste perception and its relevance to metabolic diseases.\n\nSource: UNC Health Care\n\nHumans can sense five different tastes: sour, sweet, umami, bitter, and salty,\nusing specialized sensors on our tongues called taste receptors. Other than\nallowing us to enjoy delicious foods, the sensation of taste allows us to\ndetermine the chemical makeup of food and prevents us from consuming toxic\nsubstances.\n\nResearchers at the UNC School of Medicine, including Bryan Roth, MD, PhD, the\nMichael Hooker Distinguished Professor of Pharmacology, and Yoojoong Kim, PhD,\na postdoctoral researcher in the Roth Lab, recently set out to address one\nvery basic question: \u201cHow exactly do we perceive bitter taste?\u201d\n\nTAS2R14s are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family of bitter\ntaste receptors. Credit: Neuroscience News\n\nA new study, published in Nature, reveals the detailed protein structure of\nthe TAS2R14 bitter taste receptor. In addition to solving the structure of\nthis taste receptor, the researchers were also able to determine where bitter-\ntasting substances bind to TAS2R14 and how they activate them, allowing us to\ntaste bitter substances.\n\n\u201cScientists know very little about the structural make up of sweet, bitter,\nand umami taste receptors,\u201d said Kim.\n\n\u201cUsing a combination of biochemical and computational methods, we now know the\nstructure of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R14 and the mechanisms that\ninitializes the sensation of bitter taste in our tongues.\u201d\n\nThis detailed information is important for discovering and designing drug\ncandidates that can directly regulate taste receptors, with the potential to\ntreat metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.\n\nFrom Chemicals to Electricity to Sensation\n\nTAS2R14s are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family of bitter\ntaste receptors. The receptors are attached to a protein known as a G protein.\nTAS2R14 stands out from the others in its family because it can identify more\nthan 100 distinct substances known as bitter tastants.\n\nResearchers found that when bitter tastants come into contact with TAS2R14\nreceptors, the chemicals wedge themselves into to a specific spot on the\nreceptor called an allosteric site, this causes the protein to change its\nshape, activating the attached G protein.\n\nThis triggers a series of biochemical reactions within the taste receptor\ncell, leading to activation of the receptor, which can then send signals to\ntiny nerve fibers \u2013 through the cranial nerves in the face \u2013 to an area of the\nbrain called the gustatory cortex. It is here where the brain processes and\nperceives the signals as bitterness. And of course, this complex signaling\nsystem occurs almost instantaneously.\n\nCholesterol\u2019s Role in Bitter Taste Reception\n\nWhile working to define its structure, researchers found another unique\nfeature of TAS2R14 \u2013 that cholesterol is giving it a helping hand in its\nactivation.\n\n\u201cCholesterol was residing in another binding site called the orthosteric\npocket in TAS2R14, while the bitter tastant binds to the allosteric site,\u201d\nsaid Kim.\n\n\u201cThrough molecular dynamics simulations, we also found that the cholesterol\nputs the receptor in a semi-active state, so it can be easily activated by the\nbitter tastant.\u201d\n\nBile acids, which are created in the liver, have similar chemical structures\nwith cholesterol. Previous studies have suggested that bile acids can bind and\nactivate TAS2R14, but little is known about how and where they bind in the\nreceptor.\n\nUsing their newfound structure, researchers found that bile acids might be\nbinding to the same orthosteric pocket as cholesterol. While the exact role of\nbile acid or cholesterol in TAS2R14 remains unknown, it may play a role in the\nmetabolism of these substances or in relation to metabolic disorders such as\nobesity or diabetes.\n\nHow This Can Help Drug Development\n\nThe discovery of this novel allosteric binding site for bitter tasting\nsubstances is unique.\n\nThe allosteric binding region is located between TAS2R14 and its coupled G\nprotein is called G-protein alpha. This region is critical to form a signaling\ncomplex, which helps to transfer the signal from the taste receptor to the\nG-protein to the taste receptor cells.\n\n\u201cIn the future, this structure will be key to discovering and designing drug\ncandidates that can directly regulate G proteins through the allosteric\nsites,\u201d said Kim.\n\n\u201cWe also have the ability to affect specific G-protein subtypes, like\nG-protein alpha or G-protein beta, rather than other G-protein pathways that\nwe don\u2019t want to cause any other side effects.\u201d\n\nRoth and Kim have made a number of new discoveries, but some leave more\nquestions than answers. While running a genomics study, they found that the\nTAS2R14 protein in complex with the GI is expressed outside the tongue,\nespecially in the cerebellum in the brain, the thyroid, and the pancreas.\n\nResearchers are planning future studies to elucidate the function these\nproteins may have outside of the mouth.\n\n## About this taste perception and neuroscience research news\n\nAuthor: Kendall Daniels Source: UNC Health Care Contact: Kendall Daniels \u2013 UNC\nHealth Care Image: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\n\nOriginal Research: The findings will appear in Nature\n\nTags\n\nauditory funcitonbitter tastebrain\nresearchGeneticsneurobiologyNeurosciencetaste perceptionUNC Health Care\n\nShareTweetShareShareSubmitEmail\n\nNeuroscience News\n\nNeuroscience News posts science research news from labs, universities,\nhospitals and news departments around the world.
