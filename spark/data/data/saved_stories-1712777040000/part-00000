This study presents a\ncomprehensive review of the application of these technologies for\nmanufacturing electromagnetic devices, offering a categorized analysis based\non different types of additive manufacturing techniques. Each category is\nexamined, and its characteristics are briefly described, highlighting not only\nthe most innovative and significant devices fabricated using specific\ntechnologies, but also identifying their limitations and strengths. Through a\ndual analysis, this paper provides a deep understanding of the potential of\nand challenges associated with using different additive manufacturing\ntechnologies in the design and crafting of electromagnetic components.\nMoreover, this review offers recommendations for future studies, suggesting\nhow the unique features of this new manufacturing paradigm could be further\nleveraged for breakthroughs in the electromagnetic field.\n\nKeywords:\n\nadditive manufacturing; 3D printing; antennas; electromagnetic devices\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nMany perceive additive manufacturing (AM) as a relatively recent production\napproach that has gained prominence in recent years due to the proliferation\nof cost-effective 3D printers. However, this transformative technology had its\norigins back in 1984 when Charles W. Hull introduced his initial patent in\n1986 for a \u201cDevice for producing three-dimensional objects through\nstereolithography\u201d [1]. Initially geared towards rapid prototyping, it enabled\nthe swift and highly cost-effective development of functional models compared\nto the expensive casting molds that were often created multiple times to\nachieve precise designs. Nonetheless, AM faced limitations for final goods\nproduction due to a limited range of printable materials (typically polymers),\nthe suboptimal physical properties of manufactured objects, and the necessity\nfor post-processing to attain an acceptable level of finishing quality. Recent\nyears have witnessed significant changes, driven by both advancements in\nexisting technologies and the expiration of key patents that had hindered its\nwidespread adoption. While AM cannot replace traditional manufacturing for\nmass production, it serves as a disruptive alternative in sectors requiring\nsmall production volumes and a high degree of design customization.\n\nFor instance, the aerospace industry [2,3,4] has harnessed AM\u2019s potential to\ncraft intricate geometries that were previously unattainable, resulting in\nsubstantial weight reductions, enhanced performance, and the ability to repair\ncomplex components, such as combustion chambers and engines. Likewise, in\nbiomedical applications, AM proves invaluable for creating personalized\nmedical devices, a necessity for prosthetics and highly recommended for\ncustomizing monitoring devices, diagnostic tools, and biomedical implants\n[5,6,7]. These are just a few of the most compelling domains to which AM can\nbe directly applied. It also extends to the automotive sector for producing\nreplacement and customized parts, general mechanical engineering for rapidly\nprototyping functional components, and, more recently, exploration in naval\nindustries [8] and civil engineering and architectural design [9].\n\nThe realm of electrical engineering has witnessed a surge in research\nexploring AM in recent years. The incorporation of the third dimension enabled\nby AM offers significant advantages by relaxing the constraints on achievable\nshapes which were previously restricted by conventional manufacturing methods.\nTraditionally, research in antenna design, microwave circuits, and\nelectromagnetic devices predominantly favored two-dimensional configurations\naligned with well-established printed circuit board (PCB) technology. While\nPCB technology has been extensively optimized and matured for mass-producing\ncost-effective consumer electronic devices, AM has become highly attractive\nfor crafting small batches of highly specialized devices, especially in\nvaluable applications. This approach unlocks unique possibilities that\nconventional subtractive technologies cannot match, including fine-tuning\ninternal device structures and customizing material dielectric properties\n[10]. Nonetheless, challenges arise, such as achieving fine details and smooth\nsurfaces becoming more arduous as the frequency increases, especially with\ncommon and cost-effective AM technologies like fused filament fabrication\n(FFF). Additionally, printing both dielectric materials and conductors in a\nsingle manufacturing step remains a significant concern when adopting these\nproduction technologies.\n\nIn this study, a comprehensive review of current advancements in utilizing AM\nfor the development of antennas and EM devices is provided. The literature is\nsystematically categorized based on the specific 3D printing technologies\nemployed for device fabrication. Additionally, a succinct overview of each\ntechnology is given, delineating its principal advantages and limitations.\nThis approach is deemed paramount for facilitating a thorough comprehension of\nthe distinctions and potential inherent in each method. Consequently, in order\nto offer readers a broad perspective on the potential applications of AM in\nEM, concise details on the type of device produced, the technique utilized,\nand the frequency of operation are provided in the summary tables included\nwithin this paper.\n\n## 2\\. Fused Filament Fabrication\n\nFused filament fabrication (FFF), also known as fused deposition modelling\n(FDM^\u00ae commercially owned by Stratasys), is a widely utilized AM technique\nrenowned for its simplicity and versatility. This method is a cornerstone in\nthe realm of 3D printing, offering a practical and accessible means of\nmaterializing intricate designs. At its core, FFF operates on a fundamental\nprinciple reminiscent of a hot glue gun: it extrudes a continuous filament of\nthermoplastic material through a heated nozzle, depositing successive layers\non top of one another to construct a three-dimensional object, as schematized\nin Figure 1a.\n\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the FFF process (a)\u2014Visual\nrepresentation of an FFF printer in action (b).\n\nThe process begins with a computer-generated design, which is divided into\nnumerous thin horizontal cross-sections by using a tool called a \u201cslicer\u201d.\nThis piece of software\u2019s aim is to determine the path that the print head and\nplatform should follow, ensuring the precise deposition of the molten filament\nlayer by layer. As each layer rapidly cools and solidifies, a tangible object\nemerges with a remarkable level of intricacy (see an example in Figure 1b).\nThe level of precision that can be achieved by this technology is in the order\nof 0.1/0.2 mm, depending on the quality of the printer mechanics and the\napplication of the correct printer settings.\n\nThe versatile nature of FFF is evidenced by its cost effectiveness as well as\nits compatibility with an array of thermoplastic materials, making it well\nsuited for various applications spanning rapid prototyping, functional part\nproduction, and even artistic creations. Its straightforward yet effective\napproach, highlighted by the simple yet ingenious filament extrusion process,\nhas firmly established FFF as the most frequently used technology in the ever-\nevolving landscape of AM and fundamental to developing EM devices.\nNevertheless, the constraint represented by the thermoplastic nature of\nprintable materials compels us to use other manufacturing methods to obtain\nelectrically conductive structures, strongly limiting the use of FFF to the\nrealization of dielectric elements or unconventional substrates for antennas\nand microwave devices. Furthermore, the modest dielectric constant exhibited\nby the most common plastic printable filaments, coupled with the additional\nreduction arising from unavoidable interstitial air gaps between the rods\nextruded in the printing process, curtails the feasibility of fabricating\nhighly miniaturized devices. Indeed, the rule of thumb for miniaturized\nantennas is that size is inversely proportional to the square root of the\ndielectric constant of the material used to manufacture the device.\n\nFor all these reasons, during the early stages of implementing FFF to make EM\ndevices, researchers have focused on utilizing standard commercial materials\nto produce unconventional substrates for basic and established antennas, as\nwell as simple enclosures for the EM devices. For example, in [11], the\nauthors employed polylactic acid (PLA) to create a substrate for a four-\nelement planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) aiming to achieve a compact,\ncircularly polarized antenna for a UHF RFID reader. In this case, the\nelectrically conductive components were crafted using a cutting plotter\nmachine, which accurately shaped an adhesive copper tape. Similarly, in [12],\n3D printing was utilized to fabricate a personalized substrate housing a\nfrequency-variable patch antenna controlled by varactor diodes. Here,\nacrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), another prevalent material for FFF, was\nselected for the filament. The conductive portions and connections were\ncreated using aluminum tape and silver epoxy, respectively. In both studies,\nAM played a pivotal role in crafting substrates with unconventional shapes,\nfacilitating the realization of the final devices. Conversely, in [13], the\napplication of AM in prototyping a basic patch antenna brought about an\nenhanced attribute: device flexibility. In this scenario, the authors utilized\na filament called NinjaFlexTM to 3D print a flat yet flexible and stretchable\nsubstrate for a rectangular patch antenna. The radiator, in turn, was\nfashioned using a silver conductive paste.\n\nA different approach was followed in [14], in which PLA was used to make a\ncustomized enclosure to hold a passive UHF RFID sensor tag, designed to be\npart of a wristlet. Unfortunately, this first prototype suffered from the\nlimitation of the material, which is rigid (not particularly comfortable to\nwear) and had a low dielectric constant, resulting in a cumbersome and less\nergonomic device.\n\nNumerous other contributions in the literature center around the design and\ncreation of devices that traditionally undergo subtractive processes such as\nCNC milling and drilling. In these instances, AM offers a distinct advantage\nin terms of cost reduction, manufacturing simplicity, and the flexibility to\nexperiment with intricate geometries. For instance, in [15], a conical horn\nantenna with a dielectric load is completely printed using PLA and\nsubsequently metalized using the electroplating technique. This technique\nconsists of depositing a metal layer onto a surface using an electric current.\nThe object to be plated is immersed in a solution containing metal ions, and\nthe metal ions are attracted to and accumulate on the object\u2019s surface as a\nthin layer. Naturally, for electroplating to occur, the object intended for\nplating must possess electrical conductivity. Therefore, in this scenario, the\n3D-printed component needs to be pre-coated with a conductive paint layer to\nenable the electroplating process. Another possibility is to print a device in\nvarious pieces and then assembly it after a possible postprocessing step. In\nthis regard, in [16], a quad-ridged wideband horn antenna was designed in\npieces to be assembled and printed in PLA. The plastic was then metalized by\nusing a conductive material that uses nickel as a raw material. Despite\ninitial projections that it would reach a proficient level of performance\nspanning the bandwidth between 4 GHz and 13 GHz, the ultimate prototype\nyielded comparatively diminished results. This outcome potentially stemmed\nfrom inherent limitations in the metallic coating efficacy or intricacies\nrelated to the assembly procedure. To overcome this limit, a possible solution\nis that adopted in [17] by the authors who made a long-slot traveling-wave\nantenna (L-STA) by cutting a slot in the side of a WR-28. The structure was\ncrafted from separate PLA components assembled after the application of\naluminum adhesive tape, which ensured the attainment of the requisite\nelectrical conductivity.\n\nHowever, given the evident proclivity of FFF technology towards printing\ndielectric materials, the vast majority of scientific endeavors employing this\ntechnique to create electromagnetic devices are primarily focused on\nfabricating dielectric devices such as lenses, reflectarrays, dielectric\nresonator antennas (DRAs), and dielectric rod antennas. For some of these\ndevices, the combination of the low dielectric constant inherent in commercial\n3D-printable filaments and the ability to adjust the infill of the final\nobject (referring to the proportion of a material utilized to occupy the\ninterior of the printed device) seamlessly aligns with the specific\nrequisites. For example, in [18], the authors employed a 50% infill percentage\nto meet the requirements of two PLA-made lenses applied on top distinct\nantenna arrays, thereby enhancing their gain performance. Conversely, in [19],\na lens was developed to allow for conical beam scanning without moving parts,\nintended for spaceborne wind scatterometry applications. In this case, the\nlens antenna was designed using curved-ray geometrical optics and particle\nswarm optimization for determining the optimal lens surface shapes and\nmaterial distribution, aiming for a design with minimal volume and a\nconsequently reduced mass (mandatory for aerospace applications). The\nresulting material inhomogeneity was achieved by using PLA to print a\nspecifically designed unit cell, repeated to fill the whole lens shape.\nDifferent infill values were used in [20], instead, to make an optimized\ngraded dielectric lens (OGL) composed of seven layers of PLA. Going from the\ncentral element to the outer element, each layer had an infill of 100%, 80%,\n60%, and 30%, respectively, composing a specular structure. As already said,\nin some circumstances, the dielectric constant of common 3D-printable\nmaterials is sufficient for the scope, like in [21], in which a standard ABS\nwas used to make circular cross-sectional dielectric rods, which were\nsubsequently installed on top of four folded dipole slot antennas. However,\nsometimes higher dielectric constants are required. In these cases, some\ncommercial filaments could be used, albeit technical and less easy to print.\nSpecifically, PREPERM^\u00ae is a high-performance dielectric material developed\nand manufactured by Premix, a company specializing in electromagnetic\nmaterials, now the property of Avient [22]. It is designed for various\napplications in the field of radio frequency (RF), microwave, and millimeter-\nwave technologies, and it is also available in spools of filaments with\ndifferent dielectric properties. These filaments can offer interesting values\nin terms of their dielectric constant (nominally ranging from 3 to 12), low\nloss tangent, and stability over a wide range of frequencies. Some of them\nwere used to make miniaturized dielectric rod antennas like in [23], in which\nthe so-called ABS1000 by PREPERM^\u00ae (with a declared dielectric constant of 10)\nfilament was used to build screw-shaped rods used to develop a circularly\npolarized dielectric rod antenna array operating between 4 GHz and 7.5 GHz,\ngreatly reducing its size. On the other hand, in [24], the ABS400 by PREPERM^\u00ae\nwas used in combination with a standard ABS, properly varying the infill of\nboth the materials when they were used to print a gradient index lens\nstructure (GRIN) to focus the beam of a radiating source. This structure was\nthen replicated, with circular symmetry, to develop a wideband multibeam\nantenna array. Reflectarrays are other devices that could greatly benefit from\nFFF 3D printing of these high-performing filaments. In [25], for example, the\nABS1000 was used to make a reflectarray generating an orbital angular momentum\nbeam. The result was obtained by using half-wavelength-high rectangular\nelements, with a metallic background and properly disposed, that shaped the\nreflectarray, which was thought to be working at 30 GHz. Another example of a\nreflectarray is that deeply described in [26], in which the authors used the\nABS1200 by PREPERM^\u00ae to make a much more intricate, although fragile, single-\nelement structure to develop the proposed reflectarray, which allows for the\ntransformation from linear polarization (LP) to dual circular polarization\n(CP) at 34 GHz. DRAs are also another common application for FFF in EM,\nbecause they are essentially constituted by dielectric materials and could\nhave an advantage in that their shape is customizable. In [27], the authors\nused the ABS1200 to develop a low-cost RDRA array for mm wave applications,\nwhile in [28], the ABS1000 was used to make a multi-ring DRA, manually\ndesigning the unit cells for each ring to precisely tailor the effective\ndielectric constant of each layer.\n\nResults like those obtained by using PREPERM filaments can also be achieved by\nusing lab-made filaments, exploiting PLA or ABS as the matrix and barium\ntitanate or other ferroelectric powders as the doping agent. An example of\nthis approach is described in [29], in which a novel design for a wideband and\nlow-profile DRA operating between 2.45 GHz and 3.75 GHz is designed and\ntested. The use of the aforementioned lab-made filaments allows the proposed\nshape to be developed easily while reducing costs and limits related to\ntraditional manufacturing technologies.\n\nFFF represents one of the most important and widespread AM technologies used\nin recent years for prototyping EM devices. Its cost effectiveness and ease of\nuse outweigh drawbacks related to its lack of thermoplastic materials, very\nhigh dielectric constant, and need for post-processing steps to ensure\nelectrical conductivity. Moreover, some new composite materials, including\nmetallic particles inside a polymeric printable matrix [30], promise to be\ngood candidates for crafting fully 3D-printed devices without the need for\nfurther manufacturing steps, as already stated in [31], in which a metasurface\ncavity antenna was crafted using PLA and Electrifi^\u00ae (from Multi3D LLC, Cary,\nNC, USA) for image-sensing purposes. This promising material has been deeply\nstudied by the authors, who evaluated the effective electrical conductivity of\nthe printed material in the microwave range between 0.72 GHz and 6 GHz, as\nstated in [32]. Subsequently, this knowledge has been used in many\ncircumstances to properly simulate intricate antenna designs exploiting\nElectrifi, as for example in [33], in which the development and testing of a\nwideband circular waveguide 3D-printed antenna are described. Table 1\nsummarizes the examined papers\u2019 main information.\n\nTable 1. Comparison of the FFF works examined.\n\n## 3\\. Vat Polymerization Technologies\n\nVat polymerization AM techniques fall within the category of 3D printing\nmethodologies characterized by the selective polymerization of liquid resin\nmaterials in a layer-by-layer fashion to create intricate three-dimensional\nobjects. In this process, a reservoir or vat contains a liquid photopolymer\nresin that undergoes selective curing through the application of light\nsources, such as lasers, projectors, or LEDs. This controlled curing process\nresults in the solidification of the resin, forming the desired object\u2019s\nsuccessive layers. Noteworthy sub-technologies within this category encompass\nstereolithography (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP), both of which rely\non photopolymerization principles to fabricate objects with intricate details\nand smooth surfaces.\n\nThe primary distinction between SLA and DLP lies in their light delivery and\nresin solidification methods, leading to variations in their equipment, speed,\nand overall performance. In SLA, a laser beam precisely traces the object\u2019s\ncross-section onto the liquid resin\u2019s surface, selectively curing it and\nforming a solid layer. Subsequently, the build platform is typically lowered,\nand this process is iterated for subsequent layers until the entire object is\nfabricated. Conversely, DLP employs a digital projector or an LCD high-\nresolution screen to project an entire layer\u2019s image onto the liquid resin\nsimultaneously. This is achieved by utilizing a mask or micro-mirror array to\ncontrol the exposure of each pixel. Consequently, DLP can cure an entire layer\nin a single exposure, generally making it faster than SLA for constructing\nobjects. However, DLP\u2019s accuracy may be marginally lower than that of SLA due\nto the pixelation effect resulting from discrete pixel projection. A\ncomparative representation of the working principles of SLA and DLP is\ndepicted in Figure 2 (the original image is accessible in [34]).\n\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of the DLP and SLA printing process.\n\nBoth SLA and DLP technologies can achieve a high level of precision, up to\n0.01 mm, rendering them suitable for the fabrication of EM devices operating\nat higher frequencies when compared to those created with FFF. This advantage\nis primarily attributed to the smoother surfaces of vat-polymerization-\nproduced components, which facilitate post-processing techniques for\nmetallization. An illustrative example is found in [35], in which a non-planar\ndipole array was 3D printed using SLA with a standard resin, subsequently\nachieving electrical conductivity through electroless plating. Additionally,\nin [36], various RF components such as horn antennas, rectangular waveguides,\nand filters were manufactured using vat polymerization and tested after\nundergoing an electroplating process, with their performance compared to that\nof traditionally manufactured counterparts. In general, the outcomes\ndemonstrated a commendable performance, except in cases in which\ninsufficiently thick conductive coatings resulted in a slight degradation in\nperformance.\n\nNotably, SLA and DLP are also applicable for crafting dielectric elements for\nRF devices. Various types of resins are available, ranging from industrial-\ngrade to flexible variants, although many exhibit slightly higher losses\ncompared to commercially available 3D-printable filaments. Nevertheless,\nobjects produced through vat polymerization tend to be sturdier and robust,\neven when small in size. For instance, FFF-printed reflectarrays with\nintricate geometries may be fragile, and vat polymerization can provide a\nsolution. In [37], the authors employed a flexible resin to create a\ndeployable bi-focal reflectarray inspired by the Japanese concept of Kirigami,\nresulting in a robust yet flexible device that can be unfolded to reduce its\nsize when not in use. In [38], researchers crafted two slotted dielectric\nsubstrates as part of a dual-circularly polarized stacked patch antenna, with\nmetallic layers constructed using copper foil. Vat polymerization can be used\nto develop waveguide junctions, like in [39], in which the authors\ndemonstrated the successful implementation of a compact W-band \u2018Swan Neck\u2019\nturnstile junction orthomode transducer using DLP 3D printing, highlighting\nits reduced volume, efficient performance, and integration with dual-polarized\nantenna systems. In [40,41], vat polymerization was harnessed to manufacture\ndistinct Luneburg lenses (LLs). One was a GRIN lens designed as a cylinder\nwith conductive top and bottom surfaces through the application of copper\nfoil. This structure was also configured to support a similarly printed horn\nantenna, rotated by 45 degrees along the longitudinal axis to direct radiation\ncorrectly through the LL. The other was a 3D LL shaped like a quasi-\nicosahedron, capable of supporting both left-handed circular polarization\n(LHCP) and right-handed circular polarization (RHCP) beams simultaneously,\ndesigned for Ka-band operation. Although dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs)\ncan also be printed via SLA/DLP, this is less common due to the limited\navailability of high-dielectric constant resins, which are typically\nchallenging to print. Nonetheless, conventional commercial resins can serve\nthis purpose in certain situations, as exemplified in [42], in which\nSupershape formulas inspired by Gielis [43] were used to mathematically define\norganic shapes for DRAs operating at 3.6 GHz.\n\nFurthermore, polarizers represent another potential application for vat\npolymerization 3D printing. The high resolution of these technologies enables\nthe creation of structures capable of operating at very high frequencies. In\n[44], for instance, the authors leveraged on the superior geometric\nflexibility of 3D printing, proposing a modified odd-numbered Fresnel lens\ncomprising subwavelength discrete dielectric posts. It was shown that by\nintegrating dielectric anisotropic metamaterial, the modified Fresnel lens\ncould achieve CP radiation fed by a simple linearly polarized LP open-ended\nwaveguide OEWG. Finally, when standard materials are still not sufficient, a\n3D-printing-based approach can still be used by exploiting a specific vat\npolymerization technology named lithography-based ceramics manufacturing (LCM)\n[45]. With this method, it is possible to print resins with a very high\nconcentration of ceramic powder, using a procedure similar to that of DLP.\nAfter printing, in order to produce a pure ceramic device, firing and\nsintering postprocessing is needed. In [46], the authors examine how varying\nsintering temperatures affect the dielectric properties of 3D-printed alumina\n(Al_2O_3) within the W-band frequency range. By adjusting the sintering\ntemperature, the relative permittivity of alumina was adjusted from 4.4 at\n1250 \u00b0C to 9.2 at 1650 \u00b0C, while changes in dielectric losses remained very\nlow. This underscores the adaptability of LCM technology for applications in\nmillimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. Table 2 summarizes the examined\npapers\u2019 main information.\n\nTable 2. Comparison of the SLA/DLP works examined.\n\n## 4\\. High-Energy Laser-Based Technologies\n\nThe forefront technologies in this domain encompass laser powder bed fusion\n(LPBF), direct metal laser sintering (DMLS^\u00ae) [47], selective laser melting\n(SLM), and selective laser sintering (SLS). Despite their relatively higher\ncosts compared to other 3D printing methods, these technologies offer a\ndistinct advantage by enabling the direct manufacturing of components from\nmetallic or ceramic materials, obviating the need for extensive post-\nprocessing. This achievement has positioned these laser-based technologies as\npivotal tools within the electromagnetic device fabrication domain, heralding\na new frontier of possibilities for intricate and high-performance\nelectromagnetic components.\n\nLPBF, DMLS^\u00ae, and SLM operate by harnessing a high-powered laser to\nselectively fuse layers of metallic powder materials onto a build platform\n(Figure 3a). This process enables the realization of components with an\nimpressive mechanical strength, fine details, and a high level of geometrical\naccuracy. On the other hand, SLS employs a similar principle but heats the\nmetal, ceramic, or polymer powder to the point of sintering (Figure 3b),\ncreating solid objects without fully melting the material. While SLS\ncomponents possess a high level of strength and precise details, some post-\nprocessing is typically required to remove excess powder and refine surface\nquality.\n\nFigure 3. Example of metal 3D printing (a)\u2014Example of dielectric SLS 3D\nprinting (b).\n\nThe combined strengths of LPBF, DMLS^\u00ae, SLM, and SLS lie in their capacity to\ndirectly fabricate metallic and dielectric elements with exceptional levels of\nprecision and complexity, eliminating the need for supporting structures (the\nunfused/unsintered powder naturally supports the printed part). While they may\nentail higher initial investments, these technologies have unparalleled\npotential for crafting electromagnetic devices that demand superior levels of\nconductivity, geometrical accuracy, and performance.\n\nIn electromagnetic applications, these laser-based manufacturing technologies\nare invaluable for realizing antennas and intricate geometries in devices that\nrequire a very high electrical conductivity. For instance, in [48], a\nwaveguide slot antenna array consisting of two metallic layers, one containing\nthe waveguides and the other containing the slots, was crafted using DMLS^\u00ae\nand compared with a counterpart manufactured through milling. The former\nachieved a performance that closely aligned with simulations. In [49], the\nprecision of laser technologies was exploited to create various types of\nultrawide-band Vivaldi antenna arrays, complete with various lattices. In the\nsame process, sub-miniature push-on micro (SMPM) male connectors were printed,\nresulting in a final antenna ready for testing. In [50], SLM was employed to\nproduce a log-periodic Koch dipole array from an aluminum alloy, designed to\naccommodate an SMA connector as a feeder. This antenna array was intended to\noperate between 1 GHz and 3.5 GHz, and the measurements closely matched those\nof the simulation results. Additionally, SLS can be used to create full-metal\ndevices, as demonstrated in [51], in which a waveguide 4 \u00d7 4 array antenna was\nmanufactured from aluminum alloy and compared to an identical counterpart\nproduced by CNC milling. The comparison showed that AM technology can be a\nvalid and cost-effective alternative to traditional manufacturing, albeit with\na slightly lower accuracy and manufacturing tolerance. However, SLS differs\nfrom the other mentioned technologies in its ability to sinter dielectric\npowders as well. In [52,53], SLS was used to sinter polymeric powders,\nspecifically PC/ABS in the former and nylon in the latter. These examples\nincluded the construction of a CP wideband antenna using two crossed\nmagnetoelectric dipoles and a monolithically crafted GRIN dielectric-loaded\ndouble-ridged horn antenna. A 50 \u03bcm copper layer was subsequently applied to\nboth antenna structures to provide electrical conductivity. Table 3 summarizes\nthe examined papers\u2019 main information.\n\nTable 3. Comparison of the LPBF/DMLS/SLM/SLS works examined.\n\nLPBF, DMLS, SLM, and SLS technologies represent significant advancements in\nAM, enabling the creation of intricate and precise electromagnetic devices\ndirectly from metal and dielectric materials. Their ability to achieve a high\nlevel of precision and facilitate direct metal printing opens up new\npossibilities. However, it is essential to note that these advancements come\nwith a considerably higher initial investment compared to other techniques.\nMoreover, specialized facilities for both processing and post-processing are\nrequired. While the surface finishing and polishing processes of the produced\ncomponents are improving, they may not yet match the meticulous quality\nattainable through conventional CNC methods.\n\n## 5\\. Material Jetting, Binder Jetting, and Inkjet Printing Technologies\n\nMaterial jetting (MJ) and inkjet printing, along with binder jetting (BJ),\nrepresent AM techniques that employ the deposition of liquid or semi-liquid\nmaterials to construct intricate objects layer by layer. A shared advantage of\nthese techniques lies in their compatibility with a wide array of materials,\nincluding polymers, metals, ceramics, and composite materials. In comparison\nto conventional manufacturing methods and other AM technologies, MJ, inkjet\nprinting, and BJ have distinct merits. These methods are proficient in\nachieving a high level of precision, intricate feature resolution, and the\nfabrication of complex geometries, sometimes without requiring extensive post-\nprocessing. The capability to deposit multiple materials simultaneously, as\nobserved in MJ and inkjet printing, facilitates the creation of functional\ngradients and intricate internal structures. However, each technique adheres\nto its unique operating principles and considerations.\n\nMJ involves controlled droplet deposition from multiple print heads onto a\nplatform, followed by material solidification through UV curing or thermal\nprocesses (refer to Figure 4a [54]). In contrast, inkjet printing ejects tiny\nliquid droplets that cure or dry upon deposition, affording precise control\nover the layer geometry. On the other hand, BJ distinguishes itself with a\nbinding agent that fuses powdered materials, including metals and ceramics, to\nform solid layers (as explained in the schema presented in Figure 4b [55]).\nThis technique offers relatively rapid build times and scalability for\naccommodating larger parts but often necessitates extensive and intricate\npost-processing, involving the sintering of the green part within dedicated\novens to eliminate the binder material.\n\nFigure 4. Example of metal MJ printing (a); Example of BJ printing (b). Arrows\nhighlight moving axes.\n\nNevertheless, all these technologies have been applied to the field of\nadditively manufactured electromagnetic systems in recent years. The initial\ninstances were associated with inkjet printing technologies, which closely\nresemble traditional 2D printing methods. The primary distinction lies in\ntheir ability to print functionalized inks possessing dielectric or conductive\nproperties while accommodating various substrate thicknesses. For instance, in\n[56,57], a well-known Fujifilm Dimatix DMP [58] was used to print both\ndielectric and conductive inks to make different antennas. In the former case,\nit was a patch antenna operating at 2.45 GHz, while in the latter, it was a\nYagi-Uda antenna operating at 2.45 GHz. Both were made on flexible substrates\nand exhibited excellent performance when compared with that of simulations.\n\nThe process of 2D inkjet printing a metallic layer for ensuring conductivity\nwas also employed in [59]. In that study, the researchers elucidated their\napproach to creating a helical antenna embedded onto a pyramidal lens. This\ndesign aimed to amplify the antenna gain by utilizing MJ to fabricate the\nentire structure in a monolithic approach while concurrently employing inkjet\nprinting to metallize the helical structure. MJ was also the chosen\nmanufacturing technology to make a mushroom-like dielectric lens in [60],\nenhancing the performance of a log-periodic antenna array when placed in front\nof it. Conversely, in [61], MJ was used to craft a mm wave slotted antenna\narray, subsequently metalized using a coating technology named JetMetalTM\n[62]. In both examples, the MultiJet Printing system from 3D Systems [63] was\nemployed, capable of printing polymeric, biocompatible materials, as well as\nwax.\n\nAnother technology based on the MJ principle is Aerosol Jet^\u00ae Printing (AJ^\u00aeP)\nfrom Optomec [64]. It allows for the precise printing of very thin layers of\nboth dielectric and highly conductive materials on virtually any surface,\nthanks to a five-axis printing system. This capability has led to intriguing\nresults, such as in [65], in which microwave transmission lines and\ninterconnections were precisely crafted and operated as simulated, reaching up\nto 40 GHz. Moreover, this technology can be combined with other AM techniques\nto customize arbitrarily complex geometries by adding conductive or dielectric\ntraces to them, as exemplified in [66].\n\nAnother proprietary technology that falls under the category of MJ is that\nused by the DragonFly printers, commercialized by Nano Dimension [67]. These\nprinters can produce additively manufactured electronic devices by employing\nboth dielectric and highly conductive materials to create precise designs\ncomparable to standard PCBs. In [68], for instance, this machine was used to\nmanufacture a four-element patch antenna array, fed by microstrip lines\nconnected to the radiating elements through via holes.\n\nAs for BJ, it allows for the creation of green parts made from metal, ceramic,\nor polymeric powders. Typically, to eliminate the binder completely, some\npost-processing involving a high-temperature treatment is required. This was\nthe case in [69,70], in which BJ was used to print 316L stainless-steel\npowder, guaranteeing sufficient electrical conductivity properties (once\nsintered) and a good level of robustness. By using this material, a waveguide\ncavity antenna and some waveguide transmission lines and antennas were made,\nrespectively. Table 4 summarizes the examined papers\u2019 main information.\n\nTable 4. Comparison of the BJ/Inkjet/MJ/miscellaneous works examined.\n\nIn conclusion, MJ, inkjet printing, and BJ exhibit significant strengths in\ntheir ability to work with both dielectric and conductive materials, within a\nsingle manufacturing process. This capability allows us to achieve results\nwith a level of detail that rivals that of traditional manufacturing\ntechnologies. However, it is essential to note that they require costly\nequipment, often hundreds of thousands of euros (EUR), and, at least for BJ,\nfrequently involve lengthy and complex post-processing procedures.\n\n## 6\\. Current Issues and Future Challenges\n\nAs evident from the preceding sections, there exists a multitude of AM\ntechnologies that can be effectively employed in the fabrication of EM\ndevices. Each of these technologies is tailored to work with specific\nmaterials and may be better suited for specific applications, each offering\ndistinct advantages and disadvantages as succinctly summarized in Table 5.\nNonetheless, despite the considerable advancements in these technologies,\nthere are several noteworthy issues and impending challenges that warrant\nattention. Some of these are delineated below.\n\nTable 5. Advantages and disadvantages of different AM technologies.\n\n  * Material Compatibility and Performance\u2014A prominent concern pertains to the development of novel materials suitable for AM processes that exhibit the required electromagnetic properties. Attaining the necessary dielectric, magnetic, or conductive characteristics in printed materials poses a critical challenge. It is imperative to persist in the development of advanced materials precisely tailored for specific electromagnetic applications and for the particular AM technology employed.\n\n  * Multi-material Integration\u2014One of the strengths of AM lies in its capacity to work with multiple materials simultaneously. Nevertheless, effectively integrating dielectric and conductive materials within the same device can be intricate. The development of techniques that seamlessly deal with both these materials is pivotal for the creation of multifunctional electromagnetic devices.\n\n  * Simulation and Modeling\u2014The development of precise models for the efficient simulation of devices created through AM processes can significantly aid in design and optimization endeavors. Ensuring an accurate electromagnetic characterization of material properties is essential for reliably predicting electromagnetic behavior during the design stage.\n\n  * Customization and Design Complexity\u2014AM excels in fabricating complex geometries. Exploiting this capability to fashion custom electromagnetic devices tailored to specific applications is an ongoing area of research. Furthermore, while AM has frequently been employed to replicate established designs, which is a common practice in planar PCB manufacturing technology, harnessing the full potential of the three-dimensional possibilities achievable with AM would represent a multiplier in the attainable results.\n\n  * Cost-effectiveness\u2014As is the case with any technology, cost effectiveness has paramount importance. Research endeavors should focus on diminishing the overall costs associated with AM for electromagnetic devices, encompassing materials, equipment, and time.\n\n## 7\\. Conclusions\n\nAs evident, the exploration of this rundown of examples highlights the diverse\npotential of various AM technologies, each tailored to specific needs and\nchallenges in the domain of electromagnetic device fabrication. FFF stands out\nfor its low cost and ease of use but is limited by its precision and surface\nfinish. Vat polymerization offers a high degree of precision and good level of\nsurface finish but has limited material options. SLS boasts a wide range of\nmaterials and functional parts but comes with high initial costs and rough\nsurface finishes. SLM and DMLP enable direct metal production for critical\napplications but also come with high initial costs and limited material\noptions. MJ provides a high degree of precision and multiple material\npossibilities, albeit with high initial equipment costs and variable part\ncosts. Binder jetting is quick and has multiple material options, though it\nrequires high initial equipment costs and some post-processing. Inkjet\nprinting offers precision and multiple material possibilities but has high\ninitial equipment costs, limited material options, and challenges in handling\nhigh substrates. Lastly, aerosol jet printing is notable for fine electronics\nprinting and its versatility but is constrained by its high initial equipment\ncosts, limited scalability, and variable costs associated with small-scale\nproduction.\n\nThese technologies offer unique combinations of advantages and limitations,\nsuch as cost effectiveness, precision, material ranges, and surface finish\nquality. The critical aspects include the development of materials compatible\nwith AM processes that exhibit necessary electromagnetic properties, an area\nin which, despite the significant progress that has been achieved in the last\nfew years, much more still need to be done. The integration of multiple\nmaterials presents complexities, especially when combining dielectric and\nconductive ones within a single device. Simulation and modeling are vital for\nthe efficient design and optimization of AM devices, ensuring accurate\nelectromagnetic behavior prediction and, for this reason, a proper evaluation\nof the material electromagnetic properties is mandatory for RF engineers.\nAdditionally, AM\u2019s capability to produce complex geometries opens up avenues\nfor customizing electromagnetic devices for specific applications, pushing the\nboundaries beyond traditional planar PCB manufacturing.\n\nCost effectiveness should remain a paramount goal to achieve for all AM\ntechnologies in order to guarantee their usefulness in real scenarios of\nelectromagnetic device production.\n\nIn summary, selecting an AM technology for antenna and RF device development\nhinges on the specific application\u2019s requirements and constraints. This field\nis marked by rapid advancements, with researchers addressing existing\nchallenges and continually expanding the possibilities for electromagnetic\ndevice manufacturing using AM techniques.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis research received no external funding.\n\n## Informed Consent Statement\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Data Availability Statement\n\nNo new data produced during this study.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe author declares no conflict of interest.\n\n## References\n\n  1.
