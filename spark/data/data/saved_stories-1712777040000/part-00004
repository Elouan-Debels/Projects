Stickney\u2019s longtime mayor was in attendance. The\nstated purpose of this invite-only meeting: to educate local leaders about how\nKoppers is a good community partner, and has been for more than a century, and\nhow it aims to be \u201cgood stewards\u201d of the environment.\n\nBut no member of the public \u2014 none of the nearly 150,000 residents of\nStickney, Cicero and Berwyn \u2014 nor any representative of a news organization,\nmajor community organization or state legislator\u2019s office whose district\nincludes the Koppers plant were invited or made aware of the meeting.\n\nIn fact, the only reason that news organizations, along with legislators,\ncommunity groups and the public, found out about the meetings of the Koppers\nCommunity Advisory Panel are through repeated Illinois Freedom of Information\nAct requests.\n\nThis winter, a series of news articles published by the Cicero Independiente\nand MuckRock explored air pollution near one of Koppers\u2019 most profitable\nplants \u2014 a 36-acre coal tar facility built in 1922 outside Chicago, situated\nbetween two densely-populated communities, Cicero and Stickney. It laid bare\nseveral unflattering environmental and public-health issues, with Koppers at\nthe center of it.\n\nDue partially to air pollution from more than a dozen industrial facilities,\nCicero has some of the worst air quality in Cook County, which already is one\nof the most polluted urban areas in the United States. Some of the area\u2019s\ncensus tracts have among the highest excess cancer rates from exposure to\nindustrial air pollution in the country.\n\nThe January meeting, along with one held in mid-November and another planned\nfor April 11, represent Koppers\u2019 behind-the-scenes effort to shape the\nopinions of regional decision-makers, mostly behind closed doors.\n\nFor most of the January meeting, Koppers and some of the community panelists\nin attendance blasted the MuckRock and Independiente article, meeting minutes\nshow, most of whom were unnamed.\n\nOne attendee called the article an \u201cinjustice to Koppers.\u201d\n\nOne said the article was \u201cbiased.\u201d\n\nAnd one said it was an \u201cunfair shake,\u201d representing \u201cone person\u2019s view.\u201d\u2018\n\nThe Koppers community panel doubles as a legitimate, quasi-governmental body.\nIn reality, it\u2019s a corporate lobbying effort, walled off from the larger\ncommunity, stacked with friendly faces and separated from the disclosure and\naccess requirements of official public government bodies.\n\nAfter MuckRock and the Independiente sent a list of questions to the village\nof Stickney, Koppers and the company\u2019s public-relations consultant, the\nvillage\u2019s outside attorney, Jessica R. Fese of Del Gado Law Group, said that,\n\u201cin the best interests of the Village,\u201d public employees would no longer\nattend company-sponsored meetings.\n\n\u201cVillage officials understood the luncheons to be informational in nature, and\nafter review of the matter, the Village will not be participating in any\nfuture sessions of this type hosted by Koppers,\u201d Fese said in the statement.\n\nIn a separate statement, the village\u2019s clerk, Audrey McAdams, defended the\npractice of officials attending the Koppers meetings. \u201cWhen a person is an\nelected official, they are ambassadors to the community,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe also said that \u201call the people representing Koppers at the meetings are\ncordial and sincere. I personally was seated next to Kevin Washington [Koppers\nvice president of external relations] at the November meeting. I appreciated\nhis passion to disseminate Kopper\u2019s importance to the world in general. Did\nyou know that one of their recycling products actually makes the IV bags you\nwill use at some time in your life?\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Koppers recycles some of its chemicals for medical uses,\nsuch as coal tar concentrations for the treatment of skin rashes and\npsoriasis, the company\u2019s biggest and most profitable products, by far, are\ntreated lumber for homes, utility poles and wooden railroad \u201ccrossties\u201d along\nwith the chemical used to treat and preserve the wood \u2014 creosote, which is\nprocessed from coal tar at the Stickney plant. In the company\u2019s most recent\nannual report, Koppers claims to be the \u201clargest global supplier of creosote\nto the North American railroad industry.\u201d\n\nIn response to this story, Koppers didn\u2019t address specific questions and\nconcerns raised by community groups and elected officials but, in response,\nsaid in a statement that its Stickney plant has \u201cengaged in community outreach\nover many years, interacting with a range of community members and\norganizations. While the global pandemic interrupted our efforts, we purposely\nrestarted renewing neighbor relationships in early 2023, as facility\nleadership and other company representatives welcome these opportunities.\u201d\n\n\u2018Are alarm bells going off?\u2019\n\nKoppers has a spotty environmental record with the Illinois Environmental\nProtection Agency, dating back 50 years, and new alleged violations of\nenvironmental laws that have made their way to the state attorney general\u2019s\noffice.\n\nTo manage the fallout and answer community concerns about our findings,\nKoppers hired a public-relations firm, Mary Ann Green Communications of West\nVirginia. That PR firm\u2019s stated goal, gleaned from emails obtained through an\nIllinois Freedom of Information Act request, was simple: Leverage Koppers\u2019\ndecades of good will among a group of local leaders and create a new, hand-\nselected community board.\n\nThe bylaws of the Koppers Community Advisory Panel state that, among its\nobjectives, is to \u201cprovide feedback and input from the community and plant\noperations and concerns\u201d and to \u201cprovide information to the community from the\nplant,\u201d along with addressing \u201crelated community/industry issues.\u201d\n\nIt pledges that the makeup of the panel will \u201crepresent a cross section of the\ncommunity\u201d and says that \u201call meetings are open to the public.\u201d But that\nincludes a substantial caveat: Guests have to be identified to Green no later\nthan 36 hours before the start of a meeting and any meeting can go into\n\u201cexecutive session\u201d at any time, which expressly excludes visitors. \u201cEither\nall or part of a CAP meeting may be held in executive session,\u201d the bylaws\nread.\n\nThis runs counter to how executive sessions are employed in Illinois public\nmeetings.\n\nWhile the Koppers Community Advisory Panel\u2019s comments about our news\ninvestigation failed to question any of our underlying reporting, data or\nanalysis, the lightly-transcribed minutes show the group made several false,\ninaccurate and misleading statements with clear policy and public health\nimplications.\n\nIn the process of reporting and fact-checking the story, MuckRock and the\nIndependiente requested comment from Koppers in late November, providing its\nvice president of external relations, Kevin Washington, with 12 bulleted\nfindings and six numbered questions in advance of publication. In response,\nthe company provided a 254-word generally-worded statement about its\noperations that largely avoided direct comment on any of our six questions.\n\nIn our report, we directly quoted 84 words of their statement, and provided\nthe entire statement as an embedded element via DocumentCloud. Despite this,\nWashington inaccurately and misleadingly characterized our report as having\nused \u201cvery little of what Koppers shared as its statement, he explained.\u201d\n\nMany of the comments bulleted in the meeting minutes are unnamed. One is not:\nVillage Trustee Lea Torres is quoted as saying that \u201cthere has been such an\nimprovement at the plant. She noted safety and controls are much better. She\nsaid that fact (sic} that the article went back so far in history was wrong.\nLea explained that she follows Koppers and feels confident in its safety in\nhow the plant is run now.\u201d In reality, the investigation focused primarily on\nIllinois EPA violations since 2020, including the 2022 to 2023 period.\n\nWhen we reached out to Torres for further clarification and comment for a\nforthcoming article, she declined further comment.\n\nConversely, other comments expressed genuine concern about the environmental\nand public health findings from some of the panelists:\n\n\u201cDoes this really go on?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre alarm bells going off?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have interest in this stuff and the health impact from pollutants.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did Koppers address the violation?\u201d\n\nThe responses underscore the lack of visible and clear public access to the\nKoppers meetings and is a clear departure from the spirit of the Illinois\nFreedom of Information Act and the Open Meetings Act, whose purpose is to\npromote \u201cfree and open communication between government and citizens,\u201d experts\nsay.\n\nBut legal experts also largely agree that a loophole in state law regarding\ncompany-created meetings exists: the state General Assembly and Illinois\ncourts have made it difficult to apply the Open Meetings Act to private\nentities with significant representation by public officials, even when they\nare discussing matters of public concern, said Matt Topic, a media and\nintellectual property attorney and partner at Loevy & Loevy.\n\n\u201cTypically, unless a private entity is controlled on a day-to-day basis by the\ngovernment, [the Open Meetings Act] generally does not apply,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Who are they hiding it from?\u2019\n\nSeveral community organizations and elected officials in the region have said\nthey would have attended the meeting if alerted to its very existence. These\nofficials and organizations include the offices of the districts where Koppers\nis located, state Rep. Abdelnasser Rashid and state Sen. Javier Cervantes,\nDeputy Majority Leader Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez; and Coraz\u00f3n Community\nServices, a community nonprofit formed in 2003 to serve \u201cthe Latinx community\nand others in the Cicero/Berwyn area by means of effective, life-improving\nprograms.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s especially problematic for Cicero, community members say, as the town\nof about 85,000 is 88% Hispanic.\n\n\u201cAny community meeting impacting thousands of residents that are poorly\noutreached is a failure of the entities,\u201d said Esteban Rodriguez, Coraz\u00f3n\u2019s\nexecutive director. \u201cMy reaction is like many: Upset, anger, frustrated that\nthese types of meetings are held under the radar. Makes me think what are they\nhiding? Who are they hiding it from?\u201d\n\nInstead, the unusual nature of a company-sponsored community panel \u2014 with a\nhand-selected group of friendly, and indebted, Village officials and,\nseparately, organizations primarily working outside of the Cicero and Stickney\ncommunities \u2014 reflect a profound disconnect between the very idea of a\n\u201ccommunity panel\u201d and the communities which it endeavors to serve, community\nmembers say.\n\nThe few panelists that attended the meetings were recruited through word-of-\nmouth referrals and the only regular, non-Village or Koppers members are a\nretired Berwyn principal and two staffers from the Academy for Global\nCitizenship and Cultivate Collective, which are linked financially together,\nand describes itself on its website as a \u201cChicago Public School incubator of\neducational innovation, and teacher training institute.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what, if any, connection a public charter school on the Southwest\nSide of Chicago has to the Cook County communities of Cicero, Stickney and\nBerwyn, which are outside Chicago city limits.\n\nOther potential Koppers Community Advisory Panel members were invited to the\nmeetings but ultimately chose not to participate, largely because they didn\u2019t\nknow what the meetings were about or didn\u2019t trust the non-governmental\norganizer. They include Cook County\u2019s Emergency Management Regional Security\nagency; the University of Illinois\u2019 Extension program in Cook County; and\nMorton College, which is located near the Koppers plant.\n\nJohn Daniel, regional coordinator for Cook County\u2019s Emergency Management\nRegional Security agency, said by email that when he \u201csaw [the meeting\ninvitation] was from a private entity,\u201d he chose not to participate. \u201cMy job\nis working with police, fire chiefs, public works and sometimes elected\nofficials. So, as such, I chose not to attend.\u201d\n\nGina Torres, a career services coordinator at Morton College, which is located\nnext to the plant, said she was invited to the meetings and met virtually with\nthe Koppers public relations consultant, Mary Green. The consultant told\nTorres that Koppers \u201cwas looking to connect with the community and its local\norganizations.\u201d But when asked by the consultant about whether she knew what\nKoppers was, Torres said no, and ended up not attending the meetings.\n\nStickney\u2019s public health department was invited but its director said the\ncommunity panel was the first time he had heard from the Koppers plant. \u201cI\nhave no relationship with Koppers. This is the first time they have contacted\nus,\u201d said Christopher Grunow, Stickney\u2019s top public health official. He\nconfirmed he attended one meeting.\n\nState legislators say they are working to learn more about Koppers. Cervantes,\nthe state senator whose district includes the Koppers plant, has sent the\ncompany a letter following the Independiente and MuckRock investigation,\nrequesting details on operational safeguards.\n\n\u201cLocal residents must have the peace of mind that they are safe from dangerous\nchemicals,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRashid said his office is reviewing the Illinois EPA findings and he is\ncommitted to \u201censure that public health is protected and bad corporate actors\nare held accountable,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI will continue to prioritize\nthe health and safety of our community.\u201d\n\nHernandez, the Illinois House deputy majority leader, said \u201cthese panel\ndiscussions do not change the fact that I continue to be open to genuine\nconcerns about pressing public health frustrations.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWhile our legislative process continues to take shape, companies\nthat disregard the basic health and wellbeing of vulnerable communities\nabsolutely need to be addressed.\u201d\n\nVillage of Stickney officials have repeatedly made their close connections to\nKoppers clear, in emails obtained through our Illinois FOIA requests.\n\nMuckRock filed its first FOIA request regarding Koppers with the Stickney\nVillage Clerk\u2019s office in late November, requesting a range of most publicly-\navailable records, including meeting minutes, violation notices and any\nresults of a previous FOIA request filed by a different requestor.\n\nThis request appears to have triggered a flag by the Village of Stickney to\nKoppers. In its January meeting, Washington of Koppers \u201cexplained the\ncompany\u2019s awareness of the story started with the FOIA to the Village Clerk.\nHe said he appreciated her letting him know about the request.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why McAdams alerted Koppers, other than to share information with\na company that McAdams describes, in that very same meeting, as \u201cintegrated\nand part of Stickney.\u201d\n\nIn a November response to Koppers\u2019 business luncheon invitation, Village Clerk\nAudrey McAdams wrote to Stickney Mayor Jeff Walik: \u201cIf I am able, I plan on\ngoing (to the meeting). Koppers does a lot to support Stickney. I don\u2019t want\nto snub them. If you are not going, do you have anything I should or shouldn\u2019t\nshare?\u201d\n\nLater, at a January Village council meeting, McAdams remarked how \u201cStickney\nhas had an exceptionally long relationship with Koppers, and it is a good\nrapport for us to have this level of input.\u201d\n\nSupport for this project came from the Data-Driven Reporting Project, which is\nfunded by the Google News Initiative in partnership with Northwestern\nUniversity\u2019s Medill School of Journalism; the Rita Allen Foundation; the Reva\nand David Logan Foundation; the Healthy Communities Foundation; and the Donald\nW.
