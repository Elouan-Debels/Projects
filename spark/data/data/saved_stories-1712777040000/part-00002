Well, in 2024, it\u2019s possible that we may\nfinally get a strong federal privacy law.\n\nThe FTC Just Prescribed a Can of Whoop Ass on Health Data\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nview video\n\nThe FTC Just Prescribed a Can of Whoop Ass on Health Data\n\nI\u2019ll say it again: It\u2019s possible. It\u2019s also technically possible that frogs\ncould rain from the sky over lower Manhattan, coating New Yorkers in a spring\nshower of amphibious guts, but is that actually likely to happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe American Privacy Rights Act of 2024, recently introduced by Cathy McMorris\nRodgers (R-WA) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA), would create basic digital privacy\nprotections for Americans. The law, if enacted, would create a variety of\nprotections and rights for consumers, including the ability to access,\ncontrol, and delete information collected by companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile that may sound like a good thing, there\u2019s one aspect of the legislation\nthat privacy advocates seem concerned about. The proposed law would eliminate\npotentially stronger, state-level protections that currently exist. While\nprivacy rights groups remain cautiously optimistic about the APRA\u2019s potential,\nthey are also wary of its proposed preemption of state laws. If the currently\nproposed regulations look strong, the legislative process is just beginning\nand there\u2019s no telling what the federal law may look like after what is sure\nto be a long, combative policymaking process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at what the legislation currently promises, and what\nprivacy advocates are saying about it.\n\n### The right to access, control, and delete\n\nThe American Privacy Rights Act would create broad protections for Americans\u2019\ndata, giving consumers the ability to access, control, and delete data covered\nby the legislation. The policy would give all Americans the power to request\ninformation from entities that have collected data about them. Businesses that\nfall under the law would need to comply with consumers\u2019 requests within\n\u201cspecified timeframes,\u201d the bill states. The bill allows certain exemptions\nfrom these mandates, including small businesses (which are defined as\ncompanies making \u201c$40,000,000 or less in annual revenue\u201d or that collect,\nprocess, retain, or transfer \u201cthe covered data of 200,000 or fewer\nindividuals\u201d), as well as governments, and \u201centities working on behalf of\ngovernments.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Data minimization\n\nThe bill would also mandate something called \u201cdata minimization.\u201d The idea\nhere is to reduce the overall amount of information that companies can collect\nabout web users. Bill backers say that companies covered by the legislative\nwill not be able to \u201ccollect, process, retain, or transfer data beyond what is\nnecessary, proportionate, or limited to provide or maintain a product or\nservice requested by an individual, or provide a communication reasonably\nanticipated in the context of the relationship, or a permitted purpose.\u201d\nAgain, while that sounds good, the devil is in the details here, and it\u2019s not\ntotally clear yet what this sort of data minimization would look like in real\nlife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### What is covered data?\n\nThe bill defines the data covered by the legislation as follows:\n\n> ...information that identifies or is linked or reasonably linkable to an\n> individual or device. It does not include de-identified data, employee data,\n> publicly available information, inferences made from multiple sources of\n> publicly available information that do not meet the definition of sensitive\n> covered data and are not combined with covered data, and information in a\n> library, archive, or museum collection subject to specific limitations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Empowering the FTC\n\nEnforcement of the law would take place at both the federal and state levels.\nMost notably, the Federal Trade Commission would be tasked with developing\nregulations and technical specifications for a \u201ccentralized mechanism for\nindividuals to exercise\u201d their opt-out rights, as well as other technical\nissues surrounding the execution of the legislation, the bill states. At the\nsame time, the bill gives authority to \u201cState attorneys general, chief\nconsumer protection officers, and other officers of a State in Federal\ndistrict court\u201d to pursue enforcement actions against companies that violate\nthe law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Taking aim at the data broker industry\n\nThe bill also targets data brokers. Under the new legislation, the FTC would\nbe mandated to establish a data broker registry that could be used by\nconsumers to identify which companies are brokers and to opt out of data\ncollection by those firms. All data brokers that collect data on more than\n5,000 people would be forced to re-register with the federal registry every\nyear. At the same time, brokers would also be forced to maintain their own\nwebsites that identify them as data brokers and include a tool for consumers\nto opt out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Private right of action\n\nA longstanding desire for privacy advocates has been a private right of\naction\u2014which is a mechanism allowing individual consumers to sue companies\nthat have violated their rights. A number of state privacy laws have failed to\ninclude this. Under the current version of the APRA, consumers would be given\na private right of action, allowing them to file litigation against companies\nthat have demonstrably violated their digital privacy rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Privacy advocates remain cautiously optimistic\n\nGiven years of inaction on privacy policy by federal regulators, state\ngovernments have passed a number of strong privacy laws over the past decade.\nSome of those laws, like California\u2019s CCPA, have been quite strong. The newly\nproposed federal law openly acknowledges that it would eliminate \u201cthe existing\npatchwork of state comprehensive data privacy laws\u201d and establish in its place\n\u201crobust enforcement mechanisms to hold violators accountable.\u201d The fact that\nthe APRA would pre-empt state laws worries some privacy advocates who fear the\npotential for a watered-down federal law. The fact that the APRA may seem\nstrong now doesn\u2019t mean much, since it could easily be neutered by lobbyists\nduring the legislative process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaitriona Fitzgerald, the deputy director at the Electronic Privacy\nInformation Center, said that the federal law\u2019s preemption of state-level\nregulation is only appropriate if it ends up being a strong law. \u201cFrom our\nperspective\u2014in an ideal world\u2014it would not preempt state laws, it would allow\nstates to pass stronger laws,\u201d said Fitzgerald. \u201cWe recognize that compromise\nis necessary and that this is a big sticking point. If it\u2019s going to preempt\nstate laws, it needs to be stronger than existing state laws and regulations.\nWe\u2019re still evaluating the bill to determine whether that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nOther privacy advocates, like the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project\n(STOP), expressed similar concerns. \u201cThe ADPPA does offer strong privacy\nprotections, especially data minimization rules,\u201d said STOP Communications\nDirector Will Owen. \u201cBut the bill falls short by preempting states from taking\neven stronger action, should they so choose. Worst of all, the ADPPA preempts\nstates from enforcing protections, leaving it solely up to the U.S. executive\nbranch, which has been fickle in enforcing Americans\u2019 privacy rights.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCody Venzke, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, said his organization remained\n\u201cconcerned this bill\u2019s broad preemption of state laws will freeze our ability\nto respond to evolving challenges posed by technology.\u201d\n\n", "frontpage": false}
