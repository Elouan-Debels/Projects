From the user\u2019s perspective, you use SSH\nas normal\u2014authenticating with Tailscale according to configurable rules\u2014and we\nhandle SSO, MFA, and key rotation, and allow you to enforce precise\npermissions in ACLs. Combined with other enterprise features like user and\ngroup provisioning with SCIM, you can use Tailscale SSH to craft a fully zero-\ntrust remote access solution.\n\nThanks to that flexibility and strong security-by-default, Tailscale SSH has\nalready become a key component of many of our users\u2019 workflows, including as a\nfoundational piece of enterprise ZTNA strategies. With no additional hardware\nor firewall rules to manage, it\u2019s basically a drop-in upgrade for\nubiquitous\u2014and sometimes somewhat fiddly\u2014SSH processes.\n\nWe\u2019ve got more conceptual background on how Tailscale SSH works, and what\nmotivated us to release it, in its original launch post. You may also be\ninterested in the tutorial video we recently published as part of our\nTailscale Explained video series:\n\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot from the Beta period of Tailscale SSH, and built up\nfeatures alongside it, so today it\u2019s entering a much more robust ecosystem of\ntooling than when we first launched in 2022. Some highlights include:\n\n  * We released the Tailscale SSH Console, allowing designated users to create browser-based SSH sessions to nodes on their tailnet\n  * We added support for remote port forwarding and SELinux\n  * We launched session recording for Tailscale SSH, enabling teams to meet compliance requirements and monitor SSH sessions across their tailnet without needing to trust a third party with their session data\u2014including us.\n  * We built our VS Code extension, which allows you to edit remote files on nodes across your tailnet, on top of Tailscale SSH\n\nIf you\u2019re already using SSH for remote access, but haven\u2019t yet gotten started\nwith Tailscale SSH, there\u2019s no time like the present. It is available today on\nour Personal, Premium, and Enterprise plans.\n\n## Subscribe to Tailscale\u2019s blog\n\nWe have a deep commitment to keeping your data safe.\n\nToo much email?RSSX\n\n## More articles\n\nApr 11, 2024\n\n#### Remotely access Home Assistant via Tailscale for free\n\nAlex Kretzschmar\n\nMar 29, 2024\n\n#### About the Tailscale.com outage on March 7, 2024\n\nParker Higgins\n\nMar 14, 2024\n\n#### Better enterprise security with Tailscale\n\nJairo Camacho\n\n## Try Tailscale for free\n\nGet started\n\nSchedule a demo\n\nContact sales\n\nProduct\n\nHow it worksPricingIntegrationsFeaturesCompare Tailscale\n\nUse Cases\n\nBusiness VPNRemote AccessSite-to-Site NetworkingHomelabEnterprise\n\nResources\n\nBlogEvents & Webinars\n\nCompany\n\nCompanyCareersPress\n\nHelp & Support\n\nSupportSalesSecurityLegalOpen SourceChangelog\n\nLearn\n\nSSH keysDocker SSHDevSecOpsMulticloudNAT TraversalMagicDNSPAMPoLPAll articles\n\nTerms of ServicePrivacy Policy\n\nWireGuard is a registered trademark of Jason A.
