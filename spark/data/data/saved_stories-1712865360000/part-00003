What do you do to people who try to spam using your service?\n\n## Answers\n\n  1. What is the NearlyFreeSpeech.NET policy on accepting email?\n\nNearlyFreeSpeech.NET mail servers accept mail from properly-configured servers\nadministered in accordance with Internet standards and best current practices\nfor mail and DNS that are not listed in one of the blackhole lists we use.\nEmail is accepted only for NearlyFreeSpeech.NET personnel and systems, and for\nNearlyFreeSpeech.NET members who have domains with email forwarding enabled.\n\nAccepting email from broken servers facilitates spam by making it more\ndifficult to tell a spam forgery from an otherwise-legitimate message sent by\na misconfigured server. It makes it easier for viruses to propagate rapidly.\n\nAccepting email from broken servers also encourages system administrators to\nneglect email server maintenance. Maintaining a \"whitelist\" of \"broken servers\nrun by people we mustn't impose upon to fix them\" is even worse; it serves to\nshift the burden created by a broken server from the person who is (supposed\nto be) responsible for that server to every conscientious mail server operator\nin the world.\n\nIn short, accepting email from broken servers harms the Internet, and\nNearlyFreeSpeech.NET does not do things that harm the Internet. Therefore we\ncannot accept email from broken servers.\n\n  2. Why is this page called \"Stop Helping Spammers!?\"\n\nWould you open this email?\n\nFrom: Evil Spammer <liar@criminal-enterprise.com> To: You\n<you@youraddress.com> Subject: I would like to rip you off.\n\nOf course not. You'd delete it on sight, but only if your anti-spam software\ndidn't get to it first.\n\nSpammers know that. They may be duplicitous, lying cheats, but they aren't\n(all) stupid.\n\nThey know that nobody wants to read the junk they pump out.\n\nThey know that they have to trick you into reading it.\n\nThey know they have to trick your anti-spam software into letting you read it.\n\nThey know that they have to hide their tracks, because once people figure out\nwhere they're sending it from, they'll be kicked off and have to start over\nsomewhere else.\n\nThat's why the lies in spam emails start long before the sales pitch in the\nbody of the message. When a spammer connects to the email server that handles\nyour mail, they lie about who they are and where they are. They pick\nlegitimate domains at random and pretend to be part of them. They connect\nthrough networks of virus-infected PCs to mask their origin.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, does it? Surely we can figure that out, right?\nAll this fancy Internet security and nobody's servers can figure out if an\nincoming message is a fake?\n\nNo, many servers can't. It's not that the means to do so do not exist; they\ndo. There are detailed checks that can be used to determine if a particular\nmessage is legitimate or not to a very high degree of accuracy. It's just that\nthey've been turned off.\n\nYou see, there are many misconfigured email servers out there on the Internet.\nFor one reason or another, their email doesn't \"look right\" when it gets where\nit's going. If their emails get checked, they won't pass.\n\nThat means that when there's a problem, there are two ways to make it go away.\nOne is to fix it. The other is to try to get everyone to ignore the problem.\nFor a long time, plan B was the more popular, simply because it's a little\neasier. The result is a big gray area that spammers exploit to conceal their\nidentity. How do you tell a message that's not legitimate by accident from one\nthat's fake on purpose? You can't.\n\nTogether, creating an environment where checks on the legitimacy of email are\nunpopular and allowing broken servers to flourish are directly responsible for\nempowering spammers to choke all of our Inboxes with unwanted garbage.\n\nThat's why we do use every legitimacy check at our disposal on every email\nmessage we process. That's why we insist that the email we process be\ndemonstrably legitimate. And that's why we exhort everyone who sends or\naccepts illegitimate email, \"Stop helping spammers!\"\n\n  3. I'm a member of your service, and I really need to get mail from somebody, but it got blocked. What do I do?\n\nFirst, please understand that such messages never arrive at our servers and\nconsequently there is nothing we can do to recover them.\n\nIf you are a subscription member, you can contact us with the approximate time\na message that bounced was sent (and please don't forget to include the time\nzone) and the email address of the person who sent it to you. If you aren't a\nsubscription member, you can try asking on our forum, providing the same\ninformation.\n\nThe more info you can give us, the better. It's best if you can provide a copy\nof the bounced message, which usually explains the exact problem, or have the\naffected person forward it to us at support@NearlyFreeSpeech.NET.\n\nAlso, the sooner you let us know about the problem, the better; we only keep\nthe relevant logs for about a week, so we won't be able to look into anything\nolder than that.\n\nWe won't fix the problem; we can't. But in some cases we can do some basic\ninvestigation, then figure out who to contact at the organization responsible\nand let them know. About 9 out of 10 times, they fix the problem, often within\nan hour or two. The tenth place doesn't care if you get their email or not, so\nin those cases you'll have to make some other arrangement to get mail from\nthem.\n\n  4. How come the person emailing me claims that this never happens to them when they email someone else?\n\nIt does; it happens all the time and they don't know it. Many servers just\nsilently discard such email or refile it into \"Spam\" folders alongside\nhundreds of other junk messages. That forces them to constantly wonder what\nhappened to any given message. The only thing we do that is unusual is to\nimmediately and \"loudly\" refuse the message so they can see there is a hidden\nproblem making their email service unreliable.\n\n  5. What error messages indicate that this happened to me?\n\nHere is a list of the most common errors and a brief explanation of each:\n\n     * 450 <your.example.com>: Helo command rejected: Host not found\n\nThe name your mail server gives in its EHLO/HELO must exist and be valid.\n\n     * 450 <user@example.com>: Sender address rejected: Domain not found\n\nYou can't send email through our server from a domain that doesn't exist.\n\n     * 504 <10.11.12.13>: Helo command rejected: need fully-qualified hostname\n\nYou sent your IP address in an EHLO/HELO command. Viruses and spammers do this\nall day long, thousands of times per server per hour. Half the time they even\nlie and try to tell us they're on our own network. (Won't work.) They even try\nto tell the server they're connected to that it's talking to itself! (Still\nwon't work.) Although using an IP address in the HELO field is technically\nallowed by the SMTP standard, it's intended for use between email clients and\nemail servers only, not between two email servers.\n\n     * 504 <something>: Helo command rejected: need fully-qualified hostname\n\nJust like it says, the server needs to send a fully-qualified hostname, not\nwhatever thing you sent. RFC 821 says that a server should send its exact\nhostname so that if subsequent delivery attempts fail, the server can be\nprecisely identified and/or notification can be sent back to the appropriate\nparty.\n\nThis can also happen if you point your Windows email client directly at our\nmail server, thinking you'll use it to relay mail to all your friends. Ain't\nhappening.\n\n     * 550 Client host rejected: cannot find your hostname, [10.11.12.13]\n\nYour mail server does not have working reverse DNS.\n\n     * 554 Service unavailable; Client host [10.11.12.13] blocked using ...\n\nYour server is listed in one of the real-time blackhole lists we consult.\nContact the list operator for further assistance. Come on, they gave you a URL\nand everything.\n\nNote that the 4xx errors mean \"try again later\" and the 5xx codes mean that\nthe failure is permanent. We use 4xx errors when we can't tell whether the\nproblem is a temporary DNS glitch or a real DNS problem. The 4xx code tells\nyour server to try again a little later in case the glitch has gone away or\nthe DNS problem has been fixed. (Hint, hint.)\n\n  6. Why don't you send back easy-to-read error messages?\n\nThere are two primary reasons why the error messages generated by our policies\nare not clearer and easier to read.\n\nFirst, the email software we use does not currently allow the errors it\ngenerates to be customized. Therefore, the error text it creates is accurate,\nbut somewhat terse.\n\nSecond, we do not generate the message containing the error report. That is\nthe responsibility of the sending server. It determines the format and content\nof the non-delivery report it sends, and apart from one line that tends to\nappear around the middle of that report, that content is totally beyond our\ncontrol. Some particularly ill-behaved mail servers even throw away our one\nline and replace it with their own!\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, there is an additional limitation arising from the\nage of the SMTP standards that apply to email delivery. It was created at a\ntime when there was no spam, only universities were on the Internet, and email\nservers were run by experts who trusted each other implicitly. Email servers\nassumed that if there was a problem with the message, the sending server would\nhave refused to send it. Consequently, there's no error code for \"you have a\nproblem.\" This means that emails are refused using a numeric code that\nincorrectly indicates a problem with the recipient. Those ill-behaved servers\nmentioned above unfailingly identify this as \"recipient not found\" no matter\nwhat the text of the error actually says. This is most unfortunate, and the\nsource of a great deal of confusion.\n\nThe result of these factors is that although we cause error messages to be\ngenerated, and although we attempt to make the messages as informative as\npossible in the space allowed, the obscure mutterings of MAILER-DAEMON in\nresponse to a problem aren't going anywhere anytime soon. This is certainly\nthe single most significant drawback to our approach.\n\nAt such time as our options become more flexible in this area, we will\ncertainly take advantage of them, as we would very much like to send a simple,\nclear message to people with problems that makes it clear to them what the\nproblem is and who should be contacted to fix it.\n\n  7. What do the standards require for my server's HELO/EHLO information?\n\nFrom RFC 2821:\n\nA domain name that is not in FQDN form is no more than a local alias. Local\naliases MUST NOT appear in any SMTP transaction. [2.3.5][...]The domain name\ngiven in the EHLO command MUST BE either a primary host name (a domain name\nthat resolves to an A RR) or, if the host has no name, an address literal as\ndescribed in section 4.1.1.1. [3.6][...]The argument field contains the fully-\nqualified domain name of the SMTP client if one is available.\n[4.1.1.1][...]The SMTP client MUST, if possible, ensure that the domain\nparameter to the EHLO command is a valid principal host name (not a CNAME or\nMX name) for its host. [4.1.4]  \n---  \n  \nThe RFC also allows an alternate \"address literal\" form for machines with no\nhostname, but running a mail server with no hostname doesn't make sense.\nAddress literals are only used when email clients (like those using DHCP) send\nmail to their local servers. In practice, address literals from other mail\n\"servers\" indicate virus-infected clients trying to spread outside their local\nnetwork.\n\nWe will accept an EHLO/HELO if the FQDN provided is deliverable. That means,\nit must have either an A record, as the RFC requires, or an MX record. So we\nare actually less strict than the standard would allow us to be. This helps\nmany cases where the mail server's hostname is problematic, but it can be\nconfigured to EHLO with the domain it handles email for, and also some NAT-\nrelated cases where the apparent name isn't externally visible.\n\nWe do not verify the EHLO name against the reverse DNS for the server.\nRejecting email based on a mismatch there is specifically prohibited by RFC\n2821. This check, which some overzealous people do perform, causes bogus\nerrors in NAT environments and where more than one physical server may be\nassigned to handle mail for a single IP address (for example by using Layer 4\nswitching).\n\nWe do not accept address literals since all of our local mail clients are\nconfigured not to send them. If you have an email server using an address\nliteral, you should either fix it or configure it to forward all outbound mail\nto your ISP's mail server. It should be more inclined to regard your server as\na \"client\" and allow an address literal.\n\n  8. Why does my email server's DNS matter?\n\nDNS has two components, forward and reverse. The presence and validity of both\nof these components is the only way to be reasonably sure that a mail server\nbelongs to who it says it does. Either forward or reverse DNS on their own can\nbe easily subverted by spammers to forge email to appear as though it came\nfrom your domain, leading to large numbers of bounce messages and complaints\nabout email you never sent.\n\nIf we just check reverse DNS, spammers can (and do) buy service from\nunsuspecting ISPs and set up their reverse DNS to say things like\nmail.example.com. Next thing you know, they're spamming, and it looks like you\ndid it. But if we check mail.example.com, their plan is foiled because only\nyou control example.com and mail.example.com won't match what they claimed.\n\nIf we just check forward DNS, spammers can use any valid name from any IP\naddress they want, and all we've done is ensure that they're forging a\nlegitimate domain name (yours for instance). That makes the spam much harder\nto identify, and once again it looks like you are the culprit.\n\nWhile not perfect, matching up forward and reverse DNS is a powerful anti-\nforgery measure. It is easy for you to set up DNS properly and very hard for\nevildoers to fake. By having valid forward and reverse DNS for your mail\nserver, you're making it harder for spammers to pretend to be you, which saves\nyou time and frustration. By checking for it, we're also making it harder for\nspammers to pretend to be you.\n\n  9. What does NearlyFreeSpeech.NET do differently from other places that follow these rules?\n\nWe refuse messages much earlier in the delivery process. This not only keeps\nthe junk off of our servers entirely, but it causes the resulting error\nmessages to make it back to the sender much more often. Most places filter\nsuch messages later on, either tagging them as junk or silently discarding\nthem. That's easier and less confrontational, but not really helpful in the\nlong run.\n\nWe contact the people who run servers with problems like these and try to help\nthem fix things.\n\nWe try to make as much noise about this problem as possible, so people can see\nand understand how serious the issue is.\n\nAnother nice but minor benefit is that certain spam software that connects\ndirectly to target mail servers will remove an address from the list if it\ngets a permanent delivery error. This is a little rare, but every little bit\nhelps, and it does mean that our members are on a below-average number of spam\nlists.\n\n  10. How effective is your email policy?\n\nFor every 1,000,000 messages blocked, all but approximately 50-100 appear to\nbe either spam or viruses. That's more than 99.99% accurate. Also, the number\nof spam and viruses being blocked is constantly increasing, and the number of\nbroken email servers being blocked is trending downward, suggesting that this\nis the only email-handling policy that not only works, but actually gets\nbetter with the passage of time.\n\nThat makes perfect sense when you realize that this is the email policy that\nactively improves the email network, rather than trying to work around\nincreasing breakage.\n\nOn top of that, as a result of our policy, we've been able to help find and\nfix dozens of broken email servers. Every server that gets fixed makes spam\nharder to send and easier to identify, making the Internet a better place.\nThat's the kind of \"effective\" that really counts.\n\n  11. Wouldn't it be better just to run a spam content filter?\n\nA strong email policy and a good spam filter are orthogonal and mutually\nreinforcing.\n\nOverall, our email policy is tremendously effective at stopping the vast\nsupermajority of the virus propagation attempts that reach us, because viruses\ntend to have horrible SMTP implementations, and generally can't hide the fact\nthat they're on a machine that isn't supposed to be a mail server anyway.\n\nAlthough the vast bulk of the rest of the mail we block is spam, a fair amount\nof spam does get through. In that sense, our email policy is not very\neffective at blocking spam. But that is OK, because that is not its intent.\nIts intent is to provide a clear audit trail that assists subsequent\ndeterminations based on the content of a message.\n\nFor a spam filter to be good, it really needs to be specific to the recipient\n-- one person's spam is another person's ham. That means spam filtering is\nabout content, and it's really a form of censorship. Censoring content isn't\nreally what we do here; while we definitely believe people ought not to have\nto see spam, we think they ought to have the freedom to decide for themselves\nwhat is and isn't spam, rather than have a third party take the decision out\nof their hands. So we resisted spam filtering ourselves for a long time.\nHowever, what we found was that relatively few of the people who use our email\nforwarding service handle their own email; people who do that tend not to need\nour email forwarding. So, the bulk of our email forwarding domains get\nforwarded to other email providers (gmail, hotmail, ISPs, etc). All of those\nhave their own spam filters, and they don't share our views on third-party\ncensorship; they readily (and frequently automatically) block servers that\nsend too much spam, each using their own slightly different definition of\nspam. So we were getting blocked fairly often for forwarding messages that\nwere easily identifiable as spam. (Ironically because the only spam our email\npolicy lets through is easily identifiable as spam.)\n\nFor that reason, we've essentially been pushed into performing some\nrudimentary spam/virus checks designed to do the minimum necessary to keep us\noff blacklists and let spam filters closer to the end user do a better job.\nThus, our system will divert the most egregious spam into a special quarantine\n(checkable from our website). Everything else gets passed through. The goal is\nto block just enough of the worst spam to stay off of blacklists, and let\nanything even remotely questionable through so the recipient or a recipient-\nspecific spam filter can hopefully make the final decision.\n\n  12. How should I configure my mail server to avoid problems?\n\nHere are the surefire ways to be a good Netizen and stay out of trouble:\n\n     * The name you present in EHLO/HELO must be valid for mail delivery.\n\nThat means it must have either an A or an MX record in the DNS. It does not\nneed to match the apparent IP/hostname of your mail server, but it doesn't\nhurt anything if it does.\n\n     * Your IP address must have valid reverse DNS in the form of a valid PTR record and a matching A record.\n\nIf your reverse DNS exists, but it's 13.12.11.10.yourcompany.com (or worse,\n13.12.11.10.yourcompanysprovider.com) and a forward lookup for that name\nfails, that's not valid.\n\nIt is a very common spammer trick to set up reverse DNS to announce that their\nspam-sending server belongs to some respectable (but misconfigured) company;\nit's trivial for them to fake the PTR record. But it's nearly impossible for\nthem to fake the matching A record, so to distinguish yourself, you need both.\nSimilarly, it's also not valid to have only an MX record that matches the PTR\nbecause then spammers can use domains with wildcard MX's to forge spam.\n\n     * Use Sender Policy Framework (SPF) if the option is available to you.\n\nA lot of otherwise lethal misconfigurations can be overlooked if you have and\nuse SPF records for your domain. Matching SPF will override most of the other\nchecks (except the blackhole lists). However, SPF isn't suitable for every\nsituation; if email from your domain doesn't always come from the same\nserver(s) that you control, SPF is not for you. But it's quick, easy, and fun,\nso use it if you can. (Note: Because our members' email handling is\nasymmetric, they are generally in the category of people not well served by\nSPF.)\n\nThat's it; that's all it takes to avoid an entire class of delivery problems\nthat is only going to get worse with time. Note that each of the above can be\naccomplished by a proficient system administrator in a matter of minutes.\nThat's why we don't have much sympathy for people who can't get it done.\n\n  13. What mail server software is responsible for most problems of this nature?\n\nBy an incredibly wide margin, servers with standards-compliance problems are\nrunning Microsoft Exchange. We've even run into several Exchange servers that\nrefuse mail for \"postmaster\" at the domain they are handling, and it's hard to\nfind an easier rule to follow than that one.\n\nUnfortunately, these are the servers that tend not to get fixed when problems\nare reported. This is in part because Microsoft sold that company's IT\ndepartment a bill of goods about how great Exchange is and how easy it is to\nset up. Consequently, there appear to be a few people who stick in the CD,\nclick \"Install\" and hope for the best. Bad idea.\n\nFor our recommendation to people in this situation, please see the \"I can't\nfix my mail server,\" question below.\n\n  14. Who do you think you are, telling me how to run my own mail server?\n\nWe are not telling anyone how to run their email servers. We are merely\npublishing the details of our policy on accepting email. No one who does not\nwish to follow these simple, standards-based rules is under any obligation to\nsend email through our servers.\n\n  15. I can't fix my mail server because I don't know how. What should I do?\n\nTurn it off and send email through your ISP's mail server. They have a huge\nadvantage, because their business depends on investing the manpower and\nresources to do it right.\n\nIf you have had problems delivering email to our members, you may send us\nemail and ask nicely, and if we have the time available, we can try to point\nyou in the right direction as far as identifying the problem. Fixing it will\nbe your own journey of discovery, however.\n\n  16. I can't fix my mail server for political/bureaucratic reasons. Will you make an exception for me?\n\nThere are no exceptions to our email policy.*\n\n*Well, there's one. No matter how screwed up your server is, you can always send email to our issue tracking system (including support@NearlyFreeSpeech.NET, abuse@NearlyFreeSpeech.NET, and postmaster@NearlyFreeSpeech.NET) so we can give you feedback on your efforts to fix it.\n\n  17. I need to receive email from somebody who can't/won't fix their server. Will you make an exception for me?\n\nNo. See above.\n\n  18. Why make such a big deal about it?\n\nIn the beginning (once the Internet spread past ivy-wreathed walls into the\npublic eye), this was the attitude. The mad grab for cash was on, and ISPs had\nno incentive to force their mail-server-running customers to do things right,\neither because they didn't know enough to care, or because they were worried\nthose customers might get pissed off and quit. After all, who cares about\ndusty old standards as long as the money flows and the email gets delivered?\n\nThen the spam came. And came. And came. Now, the majority of all email is spam\nand CNN runs bits about people who are going back to writing letters because\nsorting the crap out of their inbox is too much work.\n\nTo handle it all, ISPs and other large companies pile on mail server after\nmail server, firewalls and filtering tools, to try to deal with all the crap.\nAnti-spam is a thriving cottage industry, and spam itself is big business.\n\nAt the same time, mail servers all over the place break (second law of\nthermodynamics) and don't get fixed because overworked sysadmins have more\nurgent problems; and as long as email isn't actually bouncing, who cares if\nthe Received: header has a typo in it?\n\nAll this to keep from risking that revenue from a few big corporate clients\nwho might threaten to quit if they were forced to do it right.\n\nBut at some point, someone at an ISP sat down and figured out that the\nconstantly escalating cost of dealing with all this junk is now more than the\nrevenue that would be lost if all the customers who threaten to quit if they\nhave to play by the rules actually quit because they had to play by the rules.\nA lot more.\n\nMeanwhile, accountants at Gmail and Hotmail and MSN and Yahoo! figured out\nthat they didn't have any corporate customers with misconfigured email servers\nwho would quit, but that they were spending tens of millions of dollars on\nspam and virus management anyway. There's no way to characterize that other\nthan paying to clean up someone else's mess. And, thanks to that second law,\nthe mess just gets bigger and bigger.\n\nAnd overnight, the worm turned.\n\nNow we have SPF, Domainkeys, Sender ID, and a host of other technologies\nadvanced by big email providers. We have solutions like \"Goodmail\" which\ndoesn't care how screwed up your email is as long as you're willing to pay\nextra to have it delivered. And they all, to varying degrees, have implemented\nsome or all of the same checks that we perform, and they've all made noise\nabout implementing the rest.\n\nIn other words, if the people affected by our policies don't like it, those\nare the very same people who may soon be paying a \"misconfigured server\" tax\nto the likes of America Online to get their email delivered.\n\nSo, to make a long story short, fixing your email to talk to us may keep you\nfrom having to pay to talk to them.\n\n  19. Do you lose business over this?\n\nYes.\n\nWe have no urge to be the biggest web hosting company on the Internet,\nparticularly if the only way to get there is pander to the lowest-common-\ndenominator mentality and make the Internet we love a haven for spammers and\ntheir ilk. We just want to be the best web hosting company on the Internet,\nand if you want to be the best, you start by doing good. Fixing this problem\nis good, and in the long run, it will hurt a lot less than the alternative.\n\nWe are aware that not everyone shares our philosophy, and that some choose\nother email services because of it. That is their prerogative.\n\n  20. What do you do to people who try to spam using your service?\n\nSorry, but our privacy policy prevents us from telling you where their remains\nare buried.\n\n\u00a9 2002-2024 NFSN, Inc.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
