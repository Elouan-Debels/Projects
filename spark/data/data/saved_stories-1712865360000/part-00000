It wasn't called\nWi-Fi stealing then, and I know many people who enjoyed the connectivity. But\nyou cannot do that anymore. Today, a scan of the Wi-Fi band reveals lots of\nprotected networks. The networks that are left open are either commercial or\nhackers. Commercial networks want to charge you $10 for an hour of connection.\nHackers want you to connect to their network so they can do something\nnefarious with your data or your computer. No wonder we end up paying through\nthe nose for a flimsy cellular Internet connection.\n\nI actually had a part in the closing of Wi-Fi networks. A few years ago, I was\nmanaging the development of the Wi-Fi stack in Windows, and it was pretty\nobvious that we needed to do something about Wi-Fi security. Many people may\nnot object to sharing their Internet bandwidth, especially when they do not\nuse it. But sharing your Wi-Fi connection does more. It provides direct access\nto all the computers in your home. Chances are that some of these computers or\nappliances are old, or unpatched, or poorly configured. So we made it really\neasy for Windows users to manage Wi-Fi passwords. Together with the networking\nindustry, we engaged in an education campaign to ask people to secure their\nnetwork. It seems that we were really successful.\n\nOf course, we will not come back to a time when all network were open. Besides\nthe security risks, there is also a potential liability. If someone connects\nto the Internet through your network and does something nefarious, the IP\ntraces will point to your router. You may well have to go to court and try to\nprove that no, it wasn't you. That defense may or may not work well. In fact,\nGermany just passed a law that requires that every Wi-Fi user secures their\naccess point, precisely so that people could not hide behind open Wi-Fi\nconnections. So, we have to accept that networks in the future will be\nprotected. If we want to enable sharing, we will have to work through that.\n\nAll that does not mean we cannot enable Wi-Fi sharing. We just need to\nengineer a solution that is secure for the Wi-Fi owner and also secure for the\nvisitors. The visitor's traffic shall be properly isolated from the home\nnetwork, in order to not expose the local computers and appliances. The\nvisitor shall be kept accountable, which probably requires signing with a\nverifiable network identity, and keeping logs of who visited what when. The\nvisitor shall be able to verify that the shared network has a good standing,\nif only to not waste time connecting to poorly connected services.\n\nNone of that seems overly hard to do. In fact, we have examples of such\ndeployment between universities worldwide, with EDUROAM. When a student or a\nprofessor from some EDUROAM member, say \"A.EDU\" visits another university, say\n\"B.EDU\", they can connect to the local network, say \"B-WIFI.\" They are\nrequested to sign-in, and they do that by providing their identity at their\nhome university, e.g. john.smith@A.EDU, and their own password. This is done\nusing professional grade equipment and protocols. Wi-Fi authentication uses\n802.1x, which is also used in most enterprise networks. The authentication\nrequests are routed using RADIUS, and they are typically encrypted so that\nman-in-the-middle cannot access the password. It appears to work very well.\n\nOf course, EDUROAM only services universities, and there are big differences\nbetween universities and homes. For example, EDUROAM does not make too many\nefforts to isolate visitors. Visiting scholars may well need to access local\ncomputers, so isolation would be counterproductive. Also, a university network\nis typically shared by thousands of students, and is thus not very isolated to\nstart with. The consumer grade Wi-Fi routers often do not support 802.1x, this\nis considered a \"professional\" feature. RADIUS is an \"infrastructure\" protocol\nwhich is well suited for linking universities, but would be hard to deploy\nbetween millions of homes. But EDUROAM outlines one of the key components of\nthe solution: network based authentication.\n\nNow, we just have to fill the gaps. Can we deploy solutions that are simple\nenough for home routers, yet have all the good properties of EDUROAM? I have\nseen many people and company try, but they have yet to succeed. Maybe it is\njust too hard, and we have to try something else, like the mobile connection\nsharing developed by Open Garden. But we can still dream of open Wi-Fi...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
