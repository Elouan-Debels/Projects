But I loved riding it. Its accessible size, smooth power,\nand surprising comfort won me over quickly. I\u2019m definitely sold on electric\nbikes now, even if they\u2019re still a spendy proposition.\n\nMotorcycles used to be a big part of my life. My father and I got our M\nlicenses together when I turned 18, and I spent much of my 20s on upright\nbikes, sport bikes, dirt bikes, and adventure bikes. I even got some\nexperience on Harleys to satisfy my curiosity about cruisers and had a job as\na motorcycle tour guide in Australia before any of my \u201creal\u201d media gigs.\n\nSadly, a wicked UTV crash in 2018 crippled my left hand and scared me off\npowersports. Selling my beloved Yamaha WR250R six months after that wipeout,\nfaced with the fact that I might never pull a lever clutch again, was\nmetaphorical salt in a very real wound.\n\nFour surgeries and endless hours of occupational therapy later, I ultimately\ndid get a decent amount of my hand\u2019s functionality back. But I\u2019m telling you\nall this because it wasn\u2019t until BMW offered to let me test ride the CE 02\nthat I got back in the saddle of a motorbike at all.\n\nElectric propulsion means no clutch, and a low seat means easy handling.\nCombine that with Euro refinement and interesting styling and suddenly the CE\n02 is among both the least-intimidating and coolest-looking motorcycles on the\nroad right now.\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nBMW\u2019s pitching this bike as an \u201ceParkourer,\u201d which is a term somebody made up\nto make \u201curban mobility\u201d sound slightly less lame. A lot of the marketing\nmaterials show pictures of the machine posted up at skate parks, with hip\nyoung people in streetwear draped over it.\n\nAs a fashion accessory, the CE 02 is indeed a spectacular statement piece. I\nfelt cool on it even while wearing BMW\u2019s loaner safety gear that made me look\nlike a fireman at an airport. But it is definitely not a high-powered BMX\nbicycle you can flick around alleys and throw off of jumps. It\u2019s also not a\ntoy you\u2019ll be buying on impulse\u2014it costs almost $8,000. For that coin, you\nhave your pick from plenty of nice and decently swift (and full-size) gasoline\nmotorcycles from less-luxe brands. If you\u2019re shopping used bikes, the world is\nyour oyster with eight bands in your pocket.\n\nThe \u201cSo who\u2019s this for?\u201d question is a lot easier to answer in Europe or Asia.\nIn a city where roads are tiny, parking is scarce, and the price of gas is\nstratospheric (if you can even find a station), a high-end, low-seat motorbike\nthat\u2019s impossible to stall is an awesome option for fun and getting around.\nIt\u2019s really as simple as that.\n\nAmerican use cases for the CE 02 are limited, but not zero. New York City?\nNah, unless you live in an elevator building where you can bring it into your\nbedroom, it\u2019d either get stolen or accidentally collected by the guys who\ncharge Uber scooters at night. Los Angeles? No thanks, I don\u2019t care if lane\nsplitting\u2019s legal, I\u2019d rather arrive two hours later than get pancaked by\nsomebody driving an Escalade with one knee on the wheel and two thumbs on\ntheir phone.\n\nBeach cities and bougie mountain towns, though, now we\u2019re talking. If you\u2019ve\ngot a little place somewhere like Park City, Santa Barbara, Provincetown,\nBreckenridge, et al. ... well for one thing, you probably do have $8,000 to\ntoast on a toy. And an eParkourer is a delightful option for getting around\nwhen the weather\u2019s nice.\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nAs for what it\u2019s actually like to ride, well, sorry it\u2019s taken 500 words to\nget here. But while the idea of the CE 02 is quite interesting, the riding\nexperience itself is unique and frankly somewhat difficult to describe without\nreferring to other vehicles.\n\nThe first aspect a rider encounters is a bike\u2019s size. The CE 02 looks and\nfeels larger in life than it does in photographs. It\u2019s chunky; substantial.\nThis comes through again as you sit down and manage the weight of it with your\nthighs. The official spec weight is 290 pounds, relatively light for a\nmotorcycle but enormous for a scooter. A Honda Ruckus, for example, is far\nless refined but a whole 100 pounds lighter.\n\nThe seat was probably the biggest surprise for me. That little strip of\npadding looks punishing, but it\u2019s actually quite comfortable even for a bony-\nbutted person like myself. The riding position is upright and natural, and the\nlevers are adjustable if reaching them is awkward.\n\nDaniel Kraus\n\nA clean and minimalist rectangular gauge pod sits on top of the handlebars,\nproviding essential info, and an integrated smartphone mount lets you\nsupplement the small screen with your phone for navigation and vehicle\ndisplays. Once your phone\u2019s plugged in and paired, you can actually control it\nwith thumb buttons on the handlebar\u2014you don\u2019t actually need to touch the phone\nscreen, which is nice.\n\nThe main gauge is easy enough to see, and I like that you can ride in minimal\nmode without the phone if you please ... though I\u2019d be slightly concerned\nabout my phone getting wet if I was riding and any kind of weather came up.\nAlthough if you\u2019re the sort of person who has $8K to splash on a recreational\nbike, your phone is probably new and high-end enough to be waterproof.\n\nIn terms of range, BMW says a CE 02 can go about 56 miles on a full charge\n(that\u2019d be a lot of riding on this thing) and that it zips from a stop to 30\nmph in three seconds. Top speed is posted at 59 mph.\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nEven with just 15 horsepower and 40.5 lb-ft of torque, it\u2019s definitely not\nslow. But you\u2019re in no danger of popping an accidental wheelie when you crack\nyour right wrist open. Riding modes include \u201cFlow,\u201d which has a slightly more\nmuted throttle response and moderate regenerative braking, and \u201cSurf,\u201d which\ngives you gutsier acceleration and allows for off-throttle coasting. \u201cFlash\u201d\nmode is an option, with even more intense acceleration response and\nregenerative braking.\n\nThis quickly became my favorite\u2014you can really start to feel \u201cone with the\nmotorcycle\u201d as you open and close the throttle. Well, there\u2019s no combustion so\n\u201copen and close\u201d isn\u2019t really accurate verbiage. But at spirited town speeds,\nFlash mode almost feels like you\u2019re linearly controlling the bike\u2019s speed as\nyou move your right wrist.\n\nThere are brakes, of course, both on levers like a bicycle (I pawed for a non-\nexistent foot brake more than once) but if you get into a groove and keep your\nhead on a swivel, zooming up to speed and decelerating with just the right\nwrist control is pretty thrilling and engaging.\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nWind becomes a factor above around 40 mph, and on my short test loop, I found\nabout 25 to 45 mph to be the most fun place to play.\n\nThe CE 02 doesn\u2019t feel powerful or light enough to do anything goofy like step\nits tail out or lift the front wheel, but little bursts of acceleration from\nstop lights and through traffic gaps put a huge smile on my face as I buzzed\naround the coastal Portuguese town of Cascais.\n\nThis oceanside enclave, like the towns I mentioned earlier, was the perfect\nplayground for the CE 02. It felt plenty fast on rare straightaways, weight\nwas totally manageable at near-stopped speed, and acceleration from a trot was\nactually pretty thrilling. Braking seemed fine, and I didn\u2019t have any\ncomplaints about steering response, either.\n\nAndrew P. Collins\n\nAll you really hear in the absence of an engine is wind noise and a little\ngear whine. It\u2019s inoffensive, albeit not particularly memorable.\n\nThe CE 02 itself hangs most of its personality on design\u2014it looks cool and\ndistinctive. It\u2019s not a deeply characterful machine, but it\u2019s still a ton of\nfun because of how friendly and accessible it is.\n\nBMW\u2019s new electric scooter/motorbike hybrid isn\u2019t really about \u201cbang for your\nbuck,\u201d becoming a collector\u2019s item, or elite performance. It\u2019s a neat piece of\nindustrial design that gives you access to one of the most fun experiences you\ncan have on wheels: Briskly scooting in near-silence without the cage of a car\naround you.\n\n2024 BMW CE 02 Specs  \n---  \nBase Price (Highline as tested)| $8,194 ($9,069)  \nPowertrain| air-cooled synchronous electric motor | two 1.96-kWh batteries  \nHorsepower| 15 @ 5,000 rpm  \nTorque| 40.5 lb-ft @ 0-1,000 rpm  \nCurb Weight| 291 pounds  \n0-30 mph| 3.0 seconds  \nTop Speed| 59 mph  \nWMTC Range| 56 miles  \nQuick Take| A high-end toy that doubles as a good getaround tool in a small\ncity with nice weather.  \nScore| 8/10  \n  \nBMW Reviews\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nThe chronicle of car culture, delivered to your inbox.\n\nSign Up\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
