As a result, every now and then, open projects need to work\naround governmental regulations. In today\u2019s news, KrakenRF team has stumbled\ninto an arms-trafficing legal roadblock for their KrakenSDR-based passive\nradar code, and is currently figuring it out. There\u2019s no indication that\nthere\u2019s been any legal action from the USA government \u2013 the team\u2019s being\nproactive, as fas as we\u2019re told.\n\nKrakenSDR hardware, to simplify it a lot, is five RTL-SDRs on one PCB \u2013 with\nplenty of work put in to do it the right way. It gets you much further than a\nfew dongles \u2013 there\u2019s shielded case, suitable connectors, reliable power\ndistribution, a proper USB hub, and importantly, receiver synchronization\nhardware. Naturally, there\u2019s nice things you can build with such a hefty\npackage \u2013 one of them is passive radar, which was a prominent selling point on\nboth KrakenSDR\u2019s pre-launch page back in 2021, and on their crowdfunding page\njust a week ago. How does that work?\n\nThere\u2019s RF emissions floating around you in the air, unless you\u2019re at sea or\nin the desert. Whether it\u2019s airplane transponders, cell towers, or a crappy\nswitch-mode PSU, the radiowaves emitted interact with objects all around you.\nIf you have multiple receivers with directional antennas, you can catch waves\nbeing reflected from some object, compare the wave reflected wave to the wave\nreceived from the initial source, and determine the object\u2019s properties like\nlocation and speed. If you\u2019d like to know more, IEEE Spectrum has covered this\ntopic just a week ago, and the previously-deleted KrakenSDR wiki page has more\ndetails for you to learn from.\n\nThrough exposure in IEEE Spectrum, the KrakenSDR work has received plenty of\nattention and comments. And this is where the International Traffic in Arms\nRegulations (ITAR) laws come in. We\u2019re not lawyers, but it does look like\npassive radar is on the list. Today, the code repository and the documentation\npages are scrubbed clean while the team is talking to legal experts.\n\nDealing with this is intimidating, and we wish them luck in clearing this with\nlegal. In the bad old days, certain encryption algorithms were famously in\nscope, which appeared absolutely ridiculous to us at the time. The laws did\neventually change to better reflect reality, but the wheels of justice turn\nslowly.\n\nPosted in Radio HacksTagged itar, KrakenRF, krakensdr, passive radar, RTL-SDR,\nRTLSDR\n\n## 92 thoughts on \u201cOpen-Source Passive Radar Taken Down For Regulatory\nReasons\u201d\n\n  1.

Especially if used to detect something some imbeciles want\nus to believe doesn\u2019t exist that\u2019s illegal (whether device(s) and/or act(s)\nusing device(s)) and/or not to be classified per Executive Orders covering\nnational classified information: Executive Order 10290 (September 24, 1951;\nHarry S.

I bet\nsome want people to believe passive radar doesn\u2019t exist so they can justify\nmore signals to traffic with.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. Col. Panek says:\n\nNovember 19, 2022 at 4:57 pm\n\nI\u2019m not sure that train of thought has a caboose but the idea of ITAR is not\nto give away capabilities we have, lest they be used against us. Usually\nthere\u2019s a specification so that companies can\u2019t sell things above a frequency,\nor power level, or accuracy, or something. Since everybody knows that\npassive/bistatic/multistatic radar is possible, there\u2019s probably a restriction\nagainst the particular algorithm that pulls targets out of that stream of\nbits.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      1.

Any detectors, any\ninstrumentation, any sensors including high-precision machining measurements,\nand even any and all kinds of machining itself.\n\nScience or application, only bureaucrats make these differences. After WW2, a\nlot of decommissioned radar sets were recruited for scientific research. SOSUS\narray data are handy for marine biologists. The devices do not care. They just\ndo their job.\n\nEverything is dual-use. Every weapon can be a tool and every tool can become a\nweapon. Doesn\u2019t matter if it is a radar or a hammer. Or a knife.\n\nMath is speech. Physics is speech. Code is speech. Math should be free for\nall, whether it is cryptography or signal processing. We can make it so. The\nbureaucrats have only their respective countries and geopolitical blocs. We\nkeep forgetting the West is less than a half of everything. Each treaty has a\nrange of countries that did not sign.

The government\nworks for us, they are not our parents, they are our employees. If Math posses\na threat then it does and strategies need to change. We\u2019re a nuclear power\nwith multiple dead man switch\u2019s what the hell threat could we possibly face\nthat would require the limitation of technology? The entire TS/SCI system is\ndumb. It just creates containers that adversaries can target and always fail.\nWe should have scrapped that archaic myopic strategy decades ago and moved to\ntrue information operations and flat communications within the dod. If China\ncould track EVERYTHING we were doing in real time but information and\nintelligence flowed in real time through Gmail do you know what would happen?\nNothing but us operations would be slightly faster, and china would be\noverwhelmed in processing and acting in the info. Add to that competent\ninformation ops that bled false info in with the real and we\u2019d be ten fold\nbetter then we are now banning math.

The reality is, it does not prevent the use of even\nselling of the technology to other US entities. In fact it doesn\u2019t really\nprevent anything.\n\nIt\u2019s more of a CYA list. You don\u2019t have to check ITAR, however if the\ngovernment finds out your exporting something covered, you better be prepared\nfor federal pound-me-in-ihe-ass-prison.\n\nSeriously though, they are smart to take this step, but I doubt the government\nwould care if they hadn\u2019t. There is nothing in their product that couldn\u2019t be\nrelatively easily replicated using public domain information. Of course\nproving that if/when the government comes after you wouldn\u2019t be fun, so CYA.\n\nReport comment\n\n          4.

To me there is a lack of continuity in the drawing of ITAR lines. When\nI worked at a major supplier of space-based imaging satellites back in the\nearly 2000\u2019s I was appalled that our government would permit Google to openly\npublish space imagery of nearly any place in the world; talk about access to\ntechnology that can be used against us. People will still figure out how to\naccess passive radar. Attacking KrakenSDR seems a little harsh. In my opinion,\nKrakenSDR\u2019s passive radar is a toy for exploring and energizing young people\nin the field of electronics and Ham Radio.

See the news about Russia buying washing\nmachines to scavenge chips for their tanks and missiles out of or how PS3s\nwere ITAR restricted because they were used as a cheap supercomputer to\nprocess data from US airforce drones for a while.\n\nNobody has mentioned it but passive radar is one of the technologies that is\ncapable of defeating the stealth capabilities of modern fighter jets. Stealth\noften works by simply reflecting the incoming radar signal away from the radar\nreceiver, so it can\u2019t \u201chear\u201d the echo.\n\nHowever, if you are using \u201cenvironmental\u201d signals *not* aligned with your\nreceiver direction, then some are likely to get reflected towards your\nantenna. That\u2019s how the Czech Vera system works.\n\nThis SDR dongle device certainly does not have the same capabilities as that\nmilitary radar system but it also doesn\u2019t costs many millions and is easily\ntransportable. Having free code that is working and capable of detecting\naircraft using low cost, off the shelf hardware without emitting any\ndetectable signal (unlike a conventional radar) could give someone a pretty\nsignificant R&D boost \u2013 or maybe even a military capability they don\u2019t have\nyet.\n\nThere are some rather good reasons why ITAR and Wassenaar agreements exist,\neven though they bring insane bureaucracy and trouble to \u201cmere mortals\u201d \u2013 e.g.\nI had Digikey refuse to sell me some PIC microcontrollers unless I filled\nseveral pages of ITAR-related forms (and Mouser having no issues selling me\nthat even without), former colleague who has acquired some surplus hardware\nand was looking for documentation got some rather scary interactions with the\nmilitary secret service because it turned out that this gadget was also used\nby the French Exocet anti-ship missile.\n\nTrust me, this isn\u2019t one you want to be pooh-poohing out of ignorance ...\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      1. beatjunkie says:\n\nNovember 20, 2022 at 4:39 am\n\nSeeing someone on a website dedicated to hardware hacking actually believing\nthe crap about scavanging chips from washing machines for military use makes\nme sad.

Fun fact, these SDR contraptions is not that by far.\n\nTamara and Vera has 2 main very important components these things don\u2019t have \u2013\nSoftware and very special type of receiving antenna. What is so special about\ntheir antenna (besides it is the most secretive part of both projects) \u2013 it is\nwide band, yet their LNAs on the input are VERY low noise.\n\nAnd the software? The positioning and tracking algorithms are not that specia.\nWhat is very special is signatures of targets. If you want to track something\nlike stealth fighter jet, you first need to know it\u2019s RF signature and getting\nthat is VERY HARD.\n\nAt least the USA is not claiming that Intel CPUs are military grade as they\ncan be used as such and therefore restricted \u2013 claiming that this thing is\nsome secret military whatever is BS.

This is passive: you map your local\nsignal. If, for example, you are using a noisy power supply as source, you\nmonitor that. Get a good sample, then crack open your DSP books at the section\non \u201ccorrelation\u201d to detect reflections (cat on roof, tree leaves in the wind,\njets). I suspect the limiting factor is range. Detecting weak signals is HARD\nand passive radars don\u2019t have a big source signal to help.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n          1.

Whether they implement passive radar in software, gateware, or\nhardware makes no difference from where I\u2019m sitting; the biggest limiting cost\nfor passive radar isn\u2019t the brains, it\u2019s the hardware.

With dense\nenough mesh of sensors we can hear disturbances flying through the air. With\nsubsonic disturbances we do not know about them much in advance, but we can\nhear when they passed, and triangulate, giving advanced warning. Then the\nadversary either flies high and gets exposed to radars, or flies low and is\nwell-heard.\n\nKind of like atmospheric variant of SOSUS.\n\nCan be also handy for civilian weather research/monitoring, maybe otherwise\nundetectable clear-air turbulences can be heard.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n          1.
