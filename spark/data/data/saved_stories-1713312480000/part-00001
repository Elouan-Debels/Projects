An\norganization dedicated to publicly rebuking critics of Israel had posted on X\na clip of Marzouca declaring that \u201cradical solidarity with Palestine means ...\nnot apologizing for Hamas.\u201d\n\nThe 20-second clip, from an Instagram live stream, rapidly garnered more than\n1 million views. Soon, the group, StopAntisemitism, was calling Marzouca a\n\u201cHamas terrorist supporter\u201d and tagging their employer, the branding firm\nTerakeet of Syracuse, N.Y. Hundreds of people commented on X, LinkedIn and\nemail, including one who asked: \u201cDo you really have antisemites like this\nworking for you, @Terakeet?\u201d\n\nWithin a day, Marzouca was fired \u2014 a development Terakeet announced as a reply\nto StopAntisemitism\u2019s Twitter thread, 15 hours after the original post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThank you for your swift action,\u201d StopAntisemitism wrote.\n\nTerakeet did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMarzouca, 32, is one of nearly three dozen people who have been fired or\nsuspended from their jobs after being featured by StopAntisemitism, according\nto the group\u2019s X feed, part of a wave of digital activism related to the\nIsrael-Gaza war. Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and Israel responded by\nattacking Gaza, groups have poured resources into identifying people with\nopposing political beliefs, sometimes deploying aggressive publicity campaigns\nthat have resulted in profound real-world consequences.\n\nWithin weeks of Oct. 7, \u201cdoxing trucks\u201d prowled the campuses of Harvard,\nColumbia and Princeton, displaying the names and photos of students and\nprofessors who had signed statements declaring solidarity with Palestinians.\nIn January, a Rutgers Law School student sued the university, alleging that he\nhad faced discriminatory disciplinary action after sharing what he deemed\n\u201cpro-Hamas\u201d messages from his classmates with school administrators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSix months into the war, the strategy has spread well beyond academia \u2014 and\nbecome especially potent among pro-Israel groups determined to call out any\nstatement they believe to be antisemitic.\n\nAmong a bevy of small social media accounts, StopAntisemitism has become one\nof the most prominent \u2014 and widely followed. Though some groups are dedicated\nto surfacing anti-Palestinian speech, none has StopAntisemitism\u2019s reach or\nimpact. Founded in 2018 as a \u201cresponse to increasing antisemitic violence,\u201d\nStopAntisemitism has dialed up its activity on X since the war, and often\nprovides its more than 300,000 followers with personal social media profiles\nand employer details for people it identifies as antisemitic.\n\n\u201cBy publicly exposing antisemites, StopAntisemitism has created an environment\nwhere those who propagate hatred against the Jewish people are met with real-\nworld consequences including but not limited to job loss and school\nexpulsions,\u201d StopAntisemitism\u2019s website reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cStopAntisemitism gets results,\u201d Liora Rez, the group\u2019s executive director,\nboasted in a LinkedIn post in November.\n\n\u201cThis is just a small sampling of the bigots StopAntisemitism has gotten fired\nor suspended in the past week,\u201d she wrote next to photos of people featured by\nthe account. \u201cSick of the legacy orgs doing nothing with your donations? DM\nme!\u201d\n\nRez did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nActivists have long used the internet to publicize comments they find\noffensive, and such pressure campaigns have been central to movements like\n#MeToo and Black Lives Matter. But the complex politics and brutal violence of\nthe Israel-Gaza war have created a particularly divisive moment. A slew of\nfigures have faced consequences for making statements about Israelis, the\nIsraeli state and the war, including a New York Times Magazine writer, law\nstudents entering the job market and Palestinian Israelis, who have been\njailed in Israel for being perceived as sympathetic to Hamas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMarzouca, who lives in Los Angeles and uses they/them pronouns, said\nStopAntisemitism\u2019s X post triggered a stream of threats. People emailed\nMarzouca saying they deserved to be sent to Gaza to die and criticizing their\nappearance, with one person calling them a \u201cdisgusting, manipulative rat.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions from The Washington Post about the group\u2019s online\nactivity, Marc Greendorfer, founder of the Zachor Legal Institute, a legal\nthink tank representing StopAntisemitism, described the group\u2019s activity as\n\u201creposting.\u201d It \u201c[repeats] verbatim, the public statements of people making\nantisemitic statements and provides opinion on those statements,\u201d he wrote in\na letter.\n\nSome prominent Jewish advocates argue that groups like StopAntisemitism play\nan important role in cracking down on religious discrimination. \u201cIf an\nindividual is going to publish or say hateful things \u2014 against any person or\ngroup \u2014 they should be held to account for them,\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, chief\nexecutive of the Anti-Defamation League, told The Post in a statement. He\nadded that the ADL directly confronts such individuals, \u201ccalling for\nconsequences if they do not apologize or attempt to change their ways.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOthers view this type of sleuthing as a damaging form of online vigilantism.\nJoan Donovan, an expert in digital activism and an assistant professor at\nBoston University, argued that the group\u2019s efforts are a form of doxing \u2014 the\npractice of posting personal information online to encourage harassment \u2014\nwhich in turn chills debate.\n\n\u201cWhen the mob is the judge, jury and executioner, we all end up suffering,\u201d\nDonovan added.\n\nThe high-stakes war has found especially fertile ground on social media, where\nsome Palestinian rights activists say they are disproportionately named,\nshamed and punished.\n\n\u201cThe intent here is not just to punish but also to have a chilling effect,\u201d\nsaid Lara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, a think\ntank. \u201cIt\u2019s to send a message to people that ... if you dare speak out of line\nwhen it comes to questions related to Israel, you can and may face dramatic\nconsequences \u2014 life-changing consequences.\u201d\n\n###\n\n\u2018StopAntisemitism gets results\u2019\n\nThe bloody Israel-Gaza war has intensified the long-standing debate over when\nand whether critiques of Israel are antisemitic. Since the Zionist movement\nbegan in the late 1800s, with European Jews seeking a nation-state, it has\ndrawn heavy criticism \u2014 and birthed common false conspiracy theories about\nJewish power. But as critics of Israel, including many Jewish people, have\ndenounced the state for its treatment of Palestinians, some supporters have\ncountered with a broad argument that any criticism of Israel or Zionism is\ninherently anti-Jewish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of reasonable differences,\u201d said Lila Corwin Berman, a\nprofessor of Jewish history at Temple University. \u201c[But] a lot of\norganizations [are] taking a pretty blunt-tool approach that any articulation\nof anti-Zionism is antisemitism.\u201d\n\nGreendorfer, of the Zachor Legal Institute, said StopAntisemitism uses the\nInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s definition of antisemitism,\nwhich includes denying Israel\u2019s right to exist.\n\nStopAntisemitism has flagged people for a variety of statements the\norganization considers antisemitic, including a college instructor who called\nIsraelis \u201cpigs\u201d and a high school basketball coach who wore a shirt with a\nwatermelon, a symbol of solidarity with the Palestinian cause, to a game.\n(Both apologized, and the college instructor is \u201cno longer with\u201d their\nworkplace, according to a StopAntisemitism post.)\n\nThe organization is ratcheting up its sleuthing abilities. As of early\nFebruary, StopAntisemitism has been seeking a senior open-source intelligence\nresearcher who has existing partnerships with law enforcement and is adept at\nmonitoring social media and the dark web for antisemitic posts, according to\nStopAntisemitism\u2019s website. (The role pays between $85,000 to $100,000, the\njob posting said.)\n\nThe Adam and Gila Milstein Family Foundation lists StopAntisemitism as a\n\u201csupported organization\u201d on its website. The philanthropy is tied to Adam\nMilstein, a wealthy real estate investor who is the co-founder of the Israeli\nAmerican Council, a prominent Jewish advocacy group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAccording to 2022 tax filings, the Merona Leadership Foundation, where\nMilstein\u2019s wife, Gila, serves as president, paid a $125,633 salary to Rez,\nStopAntisemitism\u2019s executive director, and provides the organization about\n$270,000 to cover its expenses.\n\nGreendorfer said The Post\u2019s characterization of StopAntisemitism\u2019s funding is\na \u201cmisinterpretation\u201d but declined to elaborate further. Nathan Miller, a\nrepresentative for the Adam and Gila Milstein Family Foundation, declined to\ncomment. The Merona Leadership Foundation declined to comment.\n\nDonovan, of Boston University, said online efforts to punish enemies originate\nwith activist accounts, such as those that identify unethical police officers.\nBut as a flurry of right- and left-wing accounts used the tactic to publicize\nand shame people without public power, the strategy became diffuse, wielded to\ndemonize everyone from supporters of transgender rights to Jan. 6\ninsurrectionists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThese accounts have become so widespread that it is difficult for social media\ncompanies to regulate them, Donovan said. When the billionaire Elon Musk took\nover Twitter, now named X, the platform\u2019s attempts to rein in posts triggering\nharassment dropped significantly, she added. Representatives from X did not\nrespond to a request for comment.\n\nGreendorfer says that because StopAntisemitism doesn\u2019t post \u201cprivate\ninformation,\u201d its methods don\u2019t amount to doxing.\n\nPosting identifying information about nonpublic figures can be harmful,\naccording to Nina Jankowicz, an expert on disinformation and online abuse.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re thinking about ... using social media to blow the whistle or to\nhold powerful people to account, that\u2019s very different than [doing it] because\nyou disagree with them or because they\u2019ve expressed an opinion that you find\nrepugnant,\u201d she said.\n\nCeline Khalife, a 25-year-old therapist, says StopAntisemitism shut down her\ncareer just as it was getting started. A video posted by StopAntisemitism\nshows the Palestinian American tearing down a poster of Israeli hostages. She\nsaid Israel kidnapped its own citizens, a false conspiracy theory.\n\nKhalife, who fled Lebanon after Israel bombed Beirut in 2006, told The Post\nthat she was flustered and misspoke in the video. She said she removed the\nposter because it contained the phrase \u201cHamas terrorists\u201d \u2014 propaganda, she\nargues, meant to minimize the Palestinian struggle.\n\nStopAntisemitism linked to Khalife\u2019s therapy clinic bio and posted her\nPsychology Today profile, warning that \u201cpatients must be made aware of her\nintrinsic bias and hateful act.\u201d\n\nDozens messaged her workplace insisting she be fired immediately; other notes\npoured into her cellphone and personal email. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with your\nnutjob therapist, Celine Khalife?\u201d one message viewed by The Post said.\n\nFour days after the video surfaced, the clinic fired Khalife, according to an\ninternal message viewed by The Post. On Facebook, the company announced it was\naware of the \u201cviral incident\u201d and said it does \u201cnot condone violence or\nintolerance in any form, nor do we condone misinformation.\u201d (Khalife\u2019s former\nemployer, the Grace Therapy and Wellness Center, did not respond to a request\nfor comment.)\n\nKhalife said it was \u201ccrippling\u201d to deal with the harassment, job loss and\ndamage to her professional reputation. She was not sure she could even pay her\nroommate $1,100 in rent.\n\n\u201cI felt like I couldn\u2019t go lower,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I did.\u201d\n\nRazzan Nakhlawi contributed to this report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTechnology\n\nBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devices\n\nSpaceX could finally face competition.
