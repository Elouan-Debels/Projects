The\nrevered director David Lynch \u2014 known for cult films like Mulholland Drive,\nInland Empire and Wild at Heart \u2014 has designed an exhibition entitled\n'Interiors by David Lynch. A Thinking Room' on the grounds of the Rho Fiera.\nThe exhibition marks a new kind of venture for the Oscar-winning auteur, but\naccording to it curator, Antonio Monda, the New York University film professor\nand former artistic director of the Rome Film Festival, it\u2019s not totally out\nof the blue.\n\n## 'Interiors by David Lynch.

I asked him, what are you doing? And he told me he designs\nfurniture now,' recounts Monda. 'So when the Salone del Mobile invited me to\ncommission a filmmaker for this special event, I knew he was the real deal.'\n\nInteriors by David Lynch A Thinking Room sketch\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of David Lynch)\n\nLynch\u2019s casual carpentry hobby led him to design a full-scale installation at\nthe fair. Inside each of the two 'Thinking Rooms,' a single armchair is\nsurrounded by thick curtains made of blue velvet \u2014 a nod to Lynch\u2019s 1986 film\nBlue Velvet. 'At the beginning, there was only one big armchair inside the\nroom. And I realised it was exactly like an image from one of his films,' says\nMonda of the scenography.\n\nAbove the chair, a series of brass tubes rise towards a curving gold ceiling.\nWhile around the perimeter, screens playing abstract videos act like portals\nto the outside world. According to Monda, Lynch posits the installation as a\nmoment of respite and reflection from the frenetic pace outside on the Fiera\nfloor. To construct the sets, Monda and Lynch worked with the set builders at\nMilan\u2019s Piccolo Teatro.\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of David Lynch and Salone del Mobile)\n\n'This the first time that I do these kinds of things and it was a lot of fun,'\nMonda reflects on the project. 'Because you see how the mind of an artist\nworks with a different form of expression. You\u2019re accustomed to seeing how\nLynch works when he does a film like Blue Velvet or a show like Twin Peaks,\nbut now his creativity, his talent and his vision are channelled into\nfurniture.' However, Lynch was adamant that his new foray into design exists\nseparately from his film career. 'He wants to keep it separated,' relays\nMonday. 'He has said that this has nothing to do with his films.'\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of David Lynch and Salone del Mobile)\n\n'Interiors by David Lynch.
