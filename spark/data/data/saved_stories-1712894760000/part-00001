Because the need to stay thin coincides\nwith conventional attractiveness, but doesn\u2019t coincide with being able to eat\nloads of junk food \u2014 the wing-munching thin person is a highly intriguing\ntrope.\n\nNo matter what supermodels and movies suggest, the person who eats what they\nwant and stays thin is a bit of an exaggeration. This is because neither films\nnor supermodels give us a proper estimate of the thin person\u2019s daily routine,\nlifestyle, exercise schedule and genetic make-up. Weight gain and loss is a\ncomplex process that involves both genetics and overall health, and lifestyle\n(diet, sleep, stress).\n\nAn individual\u2019s lifestyle, or their diet, sleep, stress, and physical\nactivity, significantly affects weight loss. Generally, we know that people\nwho work out and eat less junk food are less likely to be overweight. But, our\nengagement with another person\u2019s lifestyle is often fleeting, and doesn\u2019t give\nus a full picture of their routines. According to what Larry Cheskin, founder\nof the Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center, tells U.S. News, \u201cWhen you\nobserve somebody who doesn\u2019t seem to gain weight, they\u2019re not defying the laws\nof thermodynamics, the laws of physics...What they\u2019re doing, in some fashion,\nis balancing their intake and output.\u201d Essentially, there are certain\ninvisible aspects of a person\u2019s lifestyle that help burn the calories they\ntake in.\n\nFor example \u2014 you have a friend who meets you for weekend brunch and always\norders loads of chicken wings. You\u2019re surprised this person remains skinny\neven though they\u2019re not much of a fitness buff and demolish so many wings\nwhenever you see them. What you can\u2019t see is that this person has a grueling\ncommute that requires walking multiple kilometres daily, and that this person\nonly eats wings once a week \u2014 which isn\u2019t too often, and keeps a moderate diet\nfor the rest of the week.\n\nRelated on The Swaddle:\n\nUntrending: Does Intermittent Fasting Really Work?\n\nSome people are predisposed to gaining and carrying more weight, since\ngenetics heavily influences their lifestyle choices and the way their bodies\nprocess food. Obesity can be inherited, and those with obesity have a higher\ngenetic risk score \u2014 which, roughly, is a numerical value assigned to genetic\nvariations. Genes also contribute to weight gain/loss ability via affecting\nappetite, satiety, metabolism, food cravings, body-fat distribution, and\neating disorders according to Harvard Health.\n\nMetabolism, which affects how quickly someone\u2019s body burns calories, is\nbalanced according to a body\u2019s unique needs. Therefore, it can be different\naccording to one\u2019s age, gender, and natural muscle mass. Similarly, if a\nperson is more active, their body\u2019s metabolism rates go up, as they need to\nburn more calories. However, it is important to note that if an individual\neats beyond the calories their body needs and maintains a sedentary lifestyle,\na fast metabolism will eventually slow down and cannot prevent weight gain.\nPlus, medical conditions like Cushing\u2019s Syndrome, PCOS and hypothyroidism can\ncause slow metabolism rates, leading to more body weight.\n\nSo, the answer is: it is possible that a person can eat whatever they like and\nstay skinny. But this is only if their genetics and lifestyle lead to them\nburning the calories they consume.\n\nHowever, in subconsciously looking for ways to attain conventional beauty\nstandards and to have the freedom to eat what we like, we perpetuate ideas of\na) there being a miracle cure for weight gain and b) that weight gain is\ninherently awful. Both ideas are scientifically inaccurate \u2014 weight gain is a\ncomplex phenomenon and can be beneficial or healthy. In this case, a re-\nframing of the question might help. Instead of \u2018Can I eat whatever I want and\nstay skinny,\u2019 choose to ask, \u2018Can I eat whatever I like in balanced amounts to\nkeep myself healthy and nourished?\u2019\n\nShare\n\nWhatsappLinkedInX\n\nTags\n\nBodiesHealthdiet culture\n\nAuthorAditi Murti\n\nAditi Murti is a culture writer at The Swaddle.
