A lab analysis showed that the\ncounterfeit Ozempic drugs were actually relabeled insulin pens.\n\nThis disturbing incident underscores the critical need for consumers to\nacquire medicines only from authorized and licensed physical and online\npharmacies, as well as the importance of legal mandates like the European\nUnion Falsified Medicines Directive (EU FMD), which helps to prevent\ncounterfeit drugs from entering the legitimate supply chain and getting into\nthe hands of patients.\n\nThe victims of the counterfeit Ozempic pens suffered from severe hypoglycemia\nand seizures believed to have been caused by an insulin overdose. Earlier this\nyear, Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic, issued a warning about the growing\nnumber of illegitimate websites selling counterfeit versions of the popular\ndrug.\n\n\u201cNovo Nordisk is investigating and reporting every counterfeit case we are\nmade aware of to local authorities, in accordance with applicable\nregulations,\u201d Allison Schneider, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said in a\nstatement. \u201cPatients can help protect themselves by only buying medicines from\nlegitimate sources and with a prescription from a healthcare professional.\u201d\n\nNovo Nordisk has previously warned that \"medications purchased online or in-\nperson from foreign or unlicensed sources may be misbranded, adulterated,\ncounterfeit, contaminated, improperly stored and transported, ineffective,\nand/or unsafe.\u201d\n\n### How EU FMD protects consumers from counterfeit drugs\n\nThe incident in Austria and recent cases of counterfeit Ozempic drugs found at\nEuropean wholesale distributors proves that strict compliance with EU FMD is\nnecessary to reduce or avoid these incidents. EU FMD states that if a\nwholesale distributor does not receive goods directly from a manufacturer or\ndirectly from a designated wholesaler, they must perform risk-based\nverification. It appears that in this case, a verification was not performed,\nwhich led to the product being sold to another wholesaler in the United\nKingdom. The incident in Austria illustrates the critical importance of laws\nlike EU FMD for two key reasons:\n\n1\\. EU FMD mandates help to support counterfeit drug investigations. In the\ncase of the fake Ozempic found in Austria, the counterfeiters attempted to\nmask the adulterated product by putting 2D barcodes and serial numbers on the\npackaging. As part of the investigation, these barcodes were scanned and\nimmediately determined to be a set of serial numbers that were marked as\ndecommissioned. Additionally, if the falsified drugs somehow entered into the\nlegitimate supply chain, they would likely be detected upon point-of-dispense\nscanning, which is a requirement for retail pharmacies under EU FMD. Hospitals\nhave the option of scanning products when received as well as when they are\ndispensed.\n\n2\\. Laws like EU FMD discourage criminals from counterfeiting drugs. EU FMD\nand similar regulations around the world make it more challenging to\ndistribute counterfeit drugs in the legitimate supply chain through tools and\nrequirements such as serialization, reporting, barcodes, and verifications by\ndispensers, who are the last line of defense against counterfeiters. This\nlevel of difficulty serves as a deterrent to counterfeiting. While nothing can\npromise to stop counterfeiting completely, each layer of security helps the\npharmaceutical industry stay one step ahead of the criminals.\n\n### EU FMD investments make sense\n\nManufacturers bear the responsibility for funding the EMVS (European Medicines\nVerification System). While some in the pharmaceutical industry have argued\nthat EU FMD is an unnecessary financial burden, citing a \"minimal\" threat of\ncounterfeiting, the counterfeit Ozempic incident in Austria proves that the\ndanger is real and the investments are justified. The incident also shows that\nanti-counterfeiting systems only work when all supply chain entities use them\nas prescribed by law.\n\nIn a recent EU Commission meeting, representatives from DG SANTE, the group\nresponsible for carrying out the commission's policies on health and food\nsafety, stated that it is time for EU FMD stabilization periods to end and for\nauthorities to enforce full EU FMD compliance. The group also stressed that\nthe EU reporting system should be applicable in all EU member states by\nFebruary 2025, according to the meeting minutes.\n\nEU FMD is a necessity that will help to significantly reduce the incidences of\ncriminal enterprises distributing counterfeit drugs in the legitimate supply\nchain and putting lives in danger.
