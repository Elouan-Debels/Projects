(AP Photo/Eric Risberg)\n\nBy BROOKE SCHULTZ\n\nUpdated 10:00 AM UTC, April 9, 2024\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n\nLink copied\n\n  * Email\n\n  * Facebook\n\n  * X\n\n  * Reddit\n\n  * LinkedIn\n\n  * Pinterest\n\n  * Flipboard\n\n  * Print\n\nWith a compact mirror in one hand and an eyelash curler in the other, Grace Xu\ntold her roughly 300,000 TikTok followers she was likely about to be laid off.\n\nShe was right, she tells them in a subsequent clip. But she was planning to\npursue a different career anyway: as a content creator.\n\n\u201cI guess the decision has been made on my behalf,\u201d she tells viewers in the\nvideo posted earlier this year. \u201cThe universe has spoken.\u201d\n\nBy all accounts, the U.S. job market is holding strong, with employers adding\n303,000 workers to their payrolls in March. The jobless rate has now remained\nbelow 4% for 26 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s.\n\nBut that\u2019s of little comfort to the thousands of people who have nonetheless\nfound themselves out of work. Hiring has largely been concentrated to a few\nindustries, while tech and finance have only added a small number of jobs in\nthe last 12 months.\n\nRather than trying to return to traditional employment, however, people like\n26-year-old Xu are carving a new path for themselves through online content\ncreation, where they can make money from brand deals and advertising by\nproducing social media videos ranging from educational to entertaining.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nAnother month of robust US job growth points to continued economic strength\n\nUS job openings rise modestly to 8.8 million in February in strong labor\nmarket\n\nUnilever to cut 7,500 jobs and spin off its ice cream business, which includes\nBen & Jerry\u2019s\n\n\u201cI think most employees look at employers now and no longer think that they\nare going to find security \u2014 permanent security \u2014 in a job,\u201d said Sarah\nDamaske, who studies labor and employment relations, and sociology at Penn\nState. \u201cI think it makes it less risky to do something like go and be a\ncontent creator because employment with a traditional employer is so much\nriskier.\u201d\n\nIn an estimated $250 billion industry, 4% of global content creators pull in\nmore than $100,000 annually, according to Goldman Sachs Research. YouTube \u2014\nconsidered by creators to be one of the more lucrative platforms \u2014 has more\nthan 3 million channels in its YouTube Partner Program, which is how creators\nearn money. A spokesperson said the platform paid out more than $70 billion in\nthe last three years.\n\nMeanwhile, TikTok \u2014 which faces the threat of a national ban that could cost\nmany creators an income stream \u2014 has seen a 15% growth in user monetization,\naccording to a company spokesperson.\n\nMany people turn to full-time content creation only after they\u2019ve see a payoff\nfrom putting in the work, said Brooke Erin Duffy, a professor of communication\nat Cornell University. Or they are forced into it, as an avenue back to\nemployment.\n\nThe pandemic also reshaped how employees consider work, with many preferring\nto have more control over their schedules and the ability to do their jobs\nfrom home. In February, nearly 440,000 people applied to start their own\nbusinesses \u2014 up nearly 50% from a monthly pace of 300,000 just before the\npandemic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nAmong them are content creators, although they likely make up only a small\nportion.\n\nFor Xu, the pandemic allowed her to rediscover her hobbies. She started making\ncontent at that time as @amazingishgrace on TikTok. Her thrift flips \u2014 all\nsewn by hand \u2014 went viral and steadily built up a following. Even when she\nleft her banking job to move into the tech sector for a better work-life\nbalance, she kept on making content.\n\nWhen a round of layoffs happened last summer, Xu wondered if she should go to\ncontent creation full time, despite a deep fear of ruining things she loved by\nturning them into work. Her own layoff sped up her timeline.\n\n\u201cYou just have to have this belief that, like, once your life is wide open for\nsomething, it will come,\u201d she said, \u201cotherwise you\u2019ll drive yourself crazy\nthinking about it.\u201d\n\nAnother content creator, who goes by Pot Roast\u2019s Mom on TikTok, described\nstaying in her engineering job for so long because she was afraid of not\nhaving health insurance while also having to pay off her student loan. But\nwhen her eponymous cat, Pot Roast, died two years ago, she turned to content\ncreation full time.\n\n\u201cHer death just like revealed, or I guess opened my eyes, to that I liked\nnothing in my life besides her,\u201d said Pot Roast\u2019s Mom, who goes by her\nusername to protect her privacy. \u201cAnd when she died, I was like, OK, it\u2019s time\nto make some changes.\u201d\n\nA community of women in the industry helped her shift from traditional\nemployment to full-time content creation by demystifying brand deal pricing,\nand setting up payment tiers on platforms like Patreon, a subscriber service\nfor content creators.\n\nShe has accrued 1.2 million followers on TikTok and a majority of her income\ncame from Patreon last year \u2014 about $30,000 \u2014 with a small portion coming from\nbrand deals, around another $10,000.\n\nPot Roast\u2019s Mom saw a video recently where a woman said making cat content\nearned her $200,000 in a year. More than likely, she said, that was a one-off.\n\n\u201cI think if you do something like this, you have to be ready to fail, ready to\nnot make a lot of money,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be realistic.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it takes time, energy and resources to turn content creation into a\nsuccessful career, Duffy said. Creators have to negotiate multivideo brand\ndeals or sponsorships to have a semblance of steady income, but those can have\nmonthslong payout dates. Some rely on savings from their traditional careers\nto plug the gaps while they wait.\n\n\u201cThe level of unpredictability when you\u2019re dependent on a platform is quite\nprofound,\u201d she said. \u201cYour success is dependent upon an algorithm or updated\ncommunity guidelines or an audience that may or may not like you on any given\nday.\u201d\n\nCynthia Huang Wang tried her hand in full-time content creation after she was\nlaid off from her brand marketing job in February 2023. In January, she posted\na TikTok about returning to the workforce, taking her 164,000 TikTok followers\nalong as she updated her resume.\n\nWith the job market improving, Wang said she sees the appeal of returning to a\nstable income. Maternity leave at a corporate job also has pull as she and her\nhusband consider starting a family.\n\nThere are limitations, though, to what she\u2019s willing to return for, including\npay, title and work she\u2019s interested in doing.\n\n\u201cGoing back to the office every day would be a nonstarter for me,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think maybe like two, or max three, days because I still want to be able to\ncreate content. And I think going into the office every single day would\nreally impact that.\u201d\n\n## ___\n\nAssociated Press Staff Writer Chris Rugaber in Washington contributed to this\nreport.\n\nBROOKE SCHULTZ\n\nSchultz is a reporter for The Associated Press based in Pennsylvania.
