While Google perpetuates the\nperception that Google Chrome is a neutral platform built on open-source\ntechnologies, we argue that Chrome is instrumental in Google\u2019s strategy to\nreinforce its dominance in online advertising, publishing, and the browser\nmarket itself. Our examination of Google\u2019s strategic acquisitions, anti-\ncompetitive practices, and the implementation of so-called \u201cprivacy controls,\u201d\nshows that Chrome is far from a neutral gateway to the web. Rather, it serves\nas a key tool for Google to maintain and extend its market power, often to the\ndetriment of competition and innovation.\n\nWe examine how Chrome not only bolsters Google\u2019s position in advertising and\npublishing through practices such as coercion, self-preferencing, it also\nhelps leverage its advertising clout to engage in a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d paradigm,\nwhich serves as a cornerstone in Google\u2019s larger strategy of market control.\nWe also discuss potential regulatory interventions and remedies, drawing on\nhistorical antitrust precedents. We propose a triad of solutions motivated\nfrom our analysis of Google\u2019s abuse of Chrome: behavioral remedies targeting\nspecific anti-competitive practices, structural remedies involving an internal\nseparation of Google\u2019s divisions, and divestment of Chrome from Google.\n\nDespite Chrome\u2019s dominance and its critical role in Google\u2019s ecosystem, it has\nescaped antitrust scrutiny\u2014a gap our article aims to bridge. Addressing this\ngap is instrumental to solve current market imbalances and future challenges\nbrought on by increasingly hegemonizing technology firms, ensuring a\ncompetitive digital environment that nurtures innovation and safeguards\nconsumer interests.\n\nKeywords: Antitrust, Chrome, Google, Privacy\n\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation\n\nMunir, Shaoor and Kollnig, Konrad and Shuba, Anastasia and Shafiq, Zubair,\nGoogle's Chrome Antitrust Paradox (February 15, 2024).
