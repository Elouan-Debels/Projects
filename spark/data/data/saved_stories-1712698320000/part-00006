At the time, the\ntechnology was still nascent. Although there was a lot of enthusiasm, many\nefforts were academic, with little commercial deployment, and practitioners\nwere experimenting with a wide range of approaches.\n\nSince then, one company has emerged as the largest player in the 3D-printed\nbuilding market in the US: Icon. It\u2019s raised more than $400 million in venture\ncapital, built more than 100 homes with 3D-printed walls, and partnered with\nNASA and the military on various 3D-printed building projects.\n\nIcon recently presented at SXSW on the progress it\u2019s made, which provides a\ngood opportunity to take a closer look at the company and its technology. Icon\nhas made some genuinely impressive progress, and they\u2019re pushing the\ntechnology in the right direction. But, like any startup, it\u2019s also\nexaggerating its success. In particular, it\u2019s not as close to competitive with\n\u201cconventional\u201d construction as the team implies. Icon has made a lot of\nprogress, but it still has a long way to go.\n\n####\n\nIcon's Cost\n\nIcon has high hopes for its 3D printing technology, and while it stresses the\nmany advantages of 3D-printed walls \u2014 they\u2019re stronger, better insulated, and\neasier to make curved \u2014 the company clearly realizes that widespread adoption\nmeans bringing down the cost until it is competitive with or cheaper than\nconventional construction.\n\nHigh costs have previously made me skeptical of 3D printing as a building\ntechnology. Some back-of-the-envelope calculations for Icon\u2019s House Zero\nproject suggested that the walls cost on the order of several hundred dollars\nper square foot to build, vastly more than conventional construction (Icon\nsays its costs were $160 per square foot). However, on its project with Lennar\nin Texas, Icon claims it achieved a cost of $34 per square foot, a reduction\nof about 80% from House Zero.\n\nThis is an impressive reduction if we take that cost at face value (and I\u2019d be\nvery interested in learning more details). Icon appears to have come down the\nlearning curve by building a lot more houses, improving its process and\ntechnology along the way. Including the costs of its other housing projects\nyields a cost reduction of 27% with every cumulative doubling, greater than\nthe long-term rate of improvement in things like solar PV and wind turbines.\nAssuming its cost numbers are legitimate, and if it can maintain that rate (a\ngiant if), Icon will achieve a cost of under $2 per square foot of wall by the\n100,000th house.\n\nHowever, Icon is also exaggerating its achievement. It claims that $34 per\nsquare foot beats conventional construction on cost. But this is not the case.\n\nIcon\u2019s claim is based on cost data from the same NAHB construction cost survey\nwe looked at last week. By adding up the costs for the various systems that\nIcon\u2019s walls replace \u2014 the vertical framing, the drywall, the exterior finish,\nand so on \u2014 Icon estimates that the walls on a 2,500 square foot home cost\n$115,000 on average. By then estimating the number of linear feet of wall in a\nhome, they get an average cost of $35 per square foot of wall: higher than\nIcon\u2019s costs. (See footnote for my attempts to reconstruct this calculation.)1\nThus, per the NAHB numbers, Icon is now cheaper than conventional construction\nfor building walls.\n\nThere are a few things worth noting here. First, Icon\u2019s costs are predicated\non eliminating a lot of tasks that conventional construction requires:\ndrywall, exterior finish, applying waterproofing, and so on. This is\ncompletely reasonable, but it does require leaving the 3D-printed structure\nexposed (though painted) in the final condition both on the interior and\nexterior. If you want a different finish, that\u2019s doable, but it will add cost.\nIt will be interesting to see how willing people are to accept this: people\u2019s\nperceptions of exposed structure have historically been mixed. People like\nstructural wood beams so much they\u2019ll put in fake ones to achieve the look.\nConcrete blocks, on the other hand, look cheap and unfinished to most people.\n\nSecond, Icon is overestimating the cost of conventional construction. Icon\nimplies that the NAHB cost survey is what the \u201caverage\u201d home costs. But, as we\nnoted last week, the NAHB cost survey is not the cost of an average home: it's\nbased on a homebuilder survey that overweights boutique, luxury builders. The\ncosts of a home per the NAHB survey, not including the lot, are about $100,000\ngreater than the average cost in the Census. NAHB\u2019s costs of construction\n(including both hard costs and soft costs) work out to about $207 per square\nfoot in 2022; per the Census, the actual national average in 2022 was $168 per\nsquare foot, and the median was $158 per square foot.\n\nIcon is not comparing its costs to the average home, but to higher-end homes.\nThis was not necessarily deliberate: I\u2019ve also previously assumed that the\nNAHB survey data was a representative national average. But it means Icon is\nfurther from cost-competitiveness than an initial read of the numbers would\nsuggest.\n\nFurthermore, the NAHB cost categories that Icon uses include several things\nbeyond the basic vertical framing that Icon is replacing. The framing line\nitem, for instance, includes some costs for the roof as well. So even just\ngoing by the NAHB data, the costs per square foot of wall are lower than what\nIcon suggests.\n\nWe can get a better estimate of the costs to build a wall using conventional\nmethods by using a construction estimating guide like RSMeans. Per RSMeans,\nthe typical cost of a stucco exterior wall with 2x6s at 16\u201d OC and R30\ninsulation is about $16 per square foot. Drywall will be another $1.60 per\nsquare foot, which gets us about $17.50 per square foot, or around half of\nwhat Icon suggests the average wall costs.\n\nRSMeans costs for exterior stucco walls, national average.\n\nAnd this is for exterior walls. Construction of conventionally-framed interior\npartition walls will be even cheaper. RSMeans gives the cost of an interior\n2x4 wall with drywall on each side as under $6 per square foot.\n\nRSMeans costs for interior 2x4 partition wall, national average.\n\nEven if we make fairly generous allowances for things like trim and baseboards\n(which these costs don\u2019t include), we\u2019re still far below Icon\u2019s suggested\naverage costs.\n\nIcon doesn\u2019t, as far as I know, break down the costs of its interior and\nexterior walls separately. But per photos, an exterior wall has one more wythe\nthan interior walls, and will also require insulation and (possibly) more\nsteel reinforcing. An exterior Icon wall might be roughly twice as expensive\nas an interior wall, depending how you spread the costs of things like printer\nsetup and teardown time. It\u2019s not clear if Icon\u2019s $34 per square foot costs\nare for exterior walls (and interior walls are cheaper), or if that\u2019s an\naverage over all walls. If it's the latter, this suggests a cost of roughly\n$22 for an interior wall and $45 for an exterior wall.\n\nSo, while Icon has brought down the costs of its walls substantially, they're\nstill more expensive than typical construction. Rather than being cheaper than\naverage, based on Icon\u2019s stated cost numbers I estimate that Icon's walls are\nbetween 2 and 4 times as expensive as the average conventionally framed wall.\n\n####\n\nIcon\u2019s Technology Advances\n\nIn the same presentation, Icon introduces its next generation of 3D printers.\nUnlike its current 3D printer, which uses a gantry system, the next printer,\ndubbed \u201cPhoenix,\u201d uses a boom-mounted print-head. Not only does this give far\nmore flexibility in print-head movement, but it gives Icon the ability to\nprint second-story walls, which its current printer can\u2019t do. Phoenix also\nincludes some sort of steel wire extruder that can automatically place\nreinforcement, which was previously placed by hand.\n\nIcon\u2019s Phoenix printer, via Youtube.\n\nPhoenix seems like a major step in the right direction. A major drawback to a\ngantry printer is the setup and teardown costs. Based on images from Icon\u2019s\nproject with Lennar, setting up its current printers requires what looks like\nsetting a temporary printer foundation and building a rail system for them to\ntravel on, which is obviously expensive and time-consuming.\n\nIcon\u2019s gantry printers on its project with Lennar, via Smithsonian.\n\nA boom-mounted printer, by contrast, should have much less involved setup and\nteardown time (since the body itself doesn\u2019t move), and its greater reach\nshould enable it to do more printing without moving. Ideally, the printer can\nsimply be wheeled into place, start printing, and then wheeled out when it's\ndone.\n\nA challenge for this sort of printer configuration is keeping the print head,\nwhich is at the end of a long, cantilevering boom, accurately placed. Simply\nmaking the boom rigid enough that the print head doesn\u2019t move appreciably\nwould be incredibly expensive. To address this, Icon has mounted compensating\nactuators and computer vision systems to the print head, which automatically\ncorrect its position. This technology is similar to what makes the Shaper\nOrigin (a handheld CNC cutting tool that automatically compensates for arm\nmovements) work, and is something I suggested might be a good idea several\nyears ago, so I\u2019m pleased to see it here. With Phoenix, Icon claims they\u2019ll be\nable to achieve costs of $25 per square foot, another substantial reduction.\n\nMe in 2021, suggesting a print-head compensation mechanism akin to what\nPhoenix now appears to use.\n\nPhoenix\u2019s dynamically stabilized print head.\n\nBut once again, Icon is slightly exaggerating its achievements. Icon claims it\nwill be able to use this printer to build not only the walls of a house, but\nthe roof and foundations as well. These both seem technically possible, but I\nforesee limitations and challenges.\n\nIcon\u2019s plan for achieving 3D-printed roofs seems to require steeply sloping\nroofs. A 3D printer constructs things by placing a series of layers one on top\nof another, and there\u2019s only so far you can shift the placement of a layer off\nthe layer below while keeping the whole thing structurally stable. It\u2019s\npossible to 3D-print roofs, but that will constrain the home layouts and\nshapes that are possible (for instance, wide open spaces without interior\nsupports will likely require very tall roofs). Icon\u2019s own renderings of their\nfuture offerings show a mix of 3D-printed and conventionally built roofs.\n\nVia Icon\u2019s website.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how Icon plans to achieve 3D-printed foundations. One option\nwould be to print the foundations like any other structure, as a series of\nthin layers. Another option would be to use the printer like a conventional\nconcrete pump, and pour a more fluid, liquid mix in a fashion similar to\nconventional construction.\n\nThe second method seems more promising to me. Printing seems ill-suited for\nplacing the large concrete volumes that foundations require, and using\nprinting to create a slab-on-grade seems challenging. In either case, there\nwill still be substantial costs associated with foundation construction (such\nas excavation and ground compaction) that this system won\u2019t handle.\n\nMore generally, the fundamental question with 3D-printed buildings is how you\naddress all the parts of construction that can\u2019t be handled by on-site\nprinting: windows, doors, electrical wiring, HVAC, etc. A truly automated\nconstruction process must find a way to address these tasks as well.\n\nIcon clearly recognizes this: its SXSW presentation calls 3D printing merely\nthe first step in Icon\u2019s larger push towards complete construction automation.\nIt\u2019s not clear to me if this was always their plan or if it\u2019s revisionist\nhistory, but we have seen this approach elsewhere. Diamond Age, for instance,\nuses a gantry-mounted 3D printer which gets switched out for different robotic\ntools to handle other portions of the construction process. Icon is clearly\ntrying to push automation farther into more tasks, but its trajectory is\nunclear. Ultimately, installing doors, windows, and wiring will require\nsubstantial advances in robotics, and while it\u2019s possible Icon is working on\nthese sorts of capabilities (I can imagine Phoenix forming a motion-stabilized\nplatform that can then mount different robotic tools to it), we\u2019ve seen little\nfrom Icon so far along these lines.\n\nOne other thing I\u2019m curious about is what Icon\u2019s project backlog looks like.\nSince its project with Lennar (first announced in November of 2022), the only\nproject it\u2019s announced is a planned development at a \u201cBohemian Campground\nHotel\u201d near Marfa, Texas, called El Cosmico. The El Cosmico homes, which range\nfrom 1,500 to 2,400 square feet, start at $900,000, not exactly homes for the\nmasses. Even this project was announced more than a year ago: Icon\u2019s website\nonly says that \"new projects will be revealed soon.\"\n\n####\n\nConclusion\n\nIcon has made impressive progress with its 3D-printed homes. Its costs appear\nto be falling substantially, its learning rate appears high, and its\ntechnology continues to improve. Though Icon exaggerates how competitive with\nconventional construction it is, it\u2019s still shifted my opinion, and I'm less\nskeptical of 3D printing as a construction technology than before.\n\nBut the company still has a lot of challenges in front of it. Contra Icon, the\ncompany\u2019s 3D-printed walls are still more expensive than conventional\nconstruction, and I have yet to see an obvious path or initiative that will\npush its technology to handle the rest of the construction process (which Icon\nitself agrees is the ultimate goal). It's also a little eyebrow-raising that\nIcon hasn\u2019t announced anything resembling a \u201cmarket rate\u201d project in almost 18\nmonths, or any new residential projects in a year. But Icon has raised a lot\nof money and doesn\u2019t seem to be spending it frivolously, so hopefully it\u2019ll be\nable to push forward.\n\n1\n\nNAHB cost data is below, with the items Icon\u2019s system replaces highlighted.\n\nThis comes to $118,401 for a 2,561 square foot home. If we scale this down to\na 2,500 square foot home, we get $115,580, approximately the number Icon uses.\n\nFor the wall length, 2,500 square feet on a one story home is equivalent to a\nsquare 50 feet by 50 feet. If we simplify and assume the interior is\nequivalent to four full-length interior walls, we get 400 linear feet of wall.\nAssuming an 8-foot high wall gets us 3,200 square feet of wall, which yields\njust under $36 per square foot. This is slightly different from Icon\u2019s number,\nbut it's close, so I assume their calculation looked something like this.\n\n### Subscribe to Construction Physics\n\nBy Brian Potter \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nEssays about buildings, infrastructure, and industrial technology.\n\n11 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 Restack\n\n11\n\nShare this post\n\n#### What Progress Has Icon Made on 3D-Printed Homes?\n\nwww.construction-physics.com\n\n10\n\nShare\n\n10 Comments\n\nPatrick D. Caton2 hrs agoGood analysisThere is definitely a place for printed\nhomes, just like other prefabricated solutions. The hype, however, is\nunjustified.I have similar concerns that apply to both prefabricated and\nprinted structures. Because of the large amount of resources required,\nbuildings of all types should be as long-lasting as possible. What is often\nforgotten in this space is that in order to achieve longevity, buildings must\nbe adaptable to changing usage patterns. The greatest advantage that\ntraditional construction has is that you can cost-effectively add to or update\ntraditional structures several times over their useful lifespan without\ncompromising structural integrity. But when it comes to prefabricated\nstructures or printed ones, the design criteria are exceedingly rigid for that\ninitial use case. And if one goes in to make changes, that will require a\npretty in-depth engineering analysis of what is feasible, much more involved\nthan a traditional model. And likely to be completely impractical at the end\nof the day.Expand full commentLike (5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n1 reply\n\nNiclasThe Paradox Ravens2 hrs agoThe problem, at least in many rich countries,\nis not the price of building housing, but restrictive zoning and expensive\nland.
