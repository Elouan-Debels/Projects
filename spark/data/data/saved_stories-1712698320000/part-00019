This\nacquisition marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter as we continue our\nmission to create the best chat app on earth.\n\n> If you haven\u2019t heard of Beeper before, welcome! We make a universal chat app\n> \u2013 one app to send and receive messages on 14 different chat networks. You\n> might have also heard about Beeper Mini, our briefly available iMessage-on-\n> Android app.\n\nIn many ways, our journey has only just begun. Beeper has just over 115,000\nusers and was, until today, in beta. Given the state of the messaging\nlandscape today, we believe there is a huge opportunity for us to push\nboundaries and create new experiences in chat. The majority of other chat apps\nhave stagnated, entrenched in their positions, with no significant new players\nemerging since Discord\u2019s launch in 2015. Given the state of the messaging\nworld, we\u2019ve long felt the need for a strong ally with the resources to\nsupport us on our quest. Automattic has a long history of putting user control\nand privacy first with open source, and great bilateral relationships with\nMeta, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Matrix and others that we hope can usher in a\nnew era of collaboration.\n\nIt\u2019s a fantastic match. Automattic is best known for supporting WordPress and\nWooCommerce \u2013 two open source software projects that underpin huge portions of\nthe internet\u2019s publishing and ecommerce infrastructure. Together, we\u2019ll\ndevelop software for a third fundamental pillar of the internet: chat.\n\nMatt, Automattic\u2019s CEO, and I have known each other for years. He was an early\nuser, supporter and investor in Beeper. We\u2019re very well aligned on our goal\n(build the best chat app on earth), approach (open source where possible), and\nindependence (Beeper will operate independently as part of Automattic\u2019s Other\nBets division).\n\nThis is a big bet. Automattic is doubling down on chat after their acquisition\nlast year of Texts.com, a messaging app with a similar mission. Our teams and\nproducts will merge, and I will take on the role leading the team as Head of\nMessaging. It will take a bit of time for us to integrate and combine forces\nunder the Beeper brand. We\u2019ve got big plans! I\u2019m really excited about the\nfuture of chat\n\nEric Migicovsky\n\nBeeper CEO \u2192 Automattic Head of Messaging\n\n### For Beeper users...\n\n  * The Beeper app you know and love is only going to get better with the support of Automattic!
