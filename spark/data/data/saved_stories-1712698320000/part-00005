Today,\nat Google Cloud Next, we\u2019re introducing exciting model updates and platform\ncapabilities that continue to enhance Vertex AI:\n\n  * Gemini 1.5 Pro is now available in public preview in Vertex AI, bringing the world\u2019s largest context window to developers everywhere. Imagen 2.0, our family of image generation models, can now be used to create short, 4-second live images from text prompts. We\u2019re also making image editing generally available in Imagen 2.0, including inpainting/outpainting and digital watermarking. Additionally, we\u2019re adding CodeGemma to Vertex AI, a new model from our Gemma family of lightweight models.\n\n  * Because response accuracy is critical for gen AI services, we are expanding our grounding capabilities in Vertex AI, including the ability to directly ground responses with Google Search, now in public preview. Vertex AI users now have access to fresh, high-quality information that significantly improves accuracy of model responses.\n\n  * To help our customers manage and deploy models in production, we\u2019re expanding our MLOps capabilities for gen AI, including new prompt management and evaluation services for large models. These features make it easier for organizations to get the best performance from gen AI models at scale, and to iterate more quickly from experimentation to production.\n\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into these announcements.\n\n### Giving customers the best selection of enterprise-ready models\n\nWe\u2019re doubling down on our mission to give customers the best selection of\nenterprise-ready models. In just the last two months, we've added access in\nVertex AI to a variety of cutting-edge first-party, third-party, and open\nmodels, from Google\u2019s Gemini 1.0 Pro to Gemma, the lightweight family of open\nmodels based on the research and technology we used to create Gemini, and\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude 3 family of models.\n\nAnnounced in February, Gemini 1.5 Pro is now in public preview, bringing the\npower of the world\u2019s first 1 million-token context window to customers. This\nbreakthrough allows natively multimodal reasoning over enormous amounts of\ndata specific to a request.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing customers create entirely new use cases, including building AI-\npowered customer service agents and academic tutors, analyzing large\ncollections of complex financial documents, detecting gaps in documentation,\nand exploring entire codebases or data collections via natural language.\n\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage is using Gemini 1.5 Pro to enrich the underwriting\nprocess and to automate the mortgage application process, for example.\n\nSAP is exploring opportunities to include the model in the SAP generative AI\nhub, which facilitates relevant, reliable, and responsible business AI and\nprovides instant access to a broad range of large language models.\n\nTBS, one of the main commercial broadcasters in Japan, is using Gemini 1.5 Pro\nto automate metadata tagging on their large media archives, improving\nefficiency and creating space for more creative work.\n\nAnd Replit is testing Gemini 1.5 Pro to generate, explain, and transform code\nwith higher speed, accuracy, and performance.\n\nIn addition, we are announcing that Gemini 1.5 Pro on Vertex AI now supports\nthe ability to process audio streams including speech, and even the audio\nportion of videos. This enables seamless cross-modal analysis that provides\ninsights across text, images, videos, and audio \u2014 such as using the model to\ntranscribe, search, analyze, and answer questions across earnings calls or\ninvestor meetings.\n\n### Imagen delivers advanced generative media capabilities\n\nWhile the Gemini models are great for advanced reasoning and general-purpose\nuse cases, task-specific gen AI models can help enterprises deliver\nspecialized capabilities. We\u2019re seeing organizations like Shutterstock and\nRakuten leverage Imagen 2.0 to generate high-quality, highly accurate images\nat enterprise scale.\n\nToday\u2019s preview of text-to-live image capabilities makes Imagen even more\npowerful for enterprise workloads. This allows marketing and creative teams to\ngenerate animated images such as GIFs, and more, from a text prompt.\nInitially, live images will be delivered at 24 frames per second (fps) with a\nresolution of 360x640 pixels and a duration of 4 seconds, with plans for\ncontinuous enhancements.\n\nGiven the focused design of this model for enterprise applications, it\u2019s adept\nat themes such as nature, food imagery, and animals. It can generate a range\nof camera angles and motions while supporting consistency over the entire\nsequence. Upholding our commitment to trust between creators and users, Imagen\nfor live image generation is equipped with safety filters and digital\nwatermarks.\n\nWe\u2019re also updating Imagen 2.0\u2019s image generation capability with advanced\nphoto editing features, including inpainting and outpainting. Now generally\navailable for Imagen 2.0 on Vertex AI, these features make it easy to remove\nunwanted elements in an image, add new elements, and expand the borders of the\nimage to create a wider field of view. Additionally, our digital watermarking\nfeature, powered by Google DeepMind\u2019s SynthID, is now generally available,\nenabling customers to generate invisible watermarks and verify images and live\nimages generated by the Imagen family of models.\n\n### Connect foundation models to sources of enterprise truth\n\nFoundation models are limited by their training data, which can quickly become\noutdated and may not include information that the models need for enterprise\nuse cases. Today, we are announcing that organizations can ground models in\nGoogle Search, giving customers access to the combined power of Google\u2019s\nlatest foundation models and access to fresh, high-quality information. This\nmeans users get results that are rooted in one of the most trusted sources of\ninformation, built on decades of experience ranking and understanding\ninformation quality.\n\nWe also offer multiple ways for enterprises to leverage retrieval augmented\ngeneration, or RAG, which lets organizations ground model responses in\nenterprise data sources, using methods like semantic similarity to search\ndocuments and data stores.\n\nAt Google Cloud, we call this concept of grounding on search and enterprise\ndata \u201cEnterprise Truth,\u201d and we see it as a foundation for building the next\ngeneration of AI agents \u2014 agents that go beyond chat to proactively search for\ninformation and accomplish tasks on behalf of the user.\n\n### Get the best performance from gen AI models at scale\n\nWe\u2019ve expanded Vertex AI\u2019s MLOps capabilities to meet the needs of building\nwith large models, letting customers work on all AI projects with a common set\nof features, including model registry, feature store, pipelines to manage\nmodel iteration and deployment, and more. With this common set, customers can\ncontinue to benefit from their existing MLOps investments while meeting the\nneeds of their gen AI workloads.\n\nToday\u2019s announcements make it easier for organizations to get the best\nperformance from gen AI models at scale, and to iterate more quickly from\nexperimentation to production:\n\n  * Vertex AI Prompt Management targets some of the biggest gen AI pain points we hear from customers: experimenting with prompts, migrating prompts, and tracking prompts and parameters. Vertex AI Prompt Management, now in preview, provides a library of prompts for use among teams, including versioning, the option to restore old prompts, and AI-generated suggestions to improve prompt performance. Customers can compare prompt iterations side by side to assess how small changes impact outputs, and the service offers features like notes and tagging to boost collaboration.\n\n  * Evaluation tools in Vertex AI help customers compare models for a specific set of tasks. We now support Rapid Evaluation in preview to help users evaluate model performance when iterating on the best prompt design. Users can access metrics for various dimensions (e.g., similarity, instruction following, fluency) and bundles for specific tasks (e.g., text generation quality). For a more robust evaluation, AutoSxS is now generally available, and helps teams compare the performance of two models, including explanations for why one model outperforms another and certainty scores that help users understand the accuracy of an evaluation.\n\n\u201cAutoSxS represents a huge leap forward in our generative AI model evaluation\ncapabilities. Automating evaluation was a key success factor for getting LLMs\nin production,\u201d said Stefano Frigerio, Head of Technical Leads, Generali\nItalia.\n\nLast but not least, today we\u2019re also expanding data residency guarantees \u2014\nwhich cover data stored at-rest for Gemini, Imagen, and Embeddings APIs on\nVertex AI \u2014 to 11 new countries: Australia, Brazil, Finland, Hong Kong, India,\nIsrael, Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and Taiwan. Customers can now also\nlimit machine learning processing to the United States or European Union when\nusing Gemini 1.0 Pro and Imagen. Joining 10 other countries we announced last\nyear, these new regions give customers more control over where their data is\nstored and how it is accessed, making it easier for customers to satisfy\nregulatory and security requirements around the world.\n\n### Take the next step in the gen AI journey\n\nTo deliver on the promise of gen AI, organizations need to balance model and\ninfrastructure capabilities against cost, ensure models anchor their reasoning\nin the appropriate data, and adapt MLOps for deploying, managing, and\nmaintaining models at scale. With today\u2019s announcements, Vertex AI customers\ncan satisfy these requirements faster and more easily than ever, letting them\nfocus on AI-powered innovation instead of maneuvering adoption complexity.
