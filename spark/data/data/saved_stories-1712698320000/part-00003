Top authors including\nJodi Picoult and media companies including the New York Times have also\nalleged that the company violates copyright law by training the algorithms\nthat power popular services like ChatGPT on their work. Billionaire Elon Musk\nsued OpenAI for diverging from its original nonprofit mission. And government\nagencies in the United States and Europe are investigating whether the company\nran afoul of competition, securities and consumer protection laws in multiple\nregulatory probes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cIt might be a good thing that ChatGPT could be a lawyer because a lot of\npeople are taking its a** to court,\u201d Silverman said during a November segment\non Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d\n\nUnder siege, OpenAI is turning to some of the world\u2019s top legal and political\nhuman minds. It has hired about two dozen in-house lawyers since March 2023 to\nwork on issues including copyright, according to a Washington Post analysis of\nLinkedIn. The company has posted a job for an antitrust lawyer \u2014 with a salary\nof up to $300,000 \u2014 to handle the increasing scrutiny in the United States and\nEurope of its partnership with Microsoft. It has also retained some of the top\nU.S. law firms, including Cooley and Morrison Foerster, to represent it in key\ncases.\n\nOpenAI is in advanced talks to hire Chris Lehane, a former press secretary for\nAl Gore\u2019s presidential campaign and the architect of Airbnb\u2019s public policy\nefforts, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the\ncondition of anonymity to describe sensitive talks. OpenAI plans in the coming\nmonths to lean heavily into the idea that U.S. AI companies are a bulwark\nagainst China, supporting American economic and national security interests\nagainst an increasingly aggressive foreign power \u2014 a strategy once deployed by\nFacebook parent Meta in an effort to align more closely with the Trump White\nHouse.\n\nLehane positioned Airbnb as supporting the aspirations of everyday\nentrepreneurs, amid heated regulatory disputes with cities across the country.\nIn another sign of OpenAI\u2019s maturing political strategy, the company joined\nthe industry trade group TechNet this year.\n\nThe rapid expansion underscores a new reality: OpenAI is at war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe company is playing defense amid a rush of lawsuits, investigations and\npotential legislation that threaten its goal of building the world\u2019s most\npowerful AI. The posture is a dramatic shift from just a year ago, when\nWashington lawmakers were enamored with the potential of ChatGPT and the\npolitical acumen of the company\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman.\n\n\u201cEveryone thinks of us as Big Tech,\u201d said Che Chang, OpenAI\u2019s general counsel.\nBut Chang argues the company isn\u2019t far from start-up mode, adding that in\n2022, it had just 200 employees.\n\nNow OpenAI has about 1,000 employees total, he said, and the legal team has\nbeen part of that rapid growth. He jokes that he\u2019s aged a few years in the\nmonths since ChatGPT was released but calls the increased legal challenges\n\u201crelatively commensurate to the impact we have had on the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cI am empathetic to the point that a lot of people say, \u2018Look, I was just\nminding my own business and this AI revolution happened,\u2019\u201d Chang said.\n\u201cNaturally, there\u2019s going to be some negativity coming out of that.\u201d\n\nSuch an evolution is part of a pattern in Silicon Valley, where companies\ninitially celebrated for their technological achievements ultimately face\nlegal and political backlash for the perilous downsides of their products.\n\n\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re in the big leagues,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, Uber\u2019s first\npolitical adviser and a fixer for start-ups in heavily regulated industries.\n\u201cThey are the market leaders in this completely revolutionary thing, which is\nvery exciting but also means it\u2019s going to be controversial for a really long\ntime\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut even for the fast-moving tech world, OpenAI\u2019s evolution happened quickly.\nOther companies\u2019 products were available for many years or even decades before\nthey attracted the eye of Washington regulators or legal challenges from\ncelebrities and legacy companies. It has been less than 18 months since the\nrelease of ChatGPT.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone empire expanded with little intervention for almost 17 years\nuntil last month, when the Justice Department brought a lawsuit alleging it\nwielded an illegal monopoly over phones. Google was 22 years old when the\nagency hit the company with its first landmark antitrust case in 2020. Even\nFacebook \u2014 with a notoriously fraught relationship with Washington lawmakers \u2014\nlaunched on college campuses 13 years before its Cambridge Analytica scandal\nand fallout from the 2016 election sullied its reputation.\n\nOpenAI has had mixed success so far in the copyright suits. A judge dismissed\nmany of the claims in Silverman\u2019s lawsuit, but she allowed some key\nallegations over whether OpenAI copied the comedian\u2019s and other authors\u2019 work\nto stand. Silverman and the authors refiled their complaint last month.\n\nAs the copyright cases proceed, OpenAI is also embroiled in litigation with\nits co-founder and now competitor, Musk. He sued the company this year,\nalleging it has diverged from its nonprofit mission. He sought a court order\nrequiring OpenAI to follow its \u201clong-standing practice of making AI research\nand technology developed at OpenAI available to the public\u201d rather than\nkeeping it proprietary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe company\u2019s gloves are off. OpenAI responded by publishing old emails it\nsaid show that Musk sought control over the start-up and attempted to merge it\nwith his car company, Tesla. In a court filing last week, OpenAI asked a judge\nto dismiss the billionaire\u2019s claims, calling his lawsuit \u201c150 paragraphs of\nself-congratulation and revisionist history.\u201d\n\nOpenAI is also at the center of several regulatory investigations, which have\nforced the company to spend even more on legal support. The Securities and\nExchange Commission is looking into whether investors were misled during the\nchaotic period when Altman briefly left the company. The Federal Trade\nCommission is probing whether it ran afoul of consumer protection laws in a\nnumber of areas, including a data leak and ChatGPT\u2019s inaccurate claims. And\nthe commission has had talks with the Justice Department about which agency\nshould probe its multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft, amid concerns\nthat such deals are dampening competition in the quickly evolving AI market.\n\nAnna Makanju, the company\u2019s global affairs chief, said in a Washington Post\nLive interview that the growing regulatory scrutiny of the company should be\nin some ways \u201creassuring\u201d because it shows governments already have a number\nof mechanisms to address the challenges presented by artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThere is sometimes a sentiment that because this technology is new, we\u2019re\ntotally unprepared and there are no ways to really keep it under control,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cThere are quite a few regulators that already do have the authority to\ntake action against AI-generated harms.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, governments around the world are increasingly crafting laws to\nrespond to AI. Last month, the European Union passed its AI Act, which will\nput new guardrails on the technology in the coming years. Similar efforts lag\nin the United States, but a bipartisan group of senators is expected to\nrelease a plan to create AI legislation in the near future. Chang says he\u2019s\noptimistic that more guidance from policymakers could help answer some of the\nlegal questions confronting the industry now.\n\n\u201cThis is the initial crescendo of loud response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will never go\naway, but I think the initial shock and awe will calm down a little bit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nTechnology\n\nBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devices\n\nBiden administration announces major expansion for Ariz. chip facility\n\nMeet the 25-year-old who TikToked his way onto RFK\u2019s campaign team\n\nIn 2018 crash, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot just followed the lane lines\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n", "frontpage": false}
