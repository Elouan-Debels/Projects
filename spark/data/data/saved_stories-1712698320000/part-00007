But wild\nexpenses, shady deals, and greed turned it into \u2018a fucking clown show.\u2019\n\nBy Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human\nbehavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was\na reporter at Bloomberg.\n\nApr 1, 2024, 5:00 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nIllustration by Hunter French\n\nShane Smith built Vice into a cultural behemoth by bluffing his way into round\nafter round of funding \u2014 until he reached a dizzying $5.7 billion valuation\nfrom which only a precipitous fall was possible.\n\nThat fall has been happening in slow motion for years, but things finally\ncrashed to the ground in February of this year, when Vice announced it would\nshutter its award-winning news division, lay off hundreds, and stop publishing\nto its website entirely. For some insiders at the company, this outcome felt\ninevitable. The only question was how long Smith could keep making deals to\nkeep disaster at bay.\n\nVice employed a lot of talented people at its lower levels. But any attempt to\nlook at the company\u2019s finances suggests a long history of issues at the very\ntop. Vice Media\u2019s overall business had been rickety for years before it filed\nfor bankruptcy in May 2023 and sold itself to Fortress, an investment\nmanagement firm.\n\nAccording to sources, while Vice execs were spending opulently in some areas,\nthe newsroom struggled to pay its bills. A person familiar with the company\u2019s\nfinances claimed that Vice delayed paying vendors until services would be shut\noff, at which point the company would realize they were necessary and try to\nfigure out how to pay the bills. Among the services shut off on multiple\noccasions in the run-up to the bankruptcy were Getty and Pacer, two accounts\ncrucial to any newsroom. It was particularly difficult for freelancers to get\npaid \u2014 a process that reportedly sometimes took months of hounding. A vendor\ncalled Wipro won a $9.9 million judgment in arbitration for unpaid bills \u2014 one\nof two factors that led to Vice\u2019s eventual bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cSince at least 2021, Vice has not had a NetJets account.\u201d\n\nThree people alleged that it was not unusual for corporate credit cards to be\nabruptly cut off, including one person whose card was cut off. One newsroom\nleader reportedly paid $5,000 out of their own pocket to freelancers Vice\nowed. A division head allegedly created a shadow accounting system because the\nactual accounting department was so overwhelmed, it was impossible to know how\nmuch budget was left.\n\nSometimes certain lines of business weren\u2019t told about the revenue goals they\nwere expected to fulfill. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s actual accounting and\nexpense controls were messy. For instance, Vice\u2019s digital division had\nexpenses from NetJets \u2014 a private jet service \u2014 on its profit and loss\nstatement, two sources told me. (A third confirmed the NetJets account existed\nwithout saying which balance sheet it was on. Two sources took credit for\neventually canceling the NetJets account. \u201cSince at least 2021, Vice has not\nhad a NetJets account,\u201d according to Vice spokesperson Samira Sorzano.) One\nexecutive source alleged that the digital division was funding a production\nexecutive\u2019s $350,000 salary \u2014 an executive who the source claims did virtually\nnothing. Another exec heard, to their shock, that someone had reportedly spent\n$24,000 on a one-way ticket from New York to London.\n\nWorse, after the May bankruptcy, almost $20 million in executive headcount was\nleft on the budget, one source told me. (\u201cFalse. This grossly exaggerated\nfigure is off by several million dollars,\u201d said Sorzano.)\n\nAn executive told me that Vice\u2019s accounting was \u201cfanfiction finance.\u201d \u201cIs this\nwhat working at WeWork felt like?\u201d they wondered.\n\n\u201cIs this what working at WeWork felt like?\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t have to go like this. At a lecture in Scotland in 2016, Smith\nbragged that Time Warner tried to buy Vice, and so did Fox and Viacom. (He\ncomplained that these companies tried to give Vice haircuts in valuation and\n\u201ctried to censor us, naughty.\u201d) Disney entered discussions with Vice about\nacquiring the company for $3.4 billion, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\nUltimately, Vice remained independent.\n\nFor this story, I talked to more than 20 people, including investors,\ncreditors, and former Vice executives and employees at all levels of the\ncompany \u2014 and their only real point of disagreement was whether Smith or his\nsuccessor, Nancy Dubuc, deserved more of the blame for the company\u2019s collapse.\nThese sources described a corporate culture with no discernible strategy and\nlittle of the necessary financial infrastructure or discipline needed to run a\ncompany of its scale.\n\nAt times, I heard what sounded like conspiracy theories in attempts to explain\nthe vacuum of competent leadership. I heard, variously, that news was propping\nup everything else, and that the digital division was taking on expenses to\nmake the TV division look good. I was also repeatedly told to look into Vice\u2019s\nrelationship with Saudi money. Among executives, there was little agreement\nand, instead, a lot of blaming each other for bad decisions.\n\nVice\u2019s lack of understanding of how newsrooms work even extended to this\nstory. In response to an email to current Vice CEO Bruce Dixon for comment on\nthis piece, I received correspondence from David Shane at Resolution\nCommunications, a crisis PR firm, who told me he was working with Fortress and\nVice. When I sent him a request for comment on this story, he replied with a\nlist of his own questions, most of which felt like an attempt to identify my\nsources.\n\nBergeson LLP\u2019s emails were headlined \u201cNot for publication,\u201d even though I had\nnot consented to any communication being off the record\n\nI then received emailed responses to my inquiries from Bergeson LLP, a law\nfirm that has represented the Church of Scientology and which describes its\nmedia practice as influencing \u201cpotentially damaging media reports\u201d and\n\u201cdealing with what is now known as \u2018fake news.\u2019\u201d Throughout the reporting\nprocess, I would email questions to Shane and receive responses from Bergeson\nLLP \u2014 but the firm asked that Vice\u2019s responses be attributed to Sorzano,\nVice\u2019s director of global communications, a person with whom I never spoke\ndirectly.\n\nBergeson LLP\u2019s emails were headlined \u201cNot for publication,\u201d even though I had\nnot consented to any communication being off the record, per The Verge\u2019s very\npublic background policy. The firm also questioned the use of anonymous\nsources, saying, \u201cIt is troubling that the false attribution [sic] \u2014 indeed\nevery allegation put to Vice by The Verge \u2014 comes from anonymous sources, whom\nThe Verges\u2019s [sic] refuses to name despite Vice\u2019s requests.\u201d\n\nAnonymous sourcing is a standard practice at any journalistic outlet engaged\nin investigative work, and there is no requirement to name sources at a\nsubject\u2019s request, particularly when they have otherwise been presented with\nsufficiently detailed information to comment on allegations. Identities are\nroutinely protected to prevent companies from retaliating against employees or\nanyone else for speaking out. It is astonishing that Vice \u2014 whose once-storied\nnewsroom won Emmys and Peabodys and a Pulitzer \u2014 no longer understands this.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to explain how and why Vice Media fell this far, but\nmaybe the simplest is just this: Shane Smith fucked over a lot of people.\n\nThings looked rosy in 2014. Smith, speaking at an event at the Paley Media\nCouncil, bragged that Vice was ahead of its digital media competitors in terms\nof being a real business. \u201cWe had to make money,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always\nhad to make money on every single thing we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve never had debt\nfinancing, any of that stuff. We always made cash.\u201d\n\nHe went on, answering a question about why Vice\u2019s valuation \u2014 at the time,\n$2.5 billion \u2014 was bigger than that of other digital media companies. Smith\nsaid that competitors Vox Media (the owner of this website) and BuzzFeed\nweren\u2019t as far along as Vice was. \u201cWe\u2019re budgeted for next year to do a\nbillion dollars\u201d in revenue, Smith said.\n\nVice didn\u2019t do a billion dollars in revenue that year. By 2019, Vice\u2019s revenue\nwould be \u201cbarely north of half a billion,\u201d according to a person familiar with\nthe company\u2019s finances, who added that \u201cthere was never a line of sight to a\nbillion.\u201d In 2022, Vice was set to miss its more modest revenue target of $700\nmillion by \u201cover $100 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a modern day Bonnie and Clyde and we are going to take all your\nmoney.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Nancy Dubuc was brought in to replace Smith after The New York Times\npublished an article detailing allegations of sexual harassment at Vice Media.\nIt detailed a boys\u2019 club culture under Smith and included details on a \u201cnon-\ntraditional workplace agreement\u201d that many employees felt meant they could not\ncomplain about harassment. Dubuc arrived as CEO, ostensibly to clean up Vice\u2019s\nact after Smith stepped away from the daily business to focus on content and\ndeals \u2014 \u201cthe only things that I am good at,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIn a statement about the changeover, Smith wrote, \u201cWe are a modern day Bonnie\nand Clyde and we are going to take all your money.\u201d It was not clear whose\nmoney, specifically, he meant.\n\nDubuc came from A+E Networks and had been a board member of Vice for years.\nBut two people who worked closely with her worried about whether she\nunderstood Vice\u2019s business. At A+E, Dubuc had taken the history out of the\nHistory Channel, championing reality shows such as Ice Road Truckers. A+E also\nhad a smash hit in Duck Dynasty, and Dubuc kept the channel\u2019s costs low by\nrerunning the program as a marathon.\n\nThat was not exactly Vice\u2019s sensibility, even on its cable channel, Viceland.\nInstead, under creative director Spike Jonze, it produced programming such as\nweed cooking show Bong App\u00e9tit and documentary series Balls Deep as well as\nthe late-night talk show Desus & Mero, which featured two comedians who\u2019d\npreviously podcasted together. Besides Viceland, Vice also had an HBO deal for\nthe award-winning program Vice News Tonight.\n\nA \u201cscrewball cast of suits\u201d\n\nIn the first year of Dubuc\u2019s tenure, the company laid off 10 percent of its\nworkforce, launched a news show called Vice Live \u2014 which one source called\n\u201cthe biggest piece of shit I\u2019ve seen in my life\u201d \u2014 and canceled it in less\nthan two months. Dubuc did raise $250 million in debt financing, but Disney,\none of Vice\u2019s key investors, wrote down its $400 million investment, saying it\ndid not expect a return. Then Vice News Tonight was canceled by HBO \u2014 one of\nthe few profitable deals at the company, according to two sources.\n\nSources repeatedly described Dubuc\u2019s executive team in unflattering terms. One\nexecutive described Dubuc\u2019s hires as \u201ca fucking clown show\u201d; another called\nthem \u201ccomical\u201d; a third called them \u201ccartoonish\u201d; a fourth called them a\n\u201cscrewball cast of suits\u201d; a fifth told me he\u2019d learned valuable lessons from\nthem about what never to do with a company.\n\n\u201cVICE has a well-defined mission and produces globally recognized, award-\nwinning content,\u201d said Vice spokesperson Sorzano. \u201cWe will not speculate on\nunnamed executives who may or may not have worked directly for the company\u2019s\nformer CEO.\u201d\n\nDubuc brought in Jesse Angelo, a childhood friend of James Murdoch\u2019s who had\nspent his career up until that point working exclusively for News Corp. She\nalso hired Cory Haik, the former publisher of a digital startup called Mic,\nafter that company collapsed and laid off nearly its entire staff. Both Angelo\nand Haik were reportedly told that they were in line to follow Dubuc as CEO,\naccording to five people familiar with the company\u2019s succession talks.\n\n\u201cCory was the executioner at her bosses\u2019 behest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was never told I would be CEO, I never asked to be CEO, and I did not want\nthe job. Anyone telling you otherwise is misinformed or lying,\u201d Angelo told me\nin an email.\n\nMost of the people I spoke to didn\u2019t have kind words for Angelo. One source\nsaid they weren\u2019t clear on what he did all day. Another felt he only liked the\n\u201cfun\u201d parts of the job. \u201cJesse Angelo had no interest in how any of it was\nmade or how to make it better,\u201d said Dave Mayers, a former producer and\ncinematographer at Vice.\n\nFour sources told me that Haik frequently took the blame for decisions\nactually made by Angelo or Dubuc. \u201cCory was the executioner at her bosses\u2019\nbehest,\u201d one person said.\n\nThe people I spoke to were split about whether Vice was salvageable when Dubuc\ncame in. Some thought that a more appropriate executive might have been able\nto right the ship; others said Smith\u2019s excesses essentially doomed the\ncompany. There was widespread agreement that Dubuc did not understand news.\n\u201cShe had no idea what she was doing when it came to journalism or content,\u201d\none person told me. \u201cIt was pretty clear the company was screwed once we got\ninto her tenure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not going to comment,\u201d Dubuc wrote me in an email. \u201cThis reads as\ngossip, disgruntled sources and an intentional smear, which is not\njournalism.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the other executives who came in with Dubuc were described as\nbusiness types who were dressed up in \u201cVice costumes\u201d but didn\u2019t actually\nunderstand the company. According to five people close to the situation, the\nmain skill set displayed by Dubuc\u2019s team was managing up; she\u2019d surrounded\nherself with yes-men. (When I asked Dubuc about this characterization in an\nemail, she denied it. \u201cAs anyone in those rooms would tell you, Jesse and Cory\ncertainly didn\u2019t say yes to me, which was welcomed.\u201d)\n\nRevenue in 2020 was $580 million. After a deal to go public by merging with a\nblank-check company failed in 2021, Smith was forced to give up voting control\nof the company. But he was still the company\u2019s hype man. In an interview with\nBusiness Insider, Smith insisted Vice\u2019s future was bright. \u201cIf the timing\ncomes along and we\u2019re planning blistering 2022 and traffic and events do what\nwe think they\u2019re going to do, then the sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can\nforecast out that same growth in 2023, then we are one of the hottest media\ncompanies to invest in.\u201d\n\nSeven people I spoke to talked about \u201cShane deals.\u201d One former executive told\nme that when someone said, \u201cThis is Shane\u2019s thing,\u201d it meant that something\nwas a little sketchy and shouldn\u2019t be broadcast to the company. Among the\n\u201cShane deals\u201d the executive mentioned was \u201cChange Incorporated,\u201d a sponsored\ncontent deal paid for by Philip Morris to encourage people to quit smoking.\n(This was part of a broader attempt by Philip Morris to change its image.)\nAnother was the relationship with Greek broadcaster Antenna Group \u2014 a\nrelationship that, when it fell apart, broke Vice.\n\nTo Vice\u2019s credit, it still continued to produce award-winning television. In\n2022, when the company was doing Emmy seating, Smith\u2019s assistant allegedly\nasked where Smith\u2019s statues from 2021 were. Apparently, Smith expected to have\nbeen credited as an executive producer, despite having no involvement on the\nshows that had won awards. The company had to ask the academy for a second set\nof every award the company won in 2021 and redo its 2022 submissions to\ninclude Smith. And in 2023, Smith and Suroosh Alvi, another co-founder,\nallegedly personally bought many of the tickets for Vice Media to attend the\nEmmys since the bankrupt company had no budget. Some managers and recently\nfired Vice News Tonight people bought their own.\n\nVice\u2019s problem had little to do with what it made; it was an issue of\nleadership\n\n\u201cShane Smith was an Executive Producer of several highly successful Vice\nTelevision shows and as such, received Emmy Awards for the shows on which he\nwas credited,\u201d said Sorzano, the Vice spokesperson. \u201cIt is commonly accepted,\nstandard industry practice for Executive Producers of any award-winning show\nto receive an award for their involvement. It is not the company\u2019s practice to\npurchase award show tickets for employees who the company no longer employs.\u201d\n\nFor television journalism, the Emmys are among the highest honors. The\nnominations proved Vice\u2019s problem had little to do with what it made; it was\nan issue of leadership. When Vice was finally serious about selling itself,\nthe ad market had significantly changed from the days when Disney had valued\nthe company in the billions.\n\nAt one point, Antenna Group was a likely buyer. It already had an extensive\njoint venture with Vice Media in Vice World News \u2014 a \u201cShane deal,\u201d according\nto three people. Smith was incentivized to make deals because his contract had\n\u201cno ceiling on how much he could be paid and multiple sources of payment that\nfunneled him millions of dollars in compensation.\u201d He got a $1.6 million\nannual salary on top of the 5 percent cut of his deals. To earn that\ncommission, a quarter of the revenue for the deal had to be profit.\n\n(Vice declined to comment on Smith\u2019s salary or commissions. \u201cAs its founder,\nShane Smith is and has been an integral part of Vice,\u201d according to Sorzano.\n\u201cHe has always been tasked with securing strategic partnerships and\nopportunities around the world for the company irrespective of the former\nCEO\u2019s role.\u201d)\n\nSeveral people told me that these \u201cShane deals\u201d probably extended the lifetime\nof the company\n\nSmith was making millions during a period when Vice was having trouble paying\nits bills and freelancers, during which time the company underwent at least\nfour rounds of layoffs. He outearned everyone actually running the business,\naccording to a report in New York.\n\nThe Vice World News venture meant that Antenna broadcast 250 hours of Vice\ncontent annually across its channels in a number of countries, mostly in\nEurope. The deal \u201cprovided Vice with a steady stream of stable and profitable\nrevenue,\u201d according to the bankruptcy filing. Vice was paid $134 million under\nthe deal in 2022, according to the bankruptcy filing \u2014 even though Antenna\u2019s\nwebsite claims it only built an eight-figure business with Vice. Paying nine\nfigures for an eight-figure business doesn\u2019t seem sustainable.\n\n(Sorzano declined to comment on whether Vice World News was a profitable\nbusiness for Vice.)\n\nAntenna could have walked away from a deal to fully buy Vice for a number of\nreasons. But the one that seemed most plausible to the people I spoke to was\nthat when Antenna was doing due diligence, it got a look at Vice\u2019s books and\nmay not have liked what it saw. In any event, Antenna severed the Vice World\nNews contract, in addition to walking away from the acquisition. Antenna\nrepresentatives did not return repeated requests for comment. Vice\u2019s Sorzano\ndeclined to comment on this speculation.\n\nSeveral people told me that these \u201cShane deals\u201d probably extended the lifetime\nof the company. Without them, Vice would have been over much sooner. But they\ncame with huge fixed costs \u2014 and other kinds of costs, too.\n\nVice \u201crepeatedly blocked news stories that could offend the Saudi government\u201d\n\nBefore the bankruptcy, Vice began to court Saudi money. This is anathema to\njournalists, since Saudi agents killed and dismembered Washington Post\njournalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 inside a Saudi consulate in Turkey.\n(Khashoggi was there to get marriage documents.)\n\nVice had a relationship with the Saudis before Khashoggi was killed; in August\n2018, Shane Smith was on a yacht with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\nto discuss a business partnership. After Khashoggi\u2019s murder, Vice began\nreviewing its contact with the Saudi publishing group SRMG.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Vice from secretly organizing a music festival in the middle\nof the Saudi desert in 2020. A year later, Vice\u2019s ad agency was pitching\nmarketing campaigns to promote Riyadh. In 2022, Vice began deal talks with the\nSaudi media conglomerate MBC Group. (MBC had also taken a 30 percent stake in\nAntenna earlier that year.) Vice eventually did go through with the direct\npartnership with MBC, which was announced in January 2023.\n\nWorse still, The Guardian reported that Vice \u201crepeatedly blocked news stories\nthat could offend the Saudi government.\u201d In the London office, employees\nworking on Vice\u2019s Saudi joint venture replaced a photograph of a protest in\nmemory of Sarah Everard, a UK woman kidnapped and murdered by a police\nofficer, with \u201ca giant map of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nThere is very little information available about GMN Cayman, or GMN Cayman\nHoldCo\n\nVice World News was billed as a joint venture with Antenna Group, but I was\ntold that the deal\u2019s details were kept closely among the highest levels of the\ncompany. A bankruptcy filing from May 15th, 2023, reveals that Vice World News\nwas actually being paid for by an entity called GMN Cayman, and that GMN\nCayman pulled that funding after Antenna\u2019s talks to buy Vice outright fell\nthrough. Vice Media was in trouble before the deal collapsed \u2014 but between\nWipro\u2019s award for unpaid bills, which resulted in a freeze on Vice\u2019s bank\naccounts, and the loss of the Antenna deal, Chapter 11 was unavoidable. Vice\nhad already taken three forbearances on its loans.\n\nThere is very little information available about GMN Cayman, or GMN Cayman\nHoldCo, which agreed to make two payments to terminate the Vice World News\ndeal. Neither company appears to exist on Google search except in Vice\nbankruptcy documents. According to the Cayman Islands registry, GMN Cayman\u2019s\naddress is the same as a law firm in the Caymans, and it has two directors:\nFeras Houhou and Mohammed Abdullah A AlAli. Two men named Feras Houhou and\nMohammed AlAli say on their LinkedIn pages that they worked for SNB Capital,\nwhich describes itself as the \u201cinvestment banking and asset management arm of\nthe Saudi National Bank, headquartered in Riyadh.\u201d I reached out to them\nthrough LinkedIn but did not hear back in time for publication.\n\nAnd when Fortress, one of the many entities Vice owed money to, took over the\ncompany through a credit bid of $350 million \u2014 that was another \u201cShane deal,\u201d\naccording to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cThis is based on misinformed reporting,\u201d Sorzano said. \u201cWe will not comment\non internal discussions with any investor.\u201d\n\nAll the while, the compensation of executives dwarfed that of the journalists\nmaking the actual work. Just before the May 2023 bankruptcy filing, the\ncompany announced 100 layoffs, then paid out $1 million in retention bonuses\nto various executives. There\u2019s even a bankruptcy filing detailing those\nbonuses. Meanwhile, many Vice employees didn\u2019t get their promised severance as\na result of the bankruptcy.\n\nOne reporter I spoke to had been traveling back from an undercover reporting\ntrip focused on human rights violations when the production\u2019s credit card\nstarted being declined; if it had happened 24 hours earlier, the team would\nhave been in a very dicey situation. Fortunately, a supervisor was able to dig\nout an old credit card that still functioned, and that was how the group\nmanaged to fly home.\n\nA name is missing from the list of executives in the filing: Nancy Dubuc, who\nabruptly stepped down as CEO in February 2023, days after receiving the\ntermination notice from GMN Cayman. It\u2019s odd that she doesn\u2019t appear in the\nfiling, though she was CEO during some of the time period it captures. (She\nmade an annual salary of more than $1.5 million, according to The New York\nTimes.) But then, three sources told me that they felt that escaping\nresponsibility was a major part of her tenure as CEO.\n\n\u201cI am proud to leave a Vice better than the one I joined,\u201d Dubuc wrote in a\nmemo to staff announcing her departure, three months before the company\u2019s\nbankruptcy.\n\nSeveral people told me Vice remained messy under Dixon\n\nDubuc declined to comment on the Antenna deal, Vice\u2019s inability to pay its\nbills, her leadership style, and the executives she surrounded herself with at\nthe company. Vice declined to comment on its Chapter 11 filings.\n\nAfter Dubuc left the company last year, two CEOs were appointed: Hozefa\nLokhandwala, who was the chief strategy officer, and Bruce Dixon, then the CFO\nof Vice Studios. Before the year was over, Lokhandwala was out \u2014 forced out, a\nperson familiar with the matter told me. Lokhandwala did not respond to a\nrequest for comment.\n\nJesse Angelo abruptly quit the company shortly after Dubuc\u2019s departure. \u201cI\ndecided to leave Vice because I believed that the board and new co-CEOs,\nhaving already failed to close two transactions, did not have a strategic\nvision for the company and were steering it towards bankruptcy,\u201d he said in an\nemailed statement.\n\nSeveral people told me Vice remained messy under Dixon. After laying off\nhundreds in February, executives held a virtual town hall meeting. They\nmistakenly invited a handful of recently laid-off workers, who blitzed them\nwith thumbs-down emoji. The execs ended the meeting abruptly. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible\nto ignore the emojis,\u201d Dixon said.\n\nVice also canceled its contract with Slack, so staffers started using an\ninstance spun up from their personal email addresses\n\n\u201cBruce continues to execute a strategy, backed by the board, that will lead to\na more successful company,\u201d said Vice spokesperson Sorzano.\n\nVice also canceled its contract with Slack, so staffers started using an\ninstance spun up from their personal email addresses. Since it was what most\nemployees used when the layoffs happened, the company had no way of removing\nfired workers from Slack, according to two sources. Sorzano, the Vice\nspokesperson, declined to comment on this.\n\nWhat\u2019s left now is Vice Studios, which is focused on video work for social\nplatforms. There is some reason to be optimistic: Dixon worked for BBC\nWorldwide and Pulse Films before Vice \u2014 this is the business he knows best.\n(Pulse Films was acquired by Vice, but its founders are still owed the money\nfrom the buyout.)\n\nHere is what Sorzano, the Vice spokesperson, had to say about the company as\nof now:\n\n> This is the end of a chapter \u2013 not the book \u2013 for Vice. Any reporting to the\n> contrary is both short-term and short-sighted as it misunderstands Vice\u2019s\n> strategy going forward.\n>\n> The company is reconfiguring during a time of dramatic change and upheaval\n> in the media sector. Vice is shifting to a studio model \u2013 producing and\n> providing best-in-class content to distributors around the world. We have a\n> multi-award-winning film, documentary, and television studio; a Vice\n> television network; and a strategic and creative agency that represents some\n> of the world\u2019s best-known brands.\n>\n> As we have previously stated, Vice has exited the costly day-to-day news\n> business, and we have restructured our workforce in line with our\n> streamlined operating model.\n>\n> There continues to be tremendous interest in the Vice brand.\n\nDespite all the talent in the junior and middle ranks, Vice did not build out\na robust business operation. But then, maybe that wasn\u2019t the point. One former\nVice staffer called the company \u201can executive enrichment scheme.\u201d\n\nVice was a certainly a good way for Shane Smith to make money and flex\ninfluence. Several people I spoke to wondered if that was really all Vice ever\nwas. Smith got some of his money out on top, selling $100 million of his Vice\nshares in 2014. On an episode of Desus & Mero in 2017, Smith discussed\ninvesting his money by buying a $25,000 Pablo Picasso plate. Smith\u2019s divorce\nfiling showed he made $1.6 million per year, plus $1,400 a month in\n\u201cperquisites,\u201d according to Business Insider. In 2021, Smith sold one of his\nhomes in Los Angeles for $48.7 million, according to Mansion Global.\n\nSmith called himself \u201cpost-economic\u201d\n\nSmith has always been an incredible salesman. In a 2015 interview, Smith is\nclear about where the responsibility for Vice lies: \u201cI vote 95 percent of the\nboard,\u201d he said. He gave up voting control in 2021 only after the SPAC\nfailure. Still, the era of the Shane deal may not be totally over: he is\nreportedly looking for capital to buy Vice back. Shane Smith did not respond\nto requests for comment.\n\nVice\u2019s creditors can only expect 1 or 2 percent of their money back after\nbankruptcy. Vice spokesperson Sorzano declined to comment on the Chapter 11\nproceedings.\n\nOn an episode of the Joe Rogan podcast in 2014, Smith called himself \u201cpost-\neconomic.\u201d In a very different way, Vice Media is now post-economic, too.\n\nMost Popular\n\nMost Popular\n\n  1. ## Microsoft is confident Windows on Arm could finally beat Apple\n\n  2. ## Elon Musk says his posts did more to \u2018financially impair\u2019 X than help it\n\n  3. ## Google\u2019s Pixel 8 and 8 Pro can now be located even with a dead battery\n\n  4. ## The total eclipse shows us how important solar energy is to the US\n\n  5. ## Google\u2019s Nest Secure is shutting down today \u2014 and you\u2019ve got options besides ADT\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From\n\n## More from Features\n\n  * ### Indie, rocked\n\n  * ### The Echo Hub is Alexa\u2019s missing piece\n\n  * ### \u2018Burning Man for rednecks\u2019: inside the King of the Hammers off-road race\n\n  * ### The text file that runs the internet\n\n  * Advertiser Content From\n\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy Notice\n  * Cookie Policy\n  * Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Info\n  * Licensing FAQ\n  * Accessibility\n  * Platform Status\n  * How We Rate and Review Products\n\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Community Guidelines\n  * About\n  * Ethics Statement\n\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Jobs @ Vox Media\n\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
