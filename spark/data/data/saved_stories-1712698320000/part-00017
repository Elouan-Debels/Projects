But that\u2019s not what his tweet said\u2014and in any event, no\npresident has the power to delay Election Day.\n\n\u201cThe president is simply raising a question, whereas Democrats are proposing\nan entirely new system (of massive mail-in voting) that will result in\nenormous delays in the election results,\u201d a senior Trump administration\nofficial told Fox News Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn a morning tweet, the president wrote: \u201cWith Universal Mail-In Voting (not\nAbsentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT\nElection in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the\nElection until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\u201d\n\nAs I have explained previously, only Congress has the constitutional authority\nto change the date of the federal general election.\n\nArticle I, Section 4 of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to set\nthe \u201cTimes, Places and Manner\u201d of congressional elections. Similarly, Article\nII, Section 1 gives Congress the authority to set the date on which we vote\nfor the slates of presidential electors through the Electoral College.\n\nThe date for both congressional and presidential elections has been set by law\nas the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November since 1845.\n\nCongress could delay the November election if it passed an amendment to\nfederal law and the president signed it. But the likelihood of that happening\nis virtually nil, and this was made clear by bipartisan criticism of the\npresident\u2019s morning tweet from House and Senate members.\n\nCongress has never delayed a federal election, even during the Civil War and\nWorld War II. Doing so would be a mistake, and it\u2019s clear that isn\u2019t going to\nhappen.\n\nDespite the coronavirus pandemic, experience shows that we can vote safely in-\nperson as long as election officials implement the safety protocols\nrecommended by health experts in polling places\u2014the same protocols we are all\nusing when we go to the grocery store or pharmacy.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released such guidelines June\n22. I voted safely in-person in my town council election recently in Virginia\nwith those types of health precautions in place.\n\nEven during the coronavirus pandemic that has so disrupted our lives, it would\nbe a mistake to go to an all-mail election. Concerns that Trump has raised\nabout mail-in voting are based on documented problems we have seen with such\nvoting.\n\nMail-in ballots are the ballots most vulnerable to being altered, stolen, or\nforged. Just look at the current investigation going on in Paterson, New\nJersey, over a recent municipal election conducted entirely by mail.\n\nFour Paterson residents have already been charged with criminal election\nfraud, including a councilman and councilman-elect. Evidence is surfacing of\neverything from voters reporting that they never received their absentee\nballots (even though they are recorded as having voted) to accusations that\none of the campaigns may have submitted fraudulent ballots.\n\nMail-in ballots also have a higher rejection rate than votes cast in person.\nIn the Paterson case, election officials apparently rejected 1 in 5 ballots\nfor everything from signatures on the ballots not matching the signatures of\nvoters on file, to ballots not complying with the technical rules that apply\nto absentee ballots.\n\nNew York, which has taken more than a month to count the ballots from its June\n23 primary election, is also reporting a similar rejection rate. This should\nbe considered unacceptable by anyone believing in fair and accurate elections.\n\nThese kinds of technical problems\u2014when a voter doesn\u2019t provide all of the\ninformation required with an absentee ballot\u2014occur because there is no\nelection official in people\u2019s homes to answer their questions. At polling\nplaces, by contrast, election officials can try to remedy any problems a voter\nencounters.\n\nThen there is the problem of mail-in ballots being miscarried or not delivered\nby the U.S. Postal Service. States with recent primaries, including Wisconsin\nand Maryland, have reported voters not receiving their ballots or not getting\nthem in time to be voted and returned.\n\nIn addition, there have been problems with the Postal Service not postmarking\nballots, making it impossible for election officials to determine whether the\nballots were mailed in time to be counted. The U.S. Election Assistance\nCommission says that in the last four federal elections, 2.7 million mail-in\nballots were misdelivered and 1.3 million were rejected by election officials.\n\nIn the 2016 election, almost 130 million Americans voted. Does anyone really\nthink the Postal Service will be able to suddenly handle 260 million pieces of\nadditional mail\u2014that is, the ballots being mailed out by election officials,\nand then mailed back by voters?\n\nJust from a practical standpoint, that is asking for chaos and mass\ndisenfranchisement.\n\nInevitably, it will take longer to tabulate the results of the election if\nthere is a massive amount of mail-in voting, particularly in close races for\nthe presidency and down-ballot offices.\n\nBut if the outcome of the election is still in doubt by Jan. 20, 2021\u2014the day\nthe Constitution says the winner of the presidential election is supposed to\nbe sworn into office\u2014due to litigation and/or the long delays in counting\nmailed ballots, the 20th Amendment to the Constitution provides that Congress\n\u201cmay by law provide ... who shall then act as President.\u201d\n\nUnder 3 U.S.C. \u00a7 19, Congress has provided that the speaker of the House shall\nupon his or her \u201cresignation as Speaker and Representative\u201d act as president\nuntil a president or vice president has been determined.\n\nAmericans should insist on their right to vote in-person in their polling\nplaces in November, where they can be sure their ballots are safely received\nand counted.\n\nNo one disputes that those most at risk from the coronavirus pandemic may want\nto vote by absentee ballot. But as The New York Times correctly said back in\n2012, \u201cvotes cast by mail are less likely to be counted, more likely to be\ncompromised and more likely to be contested than those cast in a voting\nbooth.\u201d\n\nThat assessment is just as true today as it was eight years ago. Voters should\nnot be forced to deal with the problems that massive voting by mail would\ncreate.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in Fox News\n\nMore on This Issue\n\n## Election Integrity\n\nREPORT 15 min read\n\nMisreading of the NVRA Preventing Efforts to Stop Duplicate Voter Registration\n\nTESTIMONY 27 min read\n\nThe Right Side of History: Protecting Voting Rights in America\n\nTESTIMONY 13 min read\n\nHouse Bill 1264 Would Make Indiana\u2019s Elections More Secure\n\nSubscribe to email updates\n\nFollow us\n\nPrivacy Policy Copyright\n\n\u00a9 2024, The Heritage Foundation\n\n", "frontpage": false}
