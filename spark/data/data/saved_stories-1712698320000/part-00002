A collaborative network comprising mobile and stationary Internet of\nThings (IoT) devices that are furnished with gas sensors, along with a remote\nserver, constructs a resilient framework that monitors the concentrations of\nharmful emissions, characterizes the ambient air quality of the vicinity where\nthe fire transpires, adopting European Air Quality levels, and communicates\nthe outcomes via suitable applications (RESTful APIs and visualizations) to\nthe stakeholders responsible for fire management decision making. Different\nexperimental evaluations adopting separate contexts illustrate the operation\nof the infrastructure.\n\nKeywords:\n\nair quality monitoring; health impact; fire management; emergency management;\nrestful API\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nWildfires are one of the most common natural disasters in many regions, most\ncommonly across the Mediterranean Sea and areas in the taiga biome. The\nprofound impact of wildfires is evident not only in the destruction of\nlandscapes but also in the significant health risks posed to the wildland\nfirefighters engaged in extinguishing these fires. Large amounts of gaseous\nemissions and particulate matter are emitted from fire and smoke due to\nbiomass burning. Wildland firefighters are exposed to high concentrations of\nthese pollutants for an extended amount of hours, resulting in a severe and\nimmediate health impact. According to [1], there are acute health effects from\nsmoke exposure, mostly involving lung functioning, pathological issues, as\nwell as long-term effects, such as cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer.\nThe research results presented in [2] show that prolonged exposure to wildfire\nsmoke increases premature mortality, respiratory issues and increased\npopulation cancer risk, with a higher occurrence of lung cancer and wider\nrespiratory complications.These problems manifest themselves immediately,\nusually from the first time the firefighters are exposed to wildfire. When a\nwildfire occurs, firefighters are usually under constant toxic smoke exposure\nfor many hours, lacking adequate protection equipment since there are none\nthat meet the specification of relevant associations, forcing them to resort\nto protection solutions, such as bandanas or heat-resistant shrouds, which\noffer limited or no pollutant protection. According to [3], these solutions\nhave been proven to be ineffective for total particulate matter filtration. In\n[4], the authors state that direct evaluations of the performance of\nrespirators for wildland firefighters are disjointed since the use of\ndifferent respiratory protection methods is impractical for several reasons,\nsuch as short-term protection against long-term occupation, the weight of the\nequipment and the reduced mobility of the equipment, suggesting that more\nprescribed burn studies be conducted as well as researching more effective\nrespiratory protection methods.Besides serious health concerns, the research\nin [5] measured the blood pressure and heart conditions of the wildland\nfirefighters the day before, after and the morning following prescribed fires,\nresulting in a reduction in systolic blood pressure and increases in heart\nrate immediately after and the following morning, most likely resulting from\nmultiple fireline factors, such as exposure to fire and smoke, the temperature\nand the tasks.\n\nThe composition of the smoke from wildfires further compounds the health risks\nfaced by firefighters. Studies by [1,6] reveal that the smoke contains\nmultiple pollutants resulting from biomass burning. These pollutants manifest\nin gases and particulate matter forms. They are composed of mainly carbon\ncontent, most of it being carbon dioxide (CO_2) and carbon monoxide (CO),\nparticulate matter of an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 \u03bcm^3 (PM_2.5),\nand inorganic gases, hydrocarbons, oxygenated hydrocarbons, trace metals and\nother particulate matter of different diameters. Complex compounds were also\nidentified, such as formaldehyde and benzene [6]. Inhaling quantities that\nexceed a specified limit leads to serious health issues as described above.\nMost of the time, firefighters are exposed, substantially inhaling these\nemissions. Under these conditions, wildland firefighters stay out of the smoke\nwhen they can and try to breath clean air, whenever possible. Of course, such\nmovement is perceived by firefighters using their senses. Hence, the\nperception of pollutants in the air is significantly reduced, potentially\nleading to decisions that still do not prevent wildland firefighters from\ninhaling emissions. It can easily be understood that the point of interest is\nto avoid exposure in large quantities of smoke and fire emissions.\n\nThe deflection of exposure to pollutants can be achieved by the constant\nknowledge of air quality in the place of interest. In order to maintain\nconstant knowledge, the utilization of monitoring techniques is necessary.\nModern monitoring is achieved through Internet of Things (IoT). Internet of\nThings integrates multiple technologies, such as communication protocols,\nwireless technologies, edge computing, cloud computing, security technologies,\nembedded systems and machine learning and artificial intelligence. The\nintegration of these technologies permits IoT to be applied to a multitude of\nfields, such as health, environment, agriculture, industry and household. The\nfundamental concept of the IoT is the connection between multiple objects over\nIP networks. These objects are capable of communication, sensing and,\nnowadays, intelligence. Such capabilities enable the constant observation of\nair quality and the distribution of these data through the Internet in real\ntime, achieving real-time monitoring and decision making.\n\nIn this paper, we present a monitoring IoT system for detecting and recording\nthe air quality, pollutants of the fire and smoke from wildfires for\nfirefighters. The functionalities of this system revolve around the real-time\nobservation of pollutant values, constant data transmission to the\nheadquarters and data storage and manipulation. The observation of pollutants\nis realized through a wireless network, containing multiple sensor systems\ncommunicating with a remote server. The server is responsible for data storing\nand manipulation and real-time visualization of the pollutant values and the\nquality of the air. The observation component collects information regarding\nthe pollutants as well as geospatial information. This system can benefit\nwildland firefighters in many ways. First and foremost, they are provided with\nreal-time precise knowledge of the quality of the air on their location.\nHence, this knowledge can assist in decision making, resolving the safe\ndistancing from the smoke and fire. The benefits of this is the health safety\nof the wildland firefighters as well as maintaining strength during fire\nextinguishing. Aside from direct benefits to firefighters, the data collected\ncan be used to predict the behavior of wildfires. Thus, more efficient\nplanning and resource allocation can be achieved.\n\nThe structure of the remaining paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the\nrelevant related work. Section 3 describes the architecture of the sensors and\nthe server. Section 4 describes the applied technologies for the development\nas well as the REST API interface for communication between the server and the\nportable solutions and the stationary solutions. Section 5 presents the\nexperimental evaluation of the portable solution under different fire\ncombustion conditions. Finally, Section 6 concludes the findings of this work,\nproviding future work suggestions on top of this work.\n\n## 2\\. Related Work\n\nMonitoring firefighters has been thoroughly studied and because of the\ntechnological advancements in the hardware, many applications have been\nimplemented for monitoring them during fire suppression, both in outdoor and\nindoor environments. Several studies have monitored physiological and physical\nparameters, as well as the safety of firefighters. However, monitoring air\nquality in a wildfire environment has hardly been examined. This is because\nthe main interest is shifted in the situation of the firefighters at the time\nof fire suppression. Such systems utilize a set of sensors responsible for\nmeasuring these parameters, as well as a processing unit, and they usually\noperate under a network, between the firefighter and the headquarters. Their\nfeatures in their designs differentiate along several axes. The location where\nsuch systems are placed vary significantly. The most common approach is a\nwearable device, where the system is developed for the firefighters to wear it\non their body. The location of the device can be the hands [7,8,9,10,11], the\nhead [12] or in multiple locations on the body [13]. Wearable devices are the\nmost common approach in these systems, as they offer multiple ways to\nimplement the components of such systems. Subsequently, some systems have\ntaken this idea one step further and have developed an intelligent suit\n[14,15,16,17,18,19], which integrates the sensor and processing unit inside\nthe suit, resulting in a compacted system. Aside from wearable designs, some\nstudies present non-wearable approaches [12], which limits the capability to\nacquire vitals from firefighters.\n\nThe physiological and physical parameters recorded from these devices vary for\neach system as well. Most studies include physiological parameters, such as\nheart rate, pulse rate, epidermal temperature and blood pressure\n[7,9,10,11,12,15,17,18,19], which are meant to indicate the status of the\nfirefighter. For example, [15] developed an intelligent garment responsible\nfor monitoring the physiological state of the firefighter through an\nelectrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, an electromyogram, respiration,\nblood volume pulse, as well as from other physical parameters, specifically\ntemperature and motion measurements through an accelerometer. Physical\nparameters, such as temperature, humidity and body movement detection through\nacceleration, are considered in the implementation of most systems\n[7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,17,18,20]. Acquiring such values expands the\ncapabilities of firefighters\u2019 health monitoring since aside from physiological\nvalues, vital signs such as motion or posture can be extracted. Regarding air\nquality, a smaller number of studies join air quality monitoring with the rest\nof the system [7,11,17,18,20].\n\nSimilarly, many studies resolving air quality monitoring have been proposed;\nwhile they follow the same idea as the firefighter-monitoring devices, they\nare not worn (wearable device or intelligent garment). These applications\nmeasure pathogenic emissions from gasses [21], particulate matter [22] or both\n[23,24,25,26,27,28,29], where some focus on measuring the Air Quality Index\n(AQI) of the environment [21,22,24,25], although none of the latter provide\nany information about the wildfire environments.\n\nThe communication infrastructure varies as well, as it depends on the location\nof the monitoring system. A popular technology used is Wi-Fi, which is used\nfor systems inside urban areas [20,21,22,26,29] or industrial areas [28],\nwhile for firefighter-monitoring systems, it is used for communication between\na more powerful intermediate device (mobile phone [10] or a broker [7]), or\ncapable processing units (such as Raspberry Pi). For longer ranges with less\npower consumption, technologies like LoRaWAN [9,12,13,23,25] and ZigBee/XBee\n[7,14] are utilized. When no remote server is required and the data are\ndisplayed locally, Bluetooth or other small-range technologies are used\n[8,11,15,16,17,18,19,24,27].\n\nTable 1 and Table 2 demonstrate the aforementioned monitoring solutions\naccompanied by some aspects of their implementation.\n\nTable 1. Firefighter-monitoring solutions.\n\nTable 2. Environmental monitoring solutions.\n\n## 3\\. System Architecture\n\nFigure 1 demonstrates an overview of the Health Impact Assessment system. This\nsystem is built upon three core components: (i) a portable and a (ii)\nstationary solution dedicated to monitoring air quality, particularly in the\ncontext of individuals exposed to a wildfire incident, alongside (iii) a web\napplication managing the data flow from these solutions. The first component\ntargets equipping frontline first-responders, particularly firefighters, with\na compact node housing a Raspberry Pi, five emission sensors, and a\ncommunication unit. Data from these nodes are seamlessly transmitted and\nrecorded in a MONGODB (https://www.mongodb.com/, accessed on 3 March 2024)\ndatabase through PUT requests directed at specific endpoints. The second\ncomponent, the stationary solution, comprises a set of Libelium Smart Spot\nmodels strategically positioned in safe areas near the wildfire incident.\nThese devices are well suited for monitoring various environmental factors\nsuch as air quality, temperature, and humidity. Data from these devices are\ntransferred via an (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) MQTT\n(https://mqtt.org/, accessed on 3 March 2024) broker to interested parties.\nFinally, the web application acts as the third component, receiving and\nstoring observations from both systems into a repository. Command centers and\nstakeholders interested in air quality and its impact on health can easily\naccess the latest emission data, AQI and spatiotemporal information through\nstraightforward GET requests to designated endpoints. Access to these\nresources requires authentication using credentials for effective utilization\nby our partners.\n\nFigure 1. System architecture overview.\n\n#### 3.1. The Portable Solution\n\nAccording to [30], the basic structure of each node consists of four basic\nunits: the sensing/identification unit, the processing unit, the communication\nunit and the power supply unit. The processing unit is responsible for\ncontrolling the components of the sensor node and performs any required\ncomputations [30] as well as data preservation. The sensing/identification\nunit is the gateway to the physical world, i.e., through it, the node can\nunderstand physical phenomena and convert them to electrical signals. The\ncommunication unit manages the communications of the node with other\ncomponents or remote server. Finally, the power supply unit supplies the\nsystem with energy and, usually, it consists of a battery and sometimes a\npower generator, such as solar panels.\n\nThe above units share some common parameters that must be taken under notice.\nSince this equipment is not fixed in position, rather being carried by\npersonnel, the dimensions and the weight of each component should be taken\nunder serious consideration because of the movement and stamina effect on the\npersonnel. In addition, the temperatures and humidity under which they can\nfunction are of the utmost importance since the environment of interest\ncontains extreme environmental conditions. Another important parameter is the\nlifespan. Although this seems trivial, a short lifespan, in addition to low\ntolerance to extreme temperature and humidity, means that the units must be\nreplaced at regular intervals, increasing the cost of maintenance of each\nnode. Finally, the accuracy of measurements of the sensing units must be\nsensitive enough in order to cover all the levels of the AQI.\n\nIn this work, we utilize the Raspberry Pi (https://www.raspberrypi.org/,\naccessed on 3 March 2024) microcomputer as the processing unit. On top of it,\nwe attach the Waveshare SIM7600E HAT\n(https://www.waveshare.com/sim7600e-h-4g-hat.htm, accessed on 3 March 2024)\nextension as the communication unit that is also responsible for providing\ngeospatial information about the location of the rescue personnel. The sensing\nunit consists of a set of sensors from DFRobot Gravity Series: four gas\nsensors (https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2516.html, accessed on 3 March 2024)\nand three particulate matter sensors\n(https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1272.html, accessed on 3 March 2024).\nFinally, for the power supply unit, we utilize the Waveshare Solar Power\nManagement (B) (https://www.waveshare.com/solar-power-manager-b.htm, accessed\non 3 March 2024) module, which operates both as a solar power energy\ntransducer and as a battery since it can store energy. The building blocks of\nthe proposed portable solution are demonstrated in detail in Figure 2. Figure\n3a illustrates an assembled final node of the portable solution, while Figure\n3b presents the inside of the sensor system and its components. The solution\u2019s\nweight is less than 1.5 kg, and its dimensions are 25 cm \u00d7 20 cm \u00d7 15 cm,\nmaking it lightweight and compact.\n\nFigure 2. Portable solution: building blocks.\n\nFigure 3. Complete portable air quality observation system. (a) Assembled\nnode. (b) Interior System and Components.\n\nThe adoption of a fully functional mini-computer like Raspberry Pi in a highly\ndemanding environment where adverse conditions prevail offers numerous\nadvantages over conventional wearables. Beyond the implementation of simple\nrepetitive tasks, such as monitoring the concentrations of fire emissions in\nour case offered by wearables and micro-controllers, the proposed solution can\nperform tasks that require more processing power and interactivity (presented\nin subsequent sections). It is also easier to expand its capabilities\nindicatively by adding other sensors (i.e., meteorological and biometrics)\nand/or providing new functionality like incorporating machine/federated\nlearning algorithms to predict the expansion progress of the pollutants\nemitted by the fire occurrence [31]. Finally, this solution can be mounted on\nUGVs (Unmanned Ground Vehicles), UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), and fire\ntrucks, while it could be used in safe shelters as well.\n\nAs far as the drawbacks of the proposed solution are concerned, they are\nassociated with the impact on the costs of communication and energy. The use\nof HTTP is expensive in communication resources, causing more overhead over\nthe network, and requires more mobile data consumption compared to other\ncommunication protocols in the literature, despite the handy infrastructure\nfor REST API. The system\u2019s power consumption is greater due to the usage of\nRaspberry Pi, alongside 4 I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) sensors, the 1 UART\n(Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) sensor and 1 UART 4G HAT,\ninstead of a mere MCU (Micro-Controller Unit). Although the inclusion of the\npower unit is not advisable for environments in which high temperatures and\nintense smoke prevail, an alternative power supply will be sought in a future\nversion in order to better adapt to such difficult conditions. Cooling methods\nsuch as fans and heatsinks could also be explored to keep the equipment from\nthermally throttling. In any case, it is possible to exploit the built-in\nsensor and the corresponding interface of the Raspberry Pis to inform their\nusers (with appropriate messages) about the temperature levels of the CPUs.\nTwo concerns that must be finally taken into account pertain to the\naccumulation of fatigue resulting from the transportation of the portable\nsolution in the field over extended periods, despite its relatively light\nweight, and the adequate training of users to effectively address potential\nissues that may arise from its use (e.g., inability to connect via 5G and\nattempt to exploit available mesh-in-the-sky network).\n\nThe challenges encountered during the implementation of the portable devices\ninclude the following: (a) Both the PM_2.5 sensors and HAT communicate with\nthe Raspberry Pi using the same data transfer protocol (UART). To prevent data\ntransfer conflicts, we need to create two UART communication\nchannels/interfaces. (b) Despite all sensors being calibrated by the\nmanufacturer, the provided library for the PM_2.5 sensor is not available in\nPython. Therefore, we have to implement it from scratch.\n\n#### 3.1.1. The Sensing Unit\n\nThere are numerous metrics used in order to evaluate the AQI. The metric we\nuse is the European Air Quality Index (EAQI). This metric is based on the\nconcentrations of five different pollutants, specifically, the concentration\nof the gasses O_3, NO_2 and SO_2, the particulate matter of diameter 2.5 \u03bcm\n(PM_2.5), and the particulate matter of diameter 10 \u03bcm (PM_10). This index is\nused over other indices proposed in the literature since it is more beneficial\nthan others. Table 3 shows the index levels of the AQI and the corresponding\nvalues of the pollutants. In order to evaluate the air quality of the\nenvironment, we should compute the corresponding index level for each\npollutant and compare these values. The maximum index level values indicate\nthe air quality of the environment. Alongside the aforementioned pollutants,\nanother gas sensor is also used. It observes carbon monoxide emissions. This\nsensor is used for smoke detection and can provide information about the\nthickness of the smoke and if there is danger of asphyxiation for personnel.\n\nTable 3. European Air Quality Index (measured in \u03bcg/m^3).\n\n#### 3.1.2. The Communication Unit\n\nAs stated previously, the communication unit consists of an extension attached\nto the processing unit. This extension, in order to be able to provide\ncommunication functionalities, comes with two antennas, i.e., a GPS and a 4G\nantenna. Since the communication is transmitted over the public switched\nnetwork, a SIM card is required. The SIM card can be a configurable IoT\napplication specific card or a typical market card with sufficient mobile\ndata. The integrated modem is fully programmable and provides capabilities\nboth for data transmission and geospatial information gathering, through the\nGPS antenna.\n\nThe extension is fully capable of transmitting over 4G LTE, like in previous\ngenerations. It can transmit a prosperous amount of data in a short amount of\ntime (up to 100 Mbps), given the capability to concurrently transmit data from\nnumerous nodes, given that the amount of data transmitted is small enough.\nThis is useful in emergency cases, where the quality of air worsens faster and\nfaster, or the location of the personnel changes abnormally and they cannot\nrespond to the monitoring department.\n\n#### 3.1.3. The Processing Unit\n\nRaspberry Pi is the primary contestant as a processing unit for such types of\napplications. This microcomputer offers a variety of applications that can be\nused to ease the development of such systems. Although it has higher energy\nconsumption compared to other processing units (for example, Arduino and\nESP32), it offers more functionalities and ease of software implementation and\nmaintenance. Many sensors offer libraries that are implemented for Python (the\nbasic language that comes with Raspberry Pi). Alongside the software\nsolutions, Raspberry Pi comes with support for all the standard data\ntransmission protocols, allowing multiple connections for these protocols.\nThis restricts the additional hardware equipment (e.g., multiplexers),\nreducing the size of the node as well as the cost and complexity.\n\nThe main algorithm that the Raspberry Pi implements is shown in Figure 4. The\ncommunication unit initialization is performed with the help of an external\ncommand line application, the ModemManager, for enabling the modem for\ncommunication, and another application, udhcp for providing a dynamic IP. The\nemissions that are read from the sensors are temporarily stored in a buffer as\na batch. When the buffer has reached a specified amount of records, then the\naverage of the batch is sent to the server. Additionally, geospatial\ninformation as well as the unique identifier of the node are attached. The\ngeospatial information is provided by the connection unit. The authentication\nis performed using unique credentials for each node. The credentials consist\nof a unique username and a password. Authentication is required since the\nendpoint communication is performed with a JSON Web Token (JWT) (more details\nare provided later).\n\nFigure 4. Raspberry Pi algorithm.\n\n#### 3.1.4. The Power Supply Unit\n\nThe power supply of this system consists of a Waveshare Solar Power Manager\n(B), which functions as battery of a solar panel, although it can be also used\nindividually without the adoption of the solar panel. The battery holds up to\n10,000 mAh of power storage, offering adequate power for the running system.\n\n#### 3.2. The Stationary Solution\n\nWe utilize a range of sensors beyond those used by firefighters to monitor\nwildfire spread in forests. Specifically, we leverage the Libelium Smart Spot\nmodel (https://www.libelium.com/iot-products/smart-spot/, accessed on 3 March\n2024) (Figure 5). Table 4 presents the specifications of the stationary\nsolution adopted. These ready-made solutions accommodate various IoT\napplications, including air assessment and environmental aspects. Smart Spot\nmanagement can be accomplished by using a dedicated platform. The platform\nencompasses diverse functionalities crucial for effective device management,\ne.g., monitoring of device status, and connectivity options. A visualization\ndashboard is also enabled. Two panels are integrated to visually represent the\npresence of gases (NO_2 and O_3) and particulate matter (PM_10, PM_2.5, and\nPM_1) within the proximity of the deployed smart spot devices.\n\nFigure 5. Smart Spot\u2014IoT device for environmental parameter sensing.\n\nTable 4. Libelium Smart Spot specifications.\n\nFigure 6a,b illustrate pollutant measurements for O_3 and PM_2.5 within a\nspecific geographical zone, respectively.\n\nFigure 6. Smart Spot visualization dashboard. (a) O_3. (b) PM_2.5.\n\n## 4\\. Data Manipulation and Knowledge Extraction\n\nThe continuous operation and seamless request handling of the web application\nrequire the utilization of a dedicated web server. Our web server consists of\ntwo (2) software solutions, i.e., Gunicorn (https://gunicorn.org/, 4 March\n2024) and Nginx (https://www.nginx.com/, accessed on 3 March 2024). The\nGunicorn server provides the Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)\nestablished to allow different Python web applications to communicate with the\nweb server program. Typically, a web server program communicates with a\nbackend application using an interface. For back-end applications written in\nPython, the standard interface for the servers is WSGI. Gunicorn eliminates\nthe need for additional configurations. However, Gunicorn\u2019s limitations in\nhandling network congestion, load balancing, and scalability highlight the\nnecessity for a supplementary solution. For this reason, the Nginx server is\nimplemented to enhance the application\u2019s scalability and tackle security\nconcerns. Figure 7 presents the server\u2019s setup, i.e., the specifications and\nthe integrated software components.\n\nFigure 7. Server characteristics and integrated components.\n\n#### 4.1. Portable Solution\u2014REST API\n\nSince a Raspberry Pi has limited resources, it cannot efficiently manage\nextensive data storage without compromising its ability to collect real-time\ndata. Thus, offloading data storage to a more capable system (like a web\napplication server) can ensure that real-time data collection is retained. The\ndata collected from the sensors are stored within a web application. This\ncentralized storage is essential to ensure the data remain in one accessible\nlocation for end users. The web application is designed to communicate not\nonly with the Raspberry Pis but also with interested parties seeking access to\nthe data and AQI. It operates on a REST API, facilitating data exchange with\nother applications. The information obtained from the sensors is stored and\norganized using a NoSQL database, while access to the API endpoints requires\nuser authentication. The system supports a robust authentication mechanism,\nemploying basic authentication with roles for user management and access\ncontrol. The RESTful application is implemented in Python, using the Flask\nframework, and the database management system used to store the data is\nMongoDB. The RESTful application comprises five endpoints, allowing users to\nretrieve data directly from the database. Access to these endpoints is\nrestricted solely to verified users possessing specific roles, with each\nendpoint having distinct role-based access. Table 5 summarizes the deployed\nendpoints.\n\nTable 5. Endpoints description.\n\nEndpoint: insert-data. This endpoint is periodically called from Raspberry Pis\nto send the data they have collected to the web server. They contain the\nconcentration values of the observed emissions, geographical coordinates, and\na unique id. These data are just collected and not processed in the Raspberry\nPi. The processing is performed on the server. The data are sent in JSON form\nas shown in Listing 1. The web application then registers these in two\ncollections, one which contains only the concentrations of the emissions and\none which contains the calculated EAQI.\n\nListing 1. /insert endpoint sent a JSON file.  \n---  \n{ \u201cEmissions\u201d: { \u201cCO\u201d: 1.3, \u201cSO2\u201d: 0.0, \u201cNO2\u201d: 0.02, \u201cO3\u201d: 0.01, \u201cPM1.0\u201d: 3,\n\u201cPM2.5\u201d: 4, \u201cPM10.0\u201d: 7, }, \u201cPi_id\u201d: 1, \u201cCoordinates\u201d: [38.89709, 22.43608] }  \n  \nEndpoint: get-latest-data. Using this endpoint, authenticated users can access\nthe database and retrieve the latest chronologically registered data, added\nfrom the Raspberry Pi. Users can specify the amount of data they intend to\nretrieve by inserting it into the URL as an HTTP header argument, formatted as\n?emissions=<number>. Data are returned as a list of JSON files in\nchronological order.\n\nEndpoint: aqi. This endpoint is used to retrieve the most recently registered\nAQI. It returns a JSON file containing information about the AQI, as shown in\nListing 2.\n\nBefore delving into more details about the /data-metadata endpoint, we should\ndiscuss the Data Ingestion Pipeline (DIP) provided by the SILVANUS project.\nDIP is a part of the Big Data framework, which serves as a fundamental system\nintegrating components for handling data ingestion, storage, transformation,\nand processing. It forms the backbone of SILVANUS, facilitating the creation\nof diverse user software components that can be flexibly deployed across\ndifferent platforms. Within the Big Data framework, the DIP component is\nemployed to ingest, annotate, and preprocess various data from multiple\nproviders into the storage layer. The DIP directly communicates with the\nSILVANUS Storage Abstraction Layer (SAL) through a REST API, acting as a\nmediator between data sources, software components, and the system\u2019s object\nstore. The SAL exposes an abstract POST HTTP endpoint responsible for\ningesting all data from the DIP. As part of this process, the DIP sends both\nthe actual data and its associated metadata to the SAL via a specific\nendpoint. SAL then processes the input, validates the metadata, and confirms\nthat there are no data duplicates. Finally, stored data are forwarded to\ninterested parties via the message bus, implemented by the RabbitMQ\n(https://www.rabbitmq.com/, accessed on 3 March 2024) message broker.\n\nListing 2. /aqi endpoint retrieved JSON file.  \n---  \n{ \u201cAQI\u201d: \u201cGood\u201d, \u201cposition\u201d: { \u201cLatitude\u201d: 38.89709, \u201cLongitude\u201d: 22.43608 },\n\u201cradius\u201d: 2, \u201csensorId\u201d: 0, \u201ctimestamp\u201d: \u201c2024-01-14T10:23:33.675506Z\u201d }  \n  \nEndpoint: data-metadata. This endpoint periodically posts a multipart HTTP\nrequest to the SAL. Two json files are ingested, namely data.json and\nmetadata.json. The former file contains a structured representation of data,\nspecifically related to air quality sensor readings, while the latter file\ncontains metadata information associated with the data.json file.\n\nEndpoint: data-visualize. This endpoint fulfills the need for data\nvisualization in real-time by rendering a dynamic site that plots a bar chart\nand a line chart. Based on the latest data registered, the line chart consists\nof five lines, each corresponding to an emission that is used in the\ncalculation of the AQI, while the bar chart presents the actual air-quality\nlevels. Both plots are updated when new emissions observations are registered\nin the database.\n\nThe communication scheme between the component and the web server is as\nfollows: the Raspberry Pi sends a POST request, in order to login and obtain a\nunique JSON Web Token (JWT). Then, it periodically sends an HTTP POST method\nrequest with the data collected from the sensors and the GPS. The data\ncorresponding to sensors are the mean of several previous observations e.g.,\nfive observations per request. This translates into reduced bandwidth\nconsumption, maintaining frequent transmissions of crucial information.\nWhenever the firefighter terminates the operation of the device, the Raspberry\nPi sends an HTTP DELETE request to logout and terminate the connection with\nthe web server. It is worth noting that each request involves synchronization\n(SYN), acknowledgment (ACK) and termination (FIN) messages. Prior to sending\nthe request, a SYN packet is sent from the Raspberry Pi to the server. This\ntriggers a response from the server in the form of a SYN with ACK packet. The\nRaspberry Pi then transmits the POST request, and the server responds with two\nACK packets: one for confirming receipt of the request and another before\nsending the response. Upon receiving the response, the Raspberry Pi sends the\nconfirmed receipt with an ACK packet, followed by a FIN and ACK packet to end\nthe connection. The server concludes the session by transmitting a FIN ACK\npacket, and the Raspberry Pi responds with an ACK packet. Table 6 and Table 7\ndemonstrate the communication protocols and the length of each request and\nresponse, respectively.\n\nTable 6. Requests.\n\nTable 7. Responses.\n\nThe total payload for each separate request is summarized herein. The data\ntransmission from the client device to the server has a total length of 2282\nbytes for both the request and the response, while the JSON containing the\nobservations is only 199 bytes, and the authentication token is 315 bytes. For\nthe authentication, both the request and the response cost the network\ncapacity 1597 bytes, with the length of the JSON being only 42 bytes. The\nlogin-out requires, for both the request and the response, 1437 bytes, with\nthe response JSON having a length of only 22 bytes. The data transmission\nrequest is frequently repeated, with the frequency of each repetition being\ndetermined by the number of samples required to yield the mean. We arbitrary\nchoose to collect five samples to yield the mean. This approximately results\nin 2.282 bytes/8 s = 286 bytes/s both for the request and the response. The\nauthentication and logout requests are performed once, so we can calculate the\ntransfer rate for these requests as 1597 bytes/s and 1437 bytes/s\ncorrespondingly. Throughout this communication process, it is worth noting\nthat each ACK packet is 66 bytes in length, resulting in a total of 7 packets\n(66 bytes \u00d7 7 = 462 bytes). Similarly, each SYN packet is 74 bytes in length,\nleading to an additional 148 bytes. In total, the communication process\nresults in a total of 610 bytes being transmitted (462 bytes for ACK packets +\n148 bytes for SYN packets).\n\n#### 4.2. Stationary Solution\u2014MQTT Broker\n\nData from this device can be transferred over using the Constrained\nApplication Protocol (https://coap.space/, accessed on 3 March 2024) or the\nMQTT. Regarding the CoAP protocol, a lightweight machine-to-machine (LwM2M\n(https://thingsboard.io/docs/reference/lwm2m-api/, accessed on 3 March 2024))\nserver is already deployed and can be accessed using the URL:\ncoap://homard.hopu.eu:5683. In this work, the MQTT protocol is used, which\nuses the publish\u2013subscribe model. In such a protocol, multiple clients connect\nand exchange information with each other through a broker, which is\nresponsible for information distribution. The main MQTT protocol\nconfigurations include (a) specifying the server host address\n(mqtt://silvanus.uth.gr, accessed on 3 March 2024) and port (1883), (b)\nsetting the keep-alive time (120), (c) defining the Last Will and Testament\n(LWT) topic (lib1attrs) and (d) setting the quality of service (QoS) for\npublished messages (1: at least once). We also select the Mosquitto\n(https://mosquitto.org/, accessed on 3 March 2024) broker, which implements\nthe MQTT protocol. Mosquitto is designed to work with simple message systems,\nespecially for devices that do not have a lot of power. It is compatible with\nthe latest MQTT protocol, it is open-source, and it offers features like\ndynamic topics and security through user verification.\n\nMQTT broker deployment and exploitation is presented in Figure 8. Initially,\nwe set up a Mosquitto MQTT broker within a Docker container hosted on our\nvirtual machine. Subsequently, we configured each equipment to publish data at\nfive-minute intervals to two specified topics, respectively (lib1attrs and\nlib2attrs). For end-users/stakeholders who possess an interest in health\nimpact, subscription to our broker is achievable through MQTT clients such as\nMQTT Explorer or the Paho (https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/, accessed on 3\nMarch 2024) package in Python. Portainer.io is also installed on our VM as a\ncontainer management tool. The operational procedure of the MQTT Explorer\n(https://mqtt-explorer.com/, accessed on 3 March 2024) client is illustrated\nin Figure 9. In this instance, a client is successfully subscribed to the\ntopic \u201clib1attrs\u201d, and at regular 5 min intervals, it receives a JSON file as\ndepicted in Listing 3.\n\nListing 3.

Broker deployment and configuration.\n\nFigure 9. MQTT explorer client.\n\nIn the context of application integration, interested parties can\nstraightforwardly incorporate our system into their operations. This is\nachieved by initiating HTTP access via our REST API. Detailed information\nabout the API is available on Postman using the following link:\nhttps://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29042250/2s9YJZ2iqE (accessed on 3\nMarch 2024). Pollutant measurements obtained from the smart spot device can be\naccessed through the MQTT protocol as outlined in Section 4.2.\n\n#### 4.3. System Scalability and Economic Feasibility\n\nAs previously mentioned in the subsections, the solution integrates MQTT and\nREST API technologies, facilitating scalability. MQTT brokers are capable of\nmanaging a considerable quantity of concurrent connections, a crucial aspect\nfor scenarios related to IoT, in which there could exist numerous devices. The\nadeptness of the broker in overseeing these connections and message\ntransmissions facilitates the efficient scalability of the MQTT protocol. In\naddition, scalability is an intrinsic characteristic of REST APIs that sets\nthem apart from other types of APIs. The inherent scalability of REST APIs is\nderived from their stateless architecture. The statelessness of REST APIs\nrefers to the absence of client state preservation by the server across\nrequests. Every interaction between a client and a server in REST APIs\nnecessitates the inclusion of all pertinent information for request\ncomprehension and processing. Managing session data or synchronizing it across\nnumerous servers is not required.\n\nThe expenditure associated with the proposed portable solution amounts to\naround EUR 1000, encompassing value-added tax, with 75% allocated to the\nexpenses related to pollutants sensors. The cost of the stationary solution is\nsimilar, including the necessary installation equipment, such as metallic\npoles and connectors. Available portable equipment can be allocated to\ndiscrete members of different firefighting teams operating in an affected area\nand, combined with the stationary ones mounted on corresponding fire trucks,\ncould effectively assess the surrounding air quality.Each piece of equipment\ncan be distributed to a team of various personnel members, e.g., about 20\u201330\npersonnel according to [32].\n\nIn terms of maintenance costs and logistical expenses for both solutions, they\nare almost negligible. The portable solution has minimal weight, resulting in\nminor logistical costs. As for the stationary solution, it is either fixed to\nthe ground or mounted on a ground vehicle (such as firetrucks), eliminating\nany associated logistical expenses. Moreover, maintenance expenses are\npractically non-existent for both solutions since sensors and components are\nknown for their robustness and reliability; they typically consist of solid-\nstate electronics and consume minimal power. Also, both solutions can be\ntroubleshooted remotely.\n\n## 5\\. Experimental Evaluation\n\nTo evaluate this work, two experimental scenarios are conducted. These\nexperiments focus on the behavior of the portable solution in different\ncombustion phases of wildfire, as well as how the values of the concentrations\nare influenced by the composition of biomass burning. Specifically, a\ndifferent biomass produces different quantities of the concentrations of these\ngasses. The AQI is influenced by the quantity of each concentration in a non-\nlinear way. If a specific emission\u2019s value succeeds a threshold, the AQI value\nis modified, even if the concentrations of the other emissions are intact.\nSince the gas concentration sensors measure in ppm, conversion between ppm to\n\u03bcg/m^3 must be applied. The mathematical formula for such a conversion [33] is\ngiven below:\n\nwhere is the Threshold Limit Value, P is the pressure of the gas expressed in\nmmHg units, and T is the temperature expressed in \u00b0C units. Under normal\ncircumstances, the value of pressure is 1 atm or 760 mmHg, and the value of\ntemperature is 25 \u00b0C. Since all the experiments are performed under normal\npressure (atmospheric pressure, 760 mmHg), the above expression is\nreformulated to the following:\n\nIt is important to note that not all concentrations of the AQI are important.\nDue to the potential for elevated levels of SO_2 in the center of a crowded\ncity [6], which lead to an inaccurate representation of the air quality in\nthose areas, a decision is made to exclude it from the experimental process.\nFor these experiments, one portable solution is utilized for evaluating the\nmeasuring accuracy of the portable solution. Figure 10 and Figure 11 present\nIndoor experiment values for the emissions\u2019 concentrations and the AQI index,\nrespectively. Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14 demonstrate our outdoor\nexperimental setup and outdoor experiment values for the emissions\u2019\nconcentrations and the AQI index, respectively.\n\nFigure 10. Indoor experiment values for the emissions\u2019 concentrations.\n\nFigure 11. Indoor experiment AQI values.\n\nFigure 12. Outdoor experiment settings.\n\nFigure 13. Outdoor experiment values for the emissions\u2019 concentrations.\n\nFigure 14. Outdoor experiment AQI values.\n\nThe first experiment process is carried out indoors, where room conditions\nprevail. The equipment is placed at a distance of about half a meter from a\nfireplace containing oak logs that are burning, in a position perpendicular to\nthe direction of the smoke. There is no direct contact in this case, and the\nflames are not very intense. The mean temperature is around 28 \u00b0C and the\npressure is normal (1 atm or 760 mmHg). Figure 10 illustrates the observations\nrecorded. The sampling period between each reading is one and a half (1.5)\nseconds. The initial zero values from reading 0 to reading 8 for each\npollutant are due to the fact that when the portable system is activated, it\nis not placed right next to the fire and the smoke. The zero value for the CO\nis due to the fact that the system is perpendicular and at a relative distance\nfrom the smoke. The increasing values of O_3 and NO_2 are due to the\ndisposition of the system. The instant increase in the SO_2 value following a\nquick decrease is due to the fact that this sensor is purposely exposed closer\nto the fire for a short period in order to verify the fact that only at a very\nclose distance are significant changes actually achieved regarding its\nconcentration.\n\nOn the other hand, the second experiment takes place outdoors in a fully\ncontrolled environment taking all the safety measures. The experiment,\ndemonstrated in Figure 12, is conducted on the campus of the University of\nThessaly, Lamia, Greece. Strong winds are not present in the area, and the\nlevel of relative humidity is almost 42%. The fuel used to perform the\nexperiment consists of dry leaves and small branches of plane trees placed\ninside a metal bin. It is worth mentioning that the portable IoT device and\nthe built-in gas sensors are directly exposed to the released smoke, and the\nmonitoring of the concentration values of the pollutants of interest is\ncarried out during the flaming combustion stage. The temperature is around 30\n\u00b0C. Due to the potential for elevated levels of SO_2 in the center of a\ncrowded city [34], which lead to an inaccurate representation of the air\nquality in those areas, we exclude SO_2 concentrations from the second\nexperimental process. This time, when the system is activated, the fire is\nalready burning for an adequate time. The sampling period between each reading\nis again one and a half (1.5) seconds. The initial slope at the beginning is\ndue to smoke being produced at a lower quantity. This can be concluded from\nthe low CO concentration values, in contrast with the rest of the gas\nobservations, and the low values for a long time span, between observations 15\nand 45, where concentrations slowly begin to rise again. Particulate matter\ndecreases slightly earlier but has a spike, possibly due to some dust blown\nfrom the air. Some gaps between the specific values are because the light air\nwas blowing the smoke to a different direction, requiring the system to move\nalongside but, in that time, not facing the smoke. After observation 135, NO_2\nand O_3 values nullify, while the rest of the pollutants nullify after\nobservation 155. This is because, after observation 155, the smoke and fire\nare suppressed, and the system is removed from the source of fire and smoke.\nIt is interesting though, that the two gases nullify significantly earlier.\nThis is probably because the burned biomass evaporates completely, leaving\nonly ash and smoke.\n\nAccordingly, the AQI for the second experiment is illustrated in Figure 14.\nValues 0 to 5 in the y-axis depict step-wise the values of the AQI. \u2018Good\u2019\ncorresponds to 0 and \u2018Extremely Poor\u2019 corresponds to 5. We can obviously\nverify the same result extracted previously. The AQI is constantly high, aside\nfrom values 28 to 40, where the fire has been suppressed, and after\nobservation 155, where the system is removed from the source of fire. The\ndifference between that interval and the concentrations interval is due to the\nspike of the particulate matter. Nevertheless, the overall result verifies\nwhat is resulted from the previous figure.\n\n## 6\\. Conclusions and Future Plans\n\nThe generation of harmful emissions as a consequence of the combustion of\nbiomass necessitates the development of systems that are capable of enhancing\nthe safeguarding of the health and safety of individuals (e.g., firefighters\nand emergency responders) within an affected area. In this paper, we propose\nan integrated system whose main objective is to monitor the air quality of an\narea where a fire incident occurs and seamlessly inform stakeholders in order\nto mitigate detrimental health implications. Adopting a network of IoT\ndevices, portable and stationary, equipped with multiple gas and particle\nsensors, the proposed system manages to monitor the geospatial progression of\nthe pollutants concentrations. These field observations are wirelessly\ndelivered to a remote server which is responsible for performing, adopting the\nmethodology of EAQI, the air quality characterization, and then sharing\nthrough appropriate RESTful APIs and visualizing this inferred information to\ninterested parties. The proposed system could be a module of an integrated\nfire management decision support system.\n\nThe presentation of this solution over the course of a tabletop exercise took\nplace in Evia on 31 October 2023, and received very positive feedback from the\nstakeholders (firefighters, first responders, civil protection authorities,\nand policymakers) who participated. They expressed significant interest in\nportable and stationary IoT devices designed for monitoring the quality of\nambient air and estimating the health impacts on firefighters resulting from\nthe occurrence of fire. It was appreciated that part of the equipment was\nportable, as firefighters could attach it to their trucks and carry it about\nwith ease. Nonetheless, there exist a number of challenges necessitating\nattention to facilitate extensive implementation. Issues such as the number of\ndevices needed, the assurance of hardware security and the appropriate\nstakeholders training have all been identified as areas of concern. Our future\nplans encompass the incorporation of real-time biometric data pertaining to\nthe firefighters and nearby citizens, thereby empowering civil protection\nauthorities to possess a more comprehensive picture of their well-being.\nSubsequently, the improved system will be subjected to experimental assessment\nin real-world situations. The process of evaluating the system in the field\nwould provide us with the capability to not only monitor and record real-time\ndata about pollutant concentrations but also to control various aspects (such\nas energy autonomy and communication assurance) that ensure its optimal\nfunctioning in challenging environmental conditions. An extensive pilot\ntesting plan is underway that includes the adoption of this solution in the\nfield under various fire incident scenarios. Another promising direction is\nthe implementation of machine learning algorithms for the predictive analysis\nof air quality during wildfires. The use of predictive analysis during the\nwildfire provides valuable insight for wider wildfire-monitoring decision\nsupport systems, as well as assisting the guidance of front line wildfire\nfirefighters. Additionally, the incorporation of federated learning could\nprovide a sufficient layer of security and network overhead reduction. In a\nscenario where malicious attackers access the channel and manipulate the\ntransmitted values of the emissions, wildfire firefighters could be misguided\nand potentially harmed. Subsequently, if the learning process is accomplished\nthrough capable enough devices that are nearby with each other, the overhead\nwould be significantly reduced. These advancements have the potential to\nsignificantly improve wildfire management and the protection of wildfire\nfirefighters.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, K.K.; methodology, P.O. and G.B.; software, P.L. and P.O.;\nvalidation, K.K.; formal analysis, K.K.; investigation, P.O. and G.B.;\nresources, P.L.; data curation, K.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation,\nP.L., G.B. and P.O.; writing\u2014review and editing, K.K.; visualization, P.O.;\nsupervision, K.K.; project administration, K.K.; funding acquisition, K.K.
