The shack is home to Diane Mendez and her family\nbut doubles as Alama Yagan, one of nine restaurants in the fishing village of\nPuerto Almanza.\n\nThe village, in Argentinian Tierra del Fuego, has become a foodie haven, and\nthe final stop on the king crab route, a trail that starts in the provincial\ncapital Ushuaia, 45 miles to the east. But things could have been different.\n\nIn 2021, the provincial government voted to ban intensive salmon farming in\nArgentinian waters, after campaigners successfully argued that it would wreak\nenvironmental havoc, close down local fishing fleets and threaten the\nestablished nature-tourism sector, which employs 16,500 people.\n\n\u201cEverything in the sea has benefited from the ban on industrial salmon\nfarming,\u201d says Mendez. \u201cThe whole ecosystem was saved, from the crabs to the\nseaweed; they all depend on a healthy Beagle Channel.\u201d\n\nAlama Yagan, one of nine restaurants in Puerto Almanza, the final stop for\nfoodies enjoying the king crab route. Photograph: Alama Yagan\n\nFor chefs such as Mendez, the sea is her larder. It provides the centolla, or\nking crab, for which the region is famous, as well as mussels, which her\nhusband freedives to collect each day, and huge kelp forests, which she\nharvests to use in her cooking. And it\u2019s all shared with colonies of sea\nlions, rock shags, and the occasional southern right whale passing through.\n\nThe success in Tierra del Fuego led to the formation of the Global Salmon\nFarming Resistance (GSFR), an alliance of environmental organisations and\nscientists that is pushing for others to follow Argentina\u2019s lead. The Falkland\nIslands has also banned the farms, while the Canadian province of British\nColumbia has promised to \u201ctransition away\u201d from salmon farming by 2025. The US\nstate of Washington has also banned them.\n\nBut in neighbouring Chile, the same level of protection does not exist.\n\u201cThings drastically changed over the years with the arrival of this industry,\u201d\nsays Daniel Casado, a film-maker and activist for Centinela Patagonia, a group\nof biologists, engineers, artists and fishers who monitor the marine ecosystem\naround the salmon farms.\n\nAn open-net salmon farm on the Chilean side of the Beagle Channel. Photograph:\nDani Casado\n\nThe first open-net salmon farms arrived in Chilean waters in the 1980s, where\nthe sheltered coastline and cold currents offered perfect conditions. They\nwent unnoticed initially, but now there are an estimated 1,400 dotted among\nthe islands and inlets of the Chilo\u00e9 archipelago.\n\n\u201cThey pretty much destroyed the Chilo\u00e9 area,\u201d says Casado. Now, the industry\nis moving south, threatening some of Chile\u2019s last stretches of pristine\ncoastline. This includes Magallanes, a region he describes as the last\nfrontier before Antarctica, and home to the Kaw\u00e9sqar national park.\n\nThe park has become the new frontline in the battle against salmon farming due\nto a quirk in the law that means only its land, not its waters, are protected.\nYet ironically, the Kaw\u00e9sqar, an Indigenous people who live in the area, are a\nnomadic \u201ccanoe people\u201d, who live on the water, not the land.\n\n> In many areas there is a complete lack of oxygen: nothing can live\n\nDaniel Casado, activist\n\nAs a result of the way the law works, the fjords and channels are becoming a\nnew hub for the salmon industry and Casado fears the continued growth of the\nfarms will devastate local ecosystems and fishing communities.\n\nArtisanal fishing has all but disappeared in Chilo\u00e9, he says, with local laws\npreventing people accessing traditional fishing grounds close to the farms.\nSalmon are also alien to Chilean waters, and the millions that escape each\nyear outcompete indigenous species. There are simply no fish left to catch,\nsays Casado.\n\nBy exceeding stocking limits and placing nets too close together, the farms\nare also affecting water quality, he claims. \u201cDead zones\u201d are appearing\ndirectly beneath the pens \u2013 patches of seabed that are devoid of life due to\nthe buildup of fish faeces and other detritus. \u201cIn many areas there is a\ncomplete lack of oxygen \u2013 nothing can live,\u201d he says.\n\nDead salmon at Porcelana farms in Palena province, southern Chile, in 2021,\nwhen more than 4,200 tonnes of the fish fell victim to killer algae.\nPhotograph: Alvaro Vidal/AFP/Getty\n\nThe charge sheet continues, with activists also placing the blame for huge\nalgal blooms, or \u201cred tides\u201d, on the farms. The algae flourishes in the\nartificially nutrient-rich waters around the pens, and often proves toxic to\nfish, including salmon, and other marine species.\n\n\u201cThe industry says this is natural and not down to them,\u201d says Casado. \u201cBut in\nreality, the eutrophication of the area, by putting so much stuff in the\nwater, causes a big change in the environment.\u201d\n\nThe Chilean government has also begun striking deals with fish farms that have\nbeen set up in national parks illegally by relocating them to new sites, he\nsays.\n\nA salmon leaps for food pellets on a Chilean fish farm. Photograph: STR\nNew/Reuters\n\n\u201cThe government needs to start taking this issue seriously; otherwise\nbusinesses will continue to destroy an area, move on and do it all over again,\nuntil there will be no other place to go,\u201d Casado says.\n\nThe industry disputes the effects it has on the environment. Catarina Martins\nis chief sustainability and technology officer at the Norwegian multinational\nMowi, which is one of the world\u2019s largest salmon-farming businesses and has a\nhuge presence in Chile.\n\nShe believes the likes of the GSFR paint an out-of-date picture of a well-\nregulated industry that operates within strict frameworks. \u201cWe are not the\ncause of these dead zones,\u201d she says.\n\nIt is simply easier to blame the industry for events such as the algal blooms,\nshe argues, rather than considering more complicated causes, such as the\neffects of the climate emergency on ocean dynamics and water temperature.\n\nThe industry is looking at ways to reduce its footprint, says Martins. For\ninstance, introducing fallow periods of between four to six weeks, when no\nfish are farmed, helps to avoid any \u201ccumulative impact\u201d on the seabed, giving\nthe environment time to recover. Skirts around the top of the pens are being\ninstalled to prevent infestations of sea lice, a parasite that can thrive in\nfish farms and decimate the salmon. This has also cut the need for medicated\nfeeds containing antibiotics, which can leach into the environment.\n\nThe Argentinian flag flying in remote Puerto Almanza, Tierra del Fuego.\nPhotograph: Barbara Belen Mendez/Shutterstock\n\nUnderwater lights encourage salmon to feed at different levels, moving them\naround the pens and preventing disease from spreading so easily. Critics,\nhowever, suggest that not enough research has been carried out into their\neffects on other fish and marine mammals.\n\nOutside Alama Yagan, an Argentinian flag flutters in the strong breeze.
