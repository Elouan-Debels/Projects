Offering gateways to other\nworlds requires that these headsets contain entire unseen universes of their\nown. To access them, we\u2019ll need an imaging technology as advanced as these\ndevices: industrial X-ray CT.\n\nWith our Neptune industrial CT scanner and Voyager analysis software, we\nconducted non-destructive teardowns of the Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest Pro,\nand Meta Quest 3 headsets. The point of this exploration is not a head-to-head\ncomparison or product review. Instead, we\u2019re unpacking the way the divergent\ndesign philosophies and market strategies of Apple and Meta reveal themselves\nthrough hardware engineering.\n\n#### Design\n\nIn our CT scans of the Apple Vision Pro, we discover a product that puts\ndesign first. Everything inside the Vision Pro is canted to make the most of\nthe available internal space without detracting from the external contours of\nthe brushed aluminum frame and laminated glass front plate. The main circuit\nboard is built around a flexible PCB ribbon, and electronics are packed in\nhere at different angles.\n\nGive our 3D reconstruction a spin in the Voyager window below. Scroll up and\ndown to zoom in and out.\n\nDespite similarly curved exteriors, both the Quest Pro and newer Quest 3 house\nelements all stacked on a single plane. This traditional main board approach\nis time-tested and effective, especially for off-the-shelf components. In the\nVoyager viewer, click where you see 3D \u25bc to change between the 3D and 2D views\nof the Quest Pro. You can choose between Cardinal X, Y, and Z. Once there, use\nthe slider at the bottom of the viewer to scrub through the selected axis.\n\nInternal layout already offers a key to understanding the design and\nengineering ethos behind these products. Apple\u2019s designers are famous for\ngiving their engineer colleagues tough challenges to deliver on ambitious\nhardware and software performance goals without compromising the overall look\nand feel of a device. Designers define the requirements, and engineers make it\nwork.\n\nThe Meta headsets suggest not so much that the emphasis is reversed, but\nrather that the products have different priorities and target distinct\nmarkets. Apple, at least for now, is going all in for early adopters who are\nready to drop $3,500 for a new kind of computer. Meta, meanwhile, pursues a\ndesign philosophy focused on ease of use and aimed at democratizing virtual\nreality by offering their headset at a more affordable price. At $500, the\nQuest 3 is 1/7th the price of the Vision Pro.\n\n#### Displays\n\nEven though all of these headsets feature video passthrough\u2014a live feed of\nwhat your eyes would see\u2014at the end of the day, none of them are glasses;\nthey\u2019re screens strapped to your face. In the case of the Vision Pro, that\u2019s 2\nmicro-OLED Sony displays. These are screens that, according to Apple, have\n\u201cmore pixels than a 4K TV for each eye.\u201d To be exact, that\u2019s dual 3,680 x\n3,140-pixel, micro-OLED displays. The Quest Pro offers dual LCD panels with\n1800 x 1920 pixels per eye, while the Q3 clocks in at 2,064 x 2,208-pixel\nresolution.\n\n#### Sensors\n\nMeta's Quest devices incorporate handheld controllers complemented by an array\nof SLAM cameras, 3D thumbstick sensors, and action trigger pressure sensors,\nprovide haptic feedback in addition to an intuitive control scheme. An\nexperimental version of hand tracking, driven by inside-out cameras, has been\npart of Meta's OS since 2023.\n\nMeta Quest Touch Pro Controller\n\nThe Vision Pro, on the other hand, leans heavily into eye and hand tracking\nfor UI navigation, utilizing a complex sensor array including eye-tracking IR\ncameras, a LiDAR scanner, the TrueDepth camera system (used for FaceID on\nother Apple devices), downward-facing cameras for hand tracking, and MEMS\nmicrophones for voice commands.\n\nApple Vision Pro\n\nThe Quest 3 features a four-camera setup for spatial tracking and video\npassthrough, a Time of Flight sensor for depth sensing, showcasing a\npreference for infrared light over the more precise but costly LiDAR\ntechnology. Despite the Quest Pro initially planning to include a Time of\nFlight sensor, it was omitted in the final product, highlighting the trade-\noffs in sensor technology selection based on application needs and development\ntimelines.\n\n#### Processors\n\nThe processors in these headsets are the engines of their virtual experiences.\nThe Vision Pro's heart beats with Apple's custom silicon, the M2 and R1 chips,\ndesigned to manage everything from display to spatial computing tasks.\nMeanwhile, the Meta Quest headsets rely on the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2\nplatform.\n\nMeta Quest Pro (left) and Meta Quest 3 (right)\n\n#### Batteries\n\nThe Vision Pro opts for an external battery pack, prioritizing performance\nover onboard power storage. The Quest Pro, with its integrated but uniquely\ncurved battery, strikes a balance between ergonomic design and user\nconvenience. The Quest 3's approach is simpler, placing its battery front and\ncenter on the headset.\n\nApple Vision Pro battery (left), Meta Quest 3 battery (center), Meta Quest Pro\nbattery (right)\n\n#### Thermal management\n\nTo manage the substantial heat generated by their powerful chips, VR headsets\nemploy various cooling strategies. The Quest Pro utilizes a combination of\nactive and passive cooling, featuring a copper heat pipe and two cooling fans.\nThe Quest 3 simplifies with just one fan and omits the heat sink. Apple's\nVision Pro, meanwhile, opts for a compact active cooling solution via micro-\nblowers, ensuring both the chip and display circuit board are kept cool. These\nfans, attached with thermal compound and set against a metal chassis\u2014which\nlikely serves as a passive cooling element\u2014are designed for quiet operation\nand direct heat away from the user, enhancing comfort without compromising\nperformance.\n\nApple Vision Pro micro-blower (left), Meta Quest Pro heat pipe and fans\n(right)\n\n#### Audio systems\n\nImmersive audio is pivotal in crafting virtual experiences that feel as real\nas they look. In the Vision Pro, these are powered by two \"AudioPods\" with a\ndual-driver setup, capable of delivering a surround sound experience tailored\nto the user's head and ear geometry. In the Quests, we see a more minimalist\ninternal view but with the same approach of sound channeled directly into the\nwearer\u2019s ear.\n\nApple Vision Pro AudioPod (left), Meta Quest 3 spatial audio driver (right)\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nMeta\u2019s two headsets demonstrate a striking economy of means.
