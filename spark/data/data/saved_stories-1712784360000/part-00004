The firm hopes to use\nSpaceX\u2019s massive Starship rocket, which is still under development, to launch\nspace megastructures in the future.\n\n\u201cAlmost 20 years ago I designed and built the first two inflatable spacecraft\npressure hulls, and they are still orbiting Earth to this day,\u201d said Max Space\nco-founder Maxim de Jong.\n\n\u201cDespite their success, we realised we couldn\u2019t efficiently scale up to the\nbigger sizes that we really needed in space. So, after both Genesis craft\nflew, I took an entirely different design path to ultimately develop an\nexpandable architecture that is fundamentally predictable and infinitely\nscalable.\u201d\n\nEarly applications for the modules could be as storage depots for space\npropellant, allowing rockets to refuel while in orbit.\n\nMax Space also hopes to secure contracts from Nasa and other government space\nagencies to build an orbiting space station, with the International Space\nStation (ISS) set to retire before 2030.\n\nThe ISS, which was completed in 2011, cost around $100 billion to construct.\nMax Space claims it could build a similar-sized structure for just $200\nmillion \u2013 just 0.2 per cent of the cost.\n\n## Join our commenting forum\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see\ntheir replies\n\nComments\n\n### 1/1Space startup plans to launch \u2018stadium-sized\u2019 habitats\n\n### Space startup plans to launch \u2018stadium-sized\u2019 habitats\n\nA mock-up of Max Space\u2019s expandable habit, which is scheduled to launch aboard\na SpaceX rocket in 2026\n\nMax Space\n\n### Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference\nlater?
