Well, no, not really. But a new research paper has found a correlation\nthat points in that direction: more unemployment, fewer deaths. Underneath\nlies something real, shocking and yet somehow inspiring.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s unpack the research, conducted by economists Amy Finkelstein,\nMatthew Notowidigdo, Frank Schilbach and Jonathan Zhang. They examine the\nimpact of the great recession of 2007-09 on death rates in different parts of\nthe US, some of which suffered sharper increases in unemployment than others.\nThey discover this striking correlation: when the unemployment rate rises by\none percentage point in one of the US\u2019s 741 city regions or \u201ccommuting zones\u201d,\nthe mortality rate in that area falls by 0.5 per cent. This benefit persists\nfor at least a decade, and it is spread evenly across the age distribution\nalthough, in absolute terms, the elderly are most at risk of death and so\nenjoyed the largest benefit.\n\nGiven that the great recession pushed unemployment rates up by nearly five\npercentage points, that suggests that mortality rates were reduced by more\nthan 2 per cent as a result of the financial crisis and subsequent downturn.\nOr, as the researchers put it, \u201cthese estimates imply that The Great Recession\nprovided one in twenty-five 55-year-olds with an extra year of life.\u201d\n\nThese are huge effects. What might explain them? There is no shortage of\ntheories: recessions take people from low-quality, high-stress jobs; by\nfreeing up labour, recessions might improve the quality of care in nursing\nhomes; people who lose their jobs tend to smoke less, eat less fast food and\nhave more time to exercise; recessions may reduce the spread of transmissible\ndiseases.\n\nBut Finkelstein and her co-authors find scant evidence for any of this.\nInstead, they point to air pollution. The air becomes cleaner in areas where\nthe economy slumps. The researchers estimate that this cleaner air accounts\nfor more than one-third of the mortality reduction. This may come as a\nsurprise, because we are not accustomed to regarding air pollution as a\nproblem for rich countries \u2014 the trope is that industrialising cities in Asia\nare smog-ridden, but that for America and Europe the only pollutant that need\nworry us is the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.\n\nThere is some truth in that. As Hannah Ritchie\u2019s book Not the End of the World\ndocuments, local air pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, black\ncarbon and sulphur dioxide have plummeted in the UK after peaking more than 50\nyears ago (they are also beginning to fall in China). Globally, estimated\ndeath rates from air pollution have nearly halved since 1990, according to the\nInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, and they have long been higher in\nmiddle-income countries than rich ones.\n\nEven so, air pollution increases the risk of both respiratory and\ncardiovascular disease, and the global number of deaths caused by air\npollution is estimated by both the World Health Organization and the IHME as\nstill being around seven million people a year, nearly as much as the death\ntoll from smoking. In the US, the death toll from air pollution is often\nestimated to be about 100,000 people a year. These numbers are uncertain, but\nhowever we look at them, they are large.\n\nWhat makes the study by Finkelstein and her colleagues so shocking is that\nthey were not examining the effect of a dramatic shutdown of everyday economic\nactivity because of a lockdown or a natural disaster: this was merely a\nrecession, albeit a severe one. Most people kept their jobs; everyday life\nwould have seemed like business as usual. And yet pollution from sources such\nas traffic fell sufficiently to produce a substantial and lasting drop in the\ndeath rate.\n\nOne response to this discovery is to join the \u201cdegrowth\u201d movement calling for\ncurbs on economic activity. Quite apart from the fact that this is politically\nunthinkable, it would also be unwise. We know that rich countries enjoy\ncleaner air than middle-income countries and we also know \u2014 thanks to the work\nof economists Hannes Schwandt and Till von Wachter \u2014 that while the great\nrecession may have given everyone\u2019s lungs a break, it is likely to do lasting\nharm to the health of young people who graduated into the teeth of that\ndownturn.\n\nBut above all, we know that there are much easier ways to reduce air pollution\nthan a severe recession. Start by replacing some (then most, then all) diesel\ncars with electric cars, some gas stoves with induction hobs and some gas\nboilers with heat pumps. These steps move combustion, and thus pollution, away\nfrom people. Meanwhile, generate the electricity for the new clean appliances\nfrom nuclear or renewable sources, and the pollution is all but eliminated.\n\nBetter technology and smarter regulations can do more for air quality than the\nworst recession you can imagine, and they can do it at low cost, too.\n\nIt may occur that all this is something we might care to do anyway as part of\ndecarbonising the energy system and limiting climate change. Quite so, but it\nseems striking that one can make such a strong case for these clean\ntechnologies without any reference to the greenhouse effect.\n\nAs Chris Goodall explains in his new book Possible: Ways to Net Zero, removing\nfossil fuels from our energy system is technologically feasible, but it is a\ndaunting task requiring huge upgrades to the electricity grid, our storage\ncapacity and much else besides. We should take heart from the fact that these\nsteps to fight climate change will also lead to large and immediate gains in\nour day-to-day health. No great recession is required.\n\nWritten for and first published in the Financial Times on 8 March 2024.\n\nMy first children\u2019s book, The Truth Detective is now available (not US or\nCanada yet \u2013 sorry).\n\nI\u2019ve set up a storefront on Bookshop in the United States and the United\nKingdom.
