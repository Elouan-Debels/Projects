But does the real\nproblem lie elsewhere?\n\nBy Rebecca Mead\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\nCures for the common slump often romanticize an ancestral past as a remedy for\nthe ills of the present.Illustration by Ines Pagniez\n\nListen to this article.\n\nAt the bottom right of my computer screen, just out of my direct line of\nvision, lurks an animated scold: a cartoon giraffe named Rafi. He is the\nplayful icon of an app called Posture Pal, which works in concert with a\nwearer\u2019s AirPods to warn against slumping while sitting at a computer. So long\nas I keep my line of vision trained on this text, Rafi stays discreetly out of\nsight. The minute I rest my chin in my hand in concentration, however\u2014let\nalone sneak a glance at the iPhone that lies tantalizingly close to my\nkeyboard\u2014a baleful Rafi pops up, eyes wide, mouth down-turned. Sit up\nstraight!\n\nRafi is actually less intrusive than the animated animal featured in another\nposture-correction desktop app, Nekoze. This one employs a computer\u2019s camera\nto determine whether the user is slouching or slumping. If she is, an icon of\na cat\u2019s face pops up on her menu bar, accompanied by a surprisingly realistic\nmeow. It\u2019s a peculiar choice for a posture admonition: surely a meow could\nmake a user look down at her ankles for a creature that wants feeding or\npetting, rather than stiffen her spine, eyes front? Then again, nobody would\nvoluntarily install an icon of an angry drill sergeant on a personal computer.\n\nWhat We\u2019re Reading\n\nDiscover notable new fiction and nonfiction.\n\nThe association of animals with posture correction goes beyond an accident of\ndigital cuteness. As Beth Linker explains in her book \u201cSlouch: Posture Panic\nin Modern America\u201d (Princeton), a long history of anxiety about the proximity\nbetween human and bestial nature has played out in this area of social\nscience. Linker, a historian of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania,\nargues that at the onset of the twentieth century the United States became\ngripped by what she characterizes as a poor-posture epidemic: a widespread\nsocial contagion of slumping that could, it was feared, have deleterious\neffects not just upon individual health but also upon the body politic.\nSitting up straight would help remedy all kinds of failings, physical and\nmoral, and Linker traces the history of this concern: from the exchanges of\nnineteenth-century scientists, who first identified the possible ancestral\ncauses of contemporary back pain, to the late-twentieth-century popularity of\nthe Alexander Technique, Pilates, and hatha yoga. The epidemic\u2019s expression\nmay have evolved, but even today it has hardly abated: on Goop, the wellness\nemporium, you can buy a foam roller to combat sitting-induced constriction of\nthe waist and a plastic dome on which to therapeutically rock your pelvis.\nSultry TikTok-ers demonstrate how to strap oneself into a corset-like garment\nthat pins back the shoulders, while buff YouTube influencers explain how to\nappear inches taller by unfurling a tech-bent spine.\n\nLinker makes no claim, she says, about the \u201crealness of the epidemic or the\ndegree to which poor posture is debilitating.\u201d She\u2019s not saying that Rafi and\nthe Nekoze cat are wrong to harry me, or that your lower back doesn\u2019t hurt.\nRather, she sees the \u201cpast and present worries concerning posture as part of\nan enduring concern about so-called \u2018diseases of civilization\u2019 \u201d\u2014grounded in a\nmythology of human ancestry that posits the hunter-gatherer as an ideal from\nwhich we have fallen.\n\nThe origins of posture science date to the latter half of the nineteenth\ncentury, when archeologists and natural scientists were starting to theorize\nthe evolutionary relationship between Homo sapiens and other primates. There\nwas debate as to which came first: upright walking or higher cognition, with\nthe dominant view being that the evolution of the human brain preceded the\ndevelopment of bipedalism. This theory centered a relatively sophisticated\nmind as the defining attribute of our species, and thus was consistent with\nancient hierarchical taxonomies that placed man, with his ability to reason,\napart from and above the beasts. Some scientists wondered whether certain\nphysical problems, like flat feet or scoliosis, were, in effect, the price of\nbraininess. Linker cites the observation of a professor of anatomy at the Art\nInstitute of Chicago: \u201cMan\u2019s original sin consisted in his getting on his hind\nlegs.\u201d\n\nBefore long, there was a societal investment in the betterment of health\nthrough the improvement of posture. Among the most significant popularizers of\nposture science was Jessie Bancroft, who helped found the American Posture\nLeague in 1914. Linker offers a biographical sketch that sounds like the\npremise for an art-house historical drama: Bancroft was \u201ca self-proclaimed\ninvalid who grew up in a remote region of the upper Midwest,\u201d where she came\nunder the tutelage of one Anna Jenness-Miller, \u201can anti-corsetry reformer who\nheld parlor classes on hygiene and recumbent exercises.\u201d Like her mentor,\nBancroft became a lecturer on health culture, eventually moving to New York\nCity, where she served as the first assistant director of physical education\nin the public-school system. There, she introduced a standardized posture test\nthat could be easily carried out by a teacher equipped with little more than a\npole against which a student\u2019s carriage might be compared. Students who failed\nthe assessment\u2014as much as sixty per cent of the public-school population\u2014could\nbe assigned corrective exercises.\n\nCartoon by Seth Fleishman\n\nLink copied\n\nBancroft and her posture peers were influenced by progressive-education\nadvocates, including G. Stanley Hall, William James, and John Dewey, who\nemphasized the importance of play and outdoor activity for children, but did\nnot recommend militaristic drills and synchronized calisthenics, which were\nassociated with Old World European conformity rather than American\nindividualism. On the other hand, the embrace of individualism held its own\npostural perils. Among the bugbears of early posture advocates was the\n\u201cd\u00e9butante slouch,\u201d a fashionable stance associated with less restrictive\ngarments in which the hips jut forward and the shoulders stoop. This way of\nstanding was seen as an embodiment of high-class decadence. (In \u201cThe Great\nGatsby,\u201d the first thing Nick Carraway notices about Jordan Baker is her\nfailure to slouch\u2014she has \u201can erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing\nher body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet\u201d\u2014though her posture is\nthe only thing upright about her; she is also \u201cincurably dishonest.\u201d) The\ndissemination of the d\u00e9butante slouch through displays in department stores\nand drawings in mail-order catalogues\u2014both recent innovations that brought\nmass-produced fashion within reach of the middle class\u2014amounted to a kind of\nsocial contagion in which \u201cthe fashionable slouch threatened to become a\ncommodity in itself, a cost-free way to climb the social ladder.\u201d\n\nIn America at the turn of the twentieth century, anxieties about posture\ninevitably collided with anxieties not just about class but also about race.\nStooping was associated with poverty and with manual, industrialized labor\u2014the\nconditions of working-class immigrants from European countries who, in their\nphysical debasement, were positioned well below the white Anglo-Saxon\nProtestant establishment. Linker argues that, in this environment, \u201cposture\nserved as a marker of social status similar to skin color.\u201d At the same time,\npopulations that had been colonized and enslaved were held up as posture\nparadigms for the \u00e9lite to emulate: the American Posture League rewarded\nsuccessful students with congratulatory pins that featured an image of an\nextremely upright Lenape man. The head-carrying customs associated with\nAfrican women were also adopted as training exercises for white girls of\nprivilege, although Linker notes that Bancroft and her peers recommended that\nyoung ladies learn to balance not baskets and basins, which signified\nfunctionality, but piles of flat, slippery books, markers of their own access\nto leisure and education. For Black Americans, posture was even more fraught:\ndespite the admiration granted to the posture of African women bearing loads\natop their heads, community leaders like Dr. Algernon Jackson, who helped\nestablish the National Negro Health Movement, criticized those Black youth who\n\u201ctoo often slump along, stoop-shouldered and walk with a careless, lazy sort\nof dragging gait.\u201d If slouching among privileged white Americans could\nindicate an enviable carelessness, it was seen as proof of indolence when\nadopted by the disadvantaged.\n\nVideo From The New Yorker\n\nHow Ava DuVernay Restages History in \u201cOrigin\u201d\n\nThis being America, posture panic was swiftly commercialized, with a range of\nproducts marketed to appeal to the eighty per cent of the population whose\ncarriage had been deemed inadequate by posture surveys. The footwear industry\ndrafted orthopedic surgeons to consult on the design of shoes that would\nlessen foot and back pain without the stigma of corrective footwear: one\nbrand, Trupedic, advertised itself as \u201ca real anatomical shoe without the\nfreak-show look.\u201d The indefatigable Jessie Bancroft trained her sights on\nchildren\u2019s clothing, endorsing a company that created a \u201cRight-Posture\u201d\njacket, whose trim cut across the upper shoulders gave its schoolboy wearer\nlittle choice but to throw his shoulders back like Jordan Baker. Bancroft\u2019s\nAmerican Posture League endorsed girdles and corsets for women; similar\ngarments were also adopted by men, who, by the early nineteen-fifties, were\npurchasing abdominal \u201cbracers\u201d by the millions.\n\nIt was in this era that what eventually proved to be the most contentious form\nof posture policing reached its height, when students entering college were\nrequired to submit to mandatory posture examinations, including the taking of\nnude or semi-nude photographs. For decades, incoming students had been\nevaluated for conditions such as scoliosis by means of a medical exam, which\ncame to incorporate photography to create a visual record. Linker writes that\nfor many male students, particularly those who had military training,\nundressing for the camera was no biggie. For female students, it was often a\nmore disquieting undertaking. Sylvia Plath, who endured it in 1950, drew upon\nthe experience in \u201cThe Bell Jar,\u201d whose protagonist, Esther Greenwood,\ndiscovers that undressing for her boyfriend is as uncomfortably exposing as\n\u201cknowing . . . that a picture of you stark naked, both full view and side\nview, is going into the college gym files.\u201d The practice of taking posture\nphotographs was gradually abandoned by colleges, thanks in part to the rise of\nthe women\u2019s movement, which gave coeds a new language with which to express\ntheir discomfort. It might have been largely forgotten were it not for a 1995\narticle in the Times Magazine, which raised the alarming possibility that\nthere still existed stashes of nude photographs of famous former students of\nthe Ivy League and the Seven Sisters, such as George H. W. Bush, Bob Woodward,\nMeryl Streep, and Hillary Clinton. Many of the photographs in question were\ntaken and held not by the institutions themselves but by the mid-century\npsychologist William Herbert Sheldon. Sheldon was best known for his later\ndiscredited theories of somatotypes, whereby he attributed personality\ncharacteristics to individuals based on whether their build was ectomorphic,\nendomorphic, or mesomorphic.\n\nBy the time the Times article was published, Sheldon was dead, and his\ntheories, which were found to have been shot through with racial stereotyping,\nwere buried. Many thousands of his photographs of Ivy League students remained\nin the National Anthropological Archives, at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum\nof Natural History, and, as the article observed, the danger of their ever\nbeing released, or even the mere fact of their existence, conferred \u201con some\nof the most overprivileged people in the world the one status distinction it\nseemed they\u2019d forever be denied\u2014victim.\u201d The scandal prompted the archivists\nto shred thousands of Sheldon\u2019s images that had been held in the institution\u2019s\nown secure storerooms, in order to placate exactly the kind of high-status\nindividuals who are used to getting their way. The result was the destruction\nof a large-scale historical record that might have been of incalculable use to\ncurrent and future researchers. (Linker cites as a parallel the Framingham\nHeart Study, which has been recording the cardiovascular health of residents\nof Framingham, Massachusetts, since 1948.) As it turned out, the hasty bonfire\nof the nudities did not, in fact, consume all the images retained in the\nSheldon archive, providing Linker\u2019s story with a nasty sting in the tail:\nSheldon had also made photographs at institutions such as the Oregon State\nPrison and the New York State Hospitals system, and those images, according to\nLinker, are still listed in the catalogue as intact.\n\nLinker draws attention to an academic research project that was carried out in\nthe nineteen-seventies. Gretchen Dieck, then a doctoral student at Yale, set\nout to use postural images taken at Smith College, cross-referenced with\npresent-day self-reports by alumnae, to see whether the presence of spinal\ncurvature in a teen-age girl predicted back pain in later life. Although, in\nLinker\u2019s telling, Dieck went to scrupulous lengths to protect the subjects\u2019\nanonymity, former Smith students were distressed to discover that the school\nstill held the photographs, and it was ultimately obliged to destroy them.\nBefore it did, though, Dieck was able to determine that, contrary to the\ndecades-long drumbeat of the posture-correction establishment, a diagnosis of\npoor posture in youth didn\u2019t correlate strongly with future back pain; even\nscoliosis, which at the time was aggressively treated with metal braces, and\nsometimes with steel-rod implants, played a \u201crelatively unimportant role in\nthe development of spinal pain in the adult years.\u201d The findings brought into\nquestion all the allegedly predictive surveillance of posture, not to mention\nall the devices and treatments sold to Americans with the promise of averting\nfuture pain.\n\nLinker is scathing about the way in which additional research to confirm or\ndevelop such findings has been foreclosed by the photographs\u2019 destruction. The\nresult, she worries, is that the dubious narrative that slouching is bad for\nyou has hardened even further into conventional wisdom, stigmatizing bodies\nthat may be less than perfectly upright but are nonetheless pain-free, in \u201ca\ntype of therapeutic reasoning that essentially makes the risk of disease or\ndisability acquisition a disease state itself.\u201d\n\nToday, the descendants of Jessie Bancroft are figures like Esther Gokhale, a\nBay Area acupuncturist and the creator of the Gokhale Method, who teaches\n\u201cprimal posture\u201d courses to tech executives and whose recommendations are\nconsonant with other fitness trends, such as barefoot running and \u201cpaleo\u201d\neating, that romanticize an ancestral past as a remedy for the ills of the\npresent. The compulsory mass surveillance that ended when universities ceased\nthe practice of posture photography has been replaced by voluntary individual\nsurveillance, with the likes of Rafi the giraffe and the Nekoze cat monitoring\na user\u2019s vulnerability to \u201ctech neck,\u201d a newly named complaint brought on by\nexcessive use of the kind of devices profitably developed by those paleo-\neating, barefoot-running, yoga-practicing executives. Meanwhile, Linker\nreports, paleoanthropologists quietly working in places other than TikTok have\nbegun to revise the popular idea that our ancient ancestors did not get aches\nand pains in their backs. Analysis of fossilized spines has revealed\ndegenerative changes suggesting that \u201cthe first upright hominids to roam the\nearth likely experienced back pain, or would have been predisposed to such a\ncondition if they had lived long enough.\u201d Slouching, far from being a disease\nof civilization, then, seems to be something we\u2019ve been prone to for as long\nas we have stood on our own two feet. \u2666\n\nPublished in the print edition of the April 15, 2024, issue, with the headline\n\u201cScared Straight.\u201d\n\n## New Yorker Favorites\n\n  * Why facts don\u2019t change our minds.\n\n  * The tricks rich people use to avoid taxes.\n\n  * The man who spent forty-two years at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.\n\n  * How did polyamory get so popular?\n\n  * The ghostwriter who regrets working for Donald Trump.\n\n  * Snoozers are, in fact, losers.\n\n  * Fiction by Jamaica Kincaid: \u201cGirl\u201d\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New\nYorker.\n\nRebecca Mead is a staff writer at The New Yorker.
