Also known as the \u201cTikTok\nbill\u201d, this legislation demands that TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, ByteDance, sell\nthe video-sharing platform to a non-Chinese buyer. Failure to do so will\nresult in it being banned in the US.\n\nDespite overwhelming bipartisan support in the House (and from President\nBiden), it remains highly uncertain whether the legislation will pass the\nSenate.\n\nIt may also face legal challenges on constitutional grounds from civil rights\ngroups concerned that it violates the First Amendment\u2019s free speech\nprovisions. Whether such challenges have any legal merit, however, is\ndebatable. Although framed as such by TikTok, the bill isn\u2019t intended to ban\non TikTok \u2014 its primary aim is instead to force a sale from the Chinese\nByteDance to a US firm (or at least one unconnected to Beijing).\n\nA ban will only be implemented if TikTok doesn\u2019t find a suitable buyer. As\ncontext for this, the US also doesn\u2019t allow foreign ownership of broadcast\ncompanies and has recently forced divestment of other Chinese companies on\nnational security grounds (for example, Grindr).\n\nWhatever the outcome, the bill highlights widespread concern over whether it\u2019s\nsafe to use TikTok.\n\n## What is TikTok?\n\nTikTok is a social media platform known for its short-form video content.\nUsers can create, share, and discover videos ranging from a few seconds to\nseveral minutes in length. Launched internationally in 2017 by ByteDance,\nTikTok has rapidly become one of the world\u2019s most popular apps, especially\namong younger audiences. It\u2019s currently estimated to have over 1.7 billion\nusers worldwide.\n\nIts algorithm is designed to personalize the user experience, offering a feed\nof videos curated to each user\u2019s preferences, which has contributed\nsignificantly to the app\u2019s addictive quality and global reach.\n\nTikTok also includes a community aspect, where users can follow, like, comment\non, and share videos from others, fostering a vibrant and interactive online\ncommunity. The platform has been wildly influential, shaping internet culture,\nlaunching viral trends, and even propelling songs and artists to fame.\n\n## What are the security risks with TikTok?\n\nMost concerns around TikTok focus on the fact that as a Chinese company,\nByteDance is required to share any data deemed relevant to Chinese national\nsecurity with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) upon request.\n\nThese fears have been exacerbated by some frankly shocking admissions and\naccusations regarding the platform, which include:\n\n### TikTok spied on journalists\n\nTikTok has admitted that it used its app to spy on reporters in an effort to\ntrack internal leaks. To achieve this, it improperly accessed their IP\naddresses and user data in an attempt to identify whether they had been in the\nsame locales as ByteDance employees suspected of leaking information.\n\n### TikTok was used to spy on Hong Kong activists\n\nA former senior ByteDance executive has accused TikTok of helping the CCP to\nspy on Hong Kong pro-democracy activists. In a US court filing, Yintao Yu said\nthat TikTok helped identify and monitor \u201cprotest-related content\u201d, which it\nthen handed over to the Chinese authorities.\n\n### TikTok ran keylogging code in its app\n\nA privacy researcher and former Google engineer claims that he found malicious\ncode running inside TikTok\u2019s in-app browser that could monitor keystrokes.\nThis would allow TikTok to log users\u2019 credit card details and other sensitive\ninformation inputted into the browser window.\n\n## Other safety concerns about TikTok\n\n### Extensive tracking and corporate surveillance\n\nTikTok is undoubtedly at least as invasive to your privacy as any other big\nsocial media platform, such as Facebook, X, or Instagram. This means it\ncollects and shares a wealth of information about you, including:\n\n  * Your IP address\n  * Your device\u2019s International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number\n  * GPS location data\n  * How you engage with videos and other content on the platform, such as which videos you watch, how long you watch them for, and which videos you download\n\nTikTok has also been accused of particularly aggressive pixel tracking, a form\nof fingerprinting that uses invisible code, to uniquely identify internet\nusers and track their browsing histories even when they don\u2019t themselves use\nTikTok.\n\nIt uses the information it collects in the following ways:\n\n  * To target you with ever more personalized ads\n  * To share with its business partners (primarily so they can also target you with personalized ads)\n\nLearn more about how TikTok abuses your privacy\n\n### TikTok scams\n\nTikTok users have been targeted with numerous scams. Some of the best-\ndocumented scams include:\n\n  * Pyramid and Ponzi \u201cget rich quick\u201d schemes\n  * Romance scams\n  * Mobile game scams (notably around Roblox)\n  * Job scams\n\n## But is TikTok really that unsafe?\n\nYes. TikTok undoubtedly collects far more information than it needs and has\nunclear data privacy protections from its host nation\u2019s government. If you\u2019re\nconcerned about maintaining your privacy and minimizing how much personal\ninformation you expose, you should delete it immediately. If your security\nmodel involves trying to shield your information from the Chinese government,\nwe advise you avoid TikTok entirely.\n\nLearn how to delete TikTok and clear your data\n\nHowever, the same is also true of Facebook, Instagram, X, Snapchat, and all of\nGoogle\u2019s services. These services harvest a huge amount of personal data and,\nas Edward Snowden\u2019s mass surveillance revelations exposed, share this with the\nUS government.\n\nThe US government can also issue national security letters (NSLs), compelling\ncompanies to turn over vast amounts of personal data and metadata without any\njudicial oversight. These are usually accompanied by a gag order that prevents\nthe company from alerting their users that they\u2019ve served with an NSL.\n\nThe US government may also have shifted to simply buying US citizens\u2019 internet\ndata from commercial data brokers rather than relying on the direct\ncooperation of social media companies (although it still does this), but the\nunderlying reality has hardly changed \u2014 the US government continues to spy on\nUS citizens\u2019 internet activities.\n\nLearn more about why the US is not good for privacy\n\nThe US has made at least some progress at reining in the more egregious abuses\nby domestic social media companies themselves, but it remains questionable\nwhether the way in which TikTok collects and abuses your data for financial\ngain is fundamentally any different from how other commercial social media\nplatforms behave. TikTok is also not unusual in hosting scams.\n\nHowever, as recent news that the US and UK are imposing sanctions on China\nfollowing accusations it sponsored a years-long cyber-attack campaign\ntargeting politicians, journalists, and businesses clearly demonstrates, the\nthreat from China is very real.\n\nAnd as we\u2019ve seen from the way in which TikTok can spy on journalists and\nactivists, spread misinformation, and even potentially log its users\u2019\nkeystrokes, concerns that the wildly popular social media platform is a\npotentially highly dangerous tool while in Chinese hands are also justified.\n\n## How to use TikTok (more) safely\n\nThere is no safe way to use TikTok. As the incident where TikTok spied on\njournalists\u2019 IP addresses demonstrates, even having TikTok installed on your\nphone is a serious danger to your privacy and security. If you really care\nabout being safe and private online, you should just delete TikTok.\n\nThis is especially true if you are a journalist, activist, politician,\ngovernment official, or have access to any confidential information\nwhatsoever.\n\n## Is TikTok safe? Our verdict\n\nNo. TikTok abuses your privacy, has pushed extremist content, and may well\nrepresent a serious national security risk to citizens of other countries.\nThere is no safe way to use TikTok, and our strong recommendation is to delete\nthe app from all your devices.\n\nIt\u2019s true that much of the current furor over TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership comes\nfrom wider geopolitical concerns, rather than the problems with the app\nitself. It\u2019s also true that US-based social media giants such as Facebook and\nX also abuse your privacy in similar ways and share data (directly or\nindirectly) with the US government, and aren\u2019t receiving the kind of scrutiny\nthat TikTok is now undergoing.\n\nBut there\u2019s also little doubt that China genuinely is a threat, not just US-\nnational security, but to the national security of many nations, and that\nTikTok could be a highly dangerous weapon in its cyber-arsenal.\n\n#### Douglas Crawford\n\nStarting with ProPrivacy and now Proton, Douglas has worked for many years as\na technology writer.
