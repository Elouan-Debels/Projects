Image: Jules Roscoe\n\nA photo of a cashier Zooming into work at a fried chicken shop in New York\nCity from the Philippines went viral on X this weekend. The cashier sits on a\ncomputer monitor on top of an empty cashier desk and a virtual background of\nthe store\u2019s logo. Brett Goldstein, who posted the photo, wrote that this was\n\u201cinsane\u201d and said it \u201conly takes a short hop to imagine the near future where\nthis is an AI avatar.\u201d\n\nThe Zoom cashier is real. She works at Sansan Chicken, a small Japanese fried\nchicken shop nestled next to New York University\u2019s campus in the East Village.\nThe store has a touchscreen ordering kiosk similar to those that are common at\nMcDonald\u2019s. But it also has a separate setup with the Zoom worker, who also\ntakes orders from customers.\n\nThe iPad that would normally serve as a payment terminal reads \u201cWELCOME TO MY\nSTORE\u201d in Comic Sans. When the cashier leaves to take a break, she switches\nher background to say \u201cThe cashier will be back :).\u201d On a piece of paper,\ntaped to the cash register and facing customers, is the handwritten Zoom\nmeeting ID and password, presumably so a human employee at the restaurant can\ndial in the remote worker.\n\nThe cashier desk. Image: Jules Roscoe\n\n\u201cAn everyday experience you\u2019d think would have to be in person\u2014to have that\nmediated through a screen is pretty weird,\u201d Alex Tey, an NYU student who\nvisited the shop a couple months ago told 404 Media. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to ask of\nyour customers, I think. It\u2019s even a little alienating.\u201d\n\nTey said that when she had been last, there was both an in-person and a Zoom\ncashier. After she ordered, Tey went to speak to the physical cashier, who\ndirected her to speak to the virtual one instead.\n\n\u201cThey were both human, but the person who rang up my owner was on a screen, so\nit didn\u2019t feel like I was talking to a person,\u201d Tey said. \u201cThe choppy part was\ntalking to somebody with lag. Checking out in person with lag is not something\nthat we\u2019re used to.\u201d\n\nInside Sansan Chicken East Village. Image: Jules Roscoe\n\nWhen I walked into the store Monday, the cashier (who was a different woman\nthan in Goldstein\u2019s photo) greeted me by saying, \u201cHi, welcome to Sansan\nChicken!\u201d Her voice was slightly laggy and emanated from an Insignia speaker\nsitting on the desk, next to two fake plants. She greeted everybody who walked\nthrough the door like this, though nobody seemed to be paying much attention\nto her. When one man was taken aback by being greeted by a computer screen,\nshe offered to take his order.\n\nIn the red and white wall behind the ordering kiosk, there is a 2-foot-wide\nrectangular window, through which the two or three in-person staff members\npass orders from the kitchen. I asked a few questions through this window.\n\nThe ordering kiosk and kitchen window. Image: Jules Roscoe\n\n\u201cWhen you do the business, you want to control the cost,\u201d a manager who did\nnot give her name told me through the window. \u201cIn New York City, the regular\nincome is very high, so you don\u2019t want to pay attention to think about this\nkind of question,\u201d she continued, gesturing toward the cashier as if to\nindicate that she did not want to have to worry about another employee. \u201cAs a\nbusiness owner, you\u2019ve got to think about this. It\u2019s very useful.\u201d\n\nShe said that the cashiers work through a different company based in the\nPhilippines, which has a 12-hour time difference to New York, and usually\nchange shifts at around 3 p.m. The cashier confirmed that she was in the\nPhilippines, where she said that it was 1:11 a.m.\n\nWhen I asked what company she worked for, she said that she was sorry, but\ncould not answer any more questions. Goldstein wrote in his X thread that the\ncompany in question was called \u201cHappy Cashier\u201d and that they had no website,\nthough they were operating in five Asian food stores throughout the city. 404\nMedia was unable to verify which company the remote worker actually worked\nfor, and could find no job listings or information for \u201cHappy Cashier\u201d on the\ninternet. The setup at Sansan Chicken appears to be more or less a DIY remote\nwork solution, because they are literally using Zoom, a webcam, and a separate\npair of speakers for the job.\n\n\ud83c\udfe2\n\nDo you know anything else about automated worker systems? I would love to hear\nfrom you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +1\n508 241 7705. Otherwise, send me an email at jules@404media.co.\n\nSansan Chicken also has a location in Long Island City, though it is unclear\nwhether this store has a Zoom cashier.\n\n\u201cIt totally makes sense to me if this is some dumb start-up outsourcing\ncashier labor, which is already underpaid, to the Global South for cheap,\u201d Tey\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s usually invisible to Western consumers, but this\ntime it\u2019s visible. They\u2019re not even claiming it\u2019s an AI or algorithm before\noutsourcing it to the Philippines.\u201d\n\nOutsourcing work to the Global South has been a recent topic of discussion\nafter Amazon shuttered its famous Just Walk Out checkout system at Amazon\nFresh stores last week, which relied on remote workers in India to train its\nAI systems and to do manual troubleshooting if anything went wrong.\n\nSansan did not respond to requests for comment through their website or\nthrough an Instagram DM. However, on Monday afternoon the restaurant shared a\npost by New York City meme page @newyorkers to their Instagram story of\nGoldstein\u2019s original photo, with the caption \u201cThanks for the repost.\u201d\n\nTey told 404 Media that the chicken she ate was \u201cokay.\u201d\n\nBecome a paid subscriber for unlimited, ad-free articles and access to bonus\ncontent.
