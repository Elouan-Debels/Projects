Raimondo\nnamed Paul Christiano as Head of AI Safety, Adam Russell as Chief Vision\nOfficer, Mara Campbell as Acting Chief Operating Officer and Chief of Staff,\nRob Reich as Senior Advisor, and Mark Latonero as Head of International\nEngagement. They will join AISI Director Elizabeth Kelly and Chief Technology\nOfficer Elham Tabassi, who were announced in February. The AISI was\nestablished within NIST at the direction of President Biden, including to\nsupport the responsibilities assigned to the Department of Commerce under the\nPresident\u2019s landmark Executive Order.\n\n\u201cTo safeguard our global leadership on responsible AI and ensure we\u2019re\nequipped to fulfill our mission to mitigate the risks of AI and harness its\nbenefits, we need the top talent our nation has to offer. That is precisely\nwhy we\u2019ve selected these individuals, who are the best in their fields, to\njoin the U.S. AI Safety Institute executive leadership team,\u201d said U.S.\nSecretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. \u201cDeveloping guidelines that will\nstrengthen our safety and security, engaging with civil society and business,\nand working in lockstep with our allies are fundamental to addressing this\ngeneration-defining technology. Because of President Biden\u2019s leadership, we\u2019re\ncultivating the talent pool necessary to achieve these critical goals.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the direction of President Joe Biden, the United States Government is\nmoving fast and using every tool at our disposal to seize the promise of AI\nwhile managing the risks,\u201d said Bruce Reed, White House Deputy Chief of Staff.\n\u201cOne of the best levers we have to get this right is to bring in the experts\nfrom civil society to tech innovators to scientists. We are building a strong\nteam across government to keep pace with this technology, protect our\ninterests, and shape it in accordance with our values.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very pleased to welcome these talented experts to the U.S. AI Safety\nInstitute leadership team to help establish the measurement science that will\nsupport the development of AI that is safe and trustworthy,\u201d said Under\nSecretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST Director Laurie E.\nLocascio. \u201cThey each bring unique experiences that will help the institute\nbuild a solid foundation for AI safety going into the future.\u201d\n\nPaul Christiano, Head of AI Safety, will design and conduct tests of frontier\nAI models, focusing on model evaluations for capabilities of national security\nconcern. Christiano will also contribute guidance on conducting these\nevaluations, as well as on the implementation of risk mitigations to enhance\nfrontier model safety and security. Christiano founded the Alignment Research\nCenter, a non-profit research organization that seeks to align future machine\nlearning systems with human interests by furthering theoretical research. He\nalso launched a leading initiative to conduct third-party evaluations of\nfrontier models, now housed at Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR). He\npreviously ran the language model alignment team at OpenAI, where he pioneered\nwork on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a foundational\ntechnical AI safety technique. He holds a PhD in computer science from the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, and a B.S. in mathematics from the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nMara Quintero Campbell, Acting Chief Operating Officer and Chief of Staff,\nwill be responsible for staff and decision-making coordination and design,\nexecution, and oversight of the AISI operations and activities.
