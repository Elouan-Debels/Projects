The Post\u2019s\nTech Friend columnist Shira Ovide called it \u201cvisible proof that government\nwebsites don\u2019t have to stink.\u201d Online, people tweeted praise after filing\ntheir taxes, like the user who called it the \u201ceasiest tax experience of my\nlife.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the users might be a happy group, however, there weren\u2019t many of them\ncompared to other tax filing options \u2014 and their positive reviews likely won\u2019t\nbudge the opposition that Direct File has faced from tax software companies\nand Republicans from the outset. These headwinds will likely continue if the\nIRS wants to renew it for another tax season.\n\nThe program opened to the public midway through tax season, when many low-\nincome filers had already claimed their refunds \u2014 and was restricted to\ntaxpayers in 12 states, with only four types of income (wages, interest,\nSocial Security and unemployment). But it gained popularity as tax season went\non: The Treasury Department said more than half of the total users of Direct\nFile completed their returns during the last week.\n\n###\n\nIndustry pushback\n\nCommercial software companies are continuing to blast Direct File as unpopular\nand unnecessary \u2014 pointing out that its user pool is still dwarfed by those\nusing other options.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a real demand there for this,\u201d said David Ransom, a lawyer for\nsoftware industry group American Coalition for Taxpayer Rights. \u201cThere\u2019s a\npolitical push to try to create a demand that apparently does not exist.\u201d\n\nThe IRS has been criticized from within the government as well, with the\nGovernment Accountability Office issuing a report last week that faulted the\nagency for failing to fully document how much it cost to build the Direct File\nsite.\n\nWhether the software gets a second year, former IRS commissioner Mark Everson\npredicted, \u201cdepends 100 percent on who the treasury secretary is come\nJanuary.\u201d\n\nA second-term Biden administration would likely run Direct File again, perhaps\neven expanding the parameters the software can handle and offering it in more\nstates. If former president Donald Trump wins the election, on the other hand,\nits prospects are less secure. While Trump\u2019s own views on Direct File are not\nknown (his campaign declined to respond to questions), Republicans at the\nnational and state levels have been critical of government-run tax filing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut some proponents argue that Direct File might live on, even under a\npresident who didn\u2019t support it, since the IRS has wide discretion in how to\nspend its own budget.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they built it to shut it down,\u201d said Adam Ruben, whose\norganization, the Economic Security Project, has been promoting the website to\ntaxpayers. \u201cI\u2019ll be surprised if we don\u2019t see it expand to more states and\nmore tax situations next year.\u201d\n\nDavid Kautter, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax policy,\nsaid the IRS won\u2019t equate user numbers with success or failure.\n\n\u201cThe IRS would say ... we didn\u2019t set our sights real high. We tried to make\nthis a controlled pilot program,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the IRS can develop a user-\nfriendly interface, then it has the possibility to become very popular\u201d in the\nfuture.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOne unexpected twist was that publicity around Direct File drew attention to\nother long-standing government-supported options. The Free File Alliance, a\ngroup of private companies that offer free versions of their software to\neligible taxpayers, said that as of April 5, more than 1.7 million households\nhad used Free File software, an increase of 16 percent compared to the same\ntime last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, IRS-supported Volunteer Income Tax Assistance programs had prepared\n2.3 million free returns, an increase of 200,000 compared to last year,\nTreasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen told reporters on a call Friday.\n\nThe IRS has also touted its hiring of more than 5,000 customer service workers\nsince receiving tens of billions of dollars of additional funding from\nCongress in 2022. This year, its workers answered more than 85 percent of\nphone calls from taxpayers, compared to 15 percent before the new funding, the\nIRS said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOverall, it was \u201cone of the best tax filing seasons the nation has seen in\nyears,\u201d said IRS commissioner Danny Werfel on the call Friday.\n\n###\n\nHits and misses\n\nFour taxpayers agreed to let a Washington Post reporter observe while they\ntried using Direct File.\n\nIn California, Tristan Brown, a state teachers union lobbyist, spent 15\nminutes filling in his information before realizing that he had received a\n$140 dividend, a form of income that Direct File wouldn\u2019t allow him to report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m stuck. Which is lame. I feel like a lot of people are going to\nhave [an investment] account that would have that,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019m back to\nletting TurboTax take my money.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMia Francis, a barista, ran into similar trouble. Eight minutes in, she\nlearned the site wouldn\u2019t allow her to file since she had lived and earned\nincome during the year in a nonparticipating state before moving to\nMassachusetts. \u201cI do a lot of moving around. Unless they have it where ... you\ncan use it if you lived in more than one state, it will be unlikely that I\u2019ll\nbe able to do it,\u201d she said as she stared at the screen.\n\nBut two of the taxpayers made it all the way through.\n\nHavilah Fowler, an 18-year-old barista, was nervous about filing her first-\never tax return. The identity verification process was cumbersome and took her\nmore than an hour, including a wait for a video call. Then she read and reread\nsome of the prompts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nShe wasn\u2019t sure, for example, what \u201cstandard deduction\u201d meant. \u201cWhat is going\non? Google will explain this better,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, when she got to the final page and saw her refund was on its way, she\ncheered and clapped.\n\nDescribing herself as \u201can inexperienced taxpayer,\u201d Natalie Comerford, 20,\nclicked several times when the site offered buttons to explain or clarify tax\nconcepts. She read explanations about how to correctly type in information\nfrom her W-2s from her part-time jobs, what \u201cestimated tax payments\u201d are, and\nwhether she was entitled to any tax credits. Less than an hour after she\nbegan, she submitted her return.\n\n\u201cNormally government sites are really clunky,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was really\neasy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nD.C. region\n\nLocal news, weather, sports, events, restaurants and more\n\nSix-run sixth inning dooms the Nationals to a series loss in Oakland\n\nWith a playoff spot near, the Caps know \u2018everything matters right now\u2019\n\nIn another must-win game, the Capitals prevail for injured Nick Jensen\n\nback\n\nTry a different topic\n\nSign in or create a free account to save your preferences\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompany\n\n* About The Post\n* Newsroom Policies & Standards\n* Diversity & Inclusion\n* Careers\n* Media & Community Relations\n* WP Creative Group\n* Accessibility Statement\n* Sitemap\n\nGet The Post\n\n* Become a Subscriber\n* Gift Subscriptions\n* Mobile & Apps\n* Newsletters & Alerts\n* Washington Post Live\n* Reprints & Permissions\n* Post Store\n* Books & E-Books\n* Print Archives (Subscribers Only)\n* Today\u2019s Paper\n* Public Notices\n* Coupons\n\nContact Us\n\n* Contact the Newsroom\n* Contact Customer Care\n* Contact the Opinions Team\n* Advertise\n* Licensing & Syndication\n* Request a Correction\n* Send a News Tip\n* Report a Vulnerability\n\nTerms of Use\n\n* Digital Products Terms of Sale\n* Print Products Terms of Sale\n* Terms of Service\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Settings\n* Submissions & Discussion Policy\n* RSS Terms of Service\n* Ad Choices\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n  * About The Post\n  * Contact the Newsroom\n  * Contact Customer Care\n  * Request a Correction\n  * Send a News Tip\n  * Report a Vulnerability\n  * Download the Washington Post App\n  * Policies & Standards\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Print Products Terms of Sale\n  * Digital Products Terms of Sale\n  * Submissions & Discussion Policy\n  * RSS Terms of Service\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Coupons\n\n", "frontpage": true}
