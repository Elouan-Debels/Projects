For the\nhedonist, constant pleasure-seeking may not yield the most actual pleasure or\nhappiness in the long term, when consciously pursuing pleasure interferes with\nexperiencing it.\n\nThe utilitarian philosopher Henry Sidgwick was first to note in The Methods of\nEthics that the paradox of hedonism is that pleasure cannot be acquired\ndirectly.^[1] Variations on this theme appear in the realms of philosophy,\npsychology, and economics.\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\nPart of a series on  \n---  \nHedonism  \nThinkers\n\n  * Ajita Kesakambali\n  * Jeremy Bentham\n  * John Stuart Mill\n  * Julien Offray de La Mettrie\n  * Aristippus\n  * Epicurus\n  * Fred Feldman\n  * Theodorus the Atheist\n  * Michel Onfray\n  * Aristippus the Younger\n  * Hermarchus\n  * Lucretius\n  * Pierre Gassendi\n  * Metrodorus of Lampsacus\n  * David Pearce\n  * Zeno of Sidon\n  * Yang Zhu\n  * Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6\n  * Esperanza Guis\u00e1n\n  * Peter Singer\n\n  \nSchools of hedonism\n\n  * Psychological hedonism\n  * Ethical hedonism\n  * Axiological hedonism\n  * Charvaka\n  * Cyrenaics\n  * Epicureanism\n  * Christian hedonism\n  * Utilitarianism\n  * Yangism\n  * Libertinage\n\n  \nKey concepts\n\n  * Aponia\n  * Ataraxia\n  * Eudaimonia\n  * Happiness\n  * Hedone\n  * Pain\n  * Pleasure\n  * Sensation\n  * Suffering\n  * Tetrapharmakos\n  * Felicific calculus\n\n  \nRelated articles\n\n  * Paradox of hedonism\n  * Hedonic treadmill\n  * \"Wine, women and song\"\n  * Joie de vivre\n\n  \n  \n  * v\n  * t\n  * e\n\n  \n  \nFailing to attain pleasures while deliberately seeking them has been variously\ndescribed:\n\n  * John Stuart Mill, the utilitarian philosopher, in his autobiography:\n\n> But I now thought that this end [one's happiness] was only to be attained by\n> not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have\n> their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness[....] Aiming\n> thus at something else, they find happiness along the way[....] Ask yourself\n> whether you are happy, and you cease to be so.^[2]\n\n  * Viktor Frankl in Man's Search for Meaning:\n\n> Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the\n> unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than\n> oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than\n> oneself.\n\n> The more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her\n> ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. Pleasure\n> is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and\n> spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.^[3]\n\n  * Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in The Antichrist (1895) and The Will to Power (1901):\n\n> What is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the\n> will to power, power itself.\n>\n> What is bad? Everything that is born of weakness.\n>\n> What is happiness? The feeling that power increases\u2014that a resistance is\n> overcome.^[4]\n\n> [...] it is significantly enlightening to substitute for the individual\n> 'happiness' (for which every living being is supposed to strive) power [...]\n> joy is only a symptom of the feeling of attained power [...] (one does not\n> strive for joy [...] joy accompanies; joy does not move)^[5]\n\n  * Psychologist Alfred Adler in The Neurotic Constitution (1912):\n\n> Nietzsche's \"will to power\" and \"will to seem\" embrace many of our views,\n> which again resemble in some respects the views of F\u00e9r\u00e9 and the older\n> writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling\n> of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness.^[6]\n\n  * Poet and satirist Edward Young:\n\n> The love of praise, howe'er concealed by art,\n>\n> Reigns more or less supreme in every heart; The Proud to gain it, toils on\n> toils endure;\n>\n> The modest shun it, but to make it sure!^[7]\n\n  * Politician William Bennett:\n\n> Happiness is like a cat, if you try to coax it or call it, it will avoid\n> you; it will never come. But if you pay no attention to it and go about your\n> business, you'll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your\n> lap.^[8]^[9]\n\n  * Novelist Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa:\n\n> Happiness is found only in little moments of inattention.^[10]\n\n## Suggested explanations[edit]\n\nHappiness is often imprecisely equated with pleasure. If, for whatever reason,\none does equate happiness with pleasure, then the paradox of hedonism arises.\nWhen one aims solely towards pleasure itself, one's aim is frustrated. Henry\nSidgwick comments on such frustration after a discussion of self-love in the\nabove-mentioned work:\n\n> I should not, however, infer from this that the pursuit of pleasure is\n> necessarily self-defeating and futile; but merely that the principle of\n> Egoistic Hedonism, when applied with a due knowledge of the laws of human\n> nature, is practically self-limiting; i.e., that a rational method of\n> attaining the end at which it aims requires that we should to some extent\n> put it out of sight and not directly aim at it.^[11]\n\nWhile not addressing the paradox directly, Aristotle commented on the futility\nof pursuing pleasure. Human beings are actors whose endeavours bring about\nconsequences, and among these is pleasure. Aristotle then argues as follows:\n\n> How, then, is it that no one is continuously pleased? Is it that we grow\n> weary? Certainly all human things are incapable of continuous activity.\n> Therefore pleasure also is not continuous; for it accompanies activity.^[12]\n\nSooner or later, finite beings will be unable to acquire and expend the\nresources necessary to maintain their sole goal of pleasure; thus, they find\nthemselves in the company of misery. Evolutionary theory explains that humans\nevolved through natural selection and follow genetic imperatives that seek to\nmaximize reproduction,^[13] not happiness. As a result of these selection\npressures, the extent of human happiness is limited biologically.^[citation\nneeded] David Pearce argues in his treatise The Hedonistic Imperative that\nhumans might be able to use genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and\nneuroscience to eliminate suffering in all human life and allow for peak\nlevels of happiness and pleasure that are currently unimaginable.^[citation\nneeded]\n\nCompeting philosophies seek to balance hedonism with good acts and intentions,\nthus \"earning\" the pleasure.^[14]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Altruism\n  * Anti-consumerism\n  * Cognitive dissonance\n  * Crab mentality\n  * Easterlin paradox\n  * False pleasure\n  * Hedonic treadmill\n  * Intrinsic value\n  * Leisure satisfaction\n  * Psychological egoism\n  * Rat race\n  * Tantalus\n  * Willpower paradox\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ \"Paradox of Hedonism\".
