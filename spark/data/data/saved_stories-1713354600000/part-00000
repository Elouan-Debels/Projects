The viral sensation burned hot and bright, fueling\ndozens of social media videos and how-to articles on how to make a photo-\nfriendly spread. Sparked by influencer Justine Doiron, the butter board was a\nself-made social media food trend from an innovative content creator. But one\ngroup wanted to take credit for it: Dairy Management Inc. (DMI), an industry\norganization that pays influencers to help promote the consumption of dairy.\n\nFollowing backlash, Doiron clarified that while she had published videos in\npartnership with dairy in the past, the butter board video was entirely her\nown and not secretly an ad. The video that was an ad, she notes, was clearly\ndenoted as such. (Doiron and DMI did not respond to requests for comment.)\nStill, the controversy highlighted a growing reality: In recent years, a new\ngenre of food industry ads has grown on social media, and sometimes they\u2019re\nhard to spot.\n\nTia Mowry, of \u201990s ABC sitcom Sister, Sister fame, has been paid by Big\nBlueberry. As a celebrity spokesperson for an industry organization called the\nUS Highbush Blueberry Council, she has posted a smoothie recipe that doubled\nas an ad for blueberries. But when she later posted a blueberry muffin video,\nit was not marked as a blueberry ad but as promotion for her cookware line. As\nDoiron\u2019s and Mowry\u2019s examples show, the lines get blurry when you\u2019re promoting\nan unbranded agricultural commodity.\n\nAdvertising for agricultural foods isn\u2019t new. If you\u2019ve watched TV or flipped\nthrough a magazine in the past three decades, you\u2019ve probably seen advertising\nfrom organizations that want you to consume more of whatever agricultural\nproduct they represent\u2014from dairy (Got Milk?) to California raisins (I Heard\nIt Through the Grapevine) to beef (It\u2019s What\u2019s for Dinner). These new ads are\nsimilar, but because social media campaigns and influencer deals are just a\nfraction of the cost of TV ads, more food products are now jumping into the\ngame. The National Mango Board has paid chef and actor Ayesha Curry to make a\nmango slaw, while Potatoes USA has enlisted TikTok influencers like a former\npro footballer and a registered dietitian. The dairy industry, one of the most\ncashed-up groups, has also sponsored a MrBeast video, which as of publication\ntime has more than 34 million views.\n\nThe ads from these organizations, called checkoff boards, have government\nbacking of sorts. Farmers need to vote to form a board\u2014potato farmers for a\npotato board, peach farmers for a peach board, and so on\u2014which is then\noverseen by the US Department of Agriculture. The farmers then need to pay a\nfee to the checkoff board (usually linked to the amount they produce\u2014say, one\ncent per thousand pounds of potatoes or peaches). The board is then free to\nuse that money as it sees fit to grow demand for whatever product it\nrepresents. Most checkoff boards split the money between advertising and\nresearch\u2014the latter of which could include working with food scientists to\ndevelop America\u2019s new favorite snack, or funding scientific studies to show\noff the virtues of peanuts, popcorn, or whatever other food.\n\nThe research side of the checkoff world has yielded a surprising array of food\ninnovations, like Egg Beaters, the pre-cracked eggs in a milk carton-esque\ncontainer that was developed with the help of the American Egg Board. Some\ncheckoff boards have taken a more branded approach to developing consumer\nproducts that use as much of their respective commodity as possible. The beef\nand dairy lobbies, for instance, have used their budgets to help devise fast\nfood Frankensteins like Taco Bell\u2019s Grilled Stuft Burrito, Domino\u2019s Philly\nCheese Steak Pizza, and Pizza Hut\u2019s 3-Cheese Stuffed Crust Pizza, according to\nhistorian Sarah Milov. And in 2007, the national dairy checkoff not only\nworked with Domino\u2019s to create pizzas that used 40% more cheese, it paid for\nthe advertising campaign behind them.\n\nNow, as media has evolved, so has checkoff board advertising. Unlike a\ncelebrity spokesperson in the \u201990s print ads who may not have had particularly\nstrong opinions about, say, milk or beef, many influencers say they only\npromote products that they personally believe in. Sammi Haber Brondo, a\nregistered dietitian who\u2019s worked with a number of produce boards, including\nPotatoes USA, told me that she follows strict criteria for her influencing\ncampaigns. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t aligned with the product, I would not work with it,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cIt has to align with me and my nutrition philosophy as a dietitian\nwith a private practice and as someone who has a social media platform.\u201d\n\nAll the influencers who talked to me spoke genuinely about their appreciation\nof the various foods they had promoted. Melissa Harrison, who owns Montana-\nbased catering service Seasonal Montana, says that she has worked with\nPotatoes USA due to her genuine love of that versatile tuber. \u201cI cherish the\npotato,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so universal. Everybody loves potatoes.\u201d\n\nBut the boom in social media advertising for foods has drawn criticism,\nusually toward boards with big budgets like beef, pork, and dairy. Democratic\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah\nrecently introduced a bill in hopes of reforming the boards, which they argue\ndon\u2019t even help smaller farms and sometimes participate in \u201cwasteful, anti-\ncompetitive, and deceptive behavior.\u201d For example, one complaint is that\npartnerships with fast-food companies (as the Dairy Board has done with\nDomino\u2019s and Pizza Hut) only benefit big, industrial dairy companies. (Several\ntrade groups that work with checkoff boards have widely denied accusations\nthat they misuse money.)\n\nMany checkoff programs also take a subtle approach as they seek to target\nyounger consumers\u2014and some critics say that a government-endorsed program\nshouldn\u2019t feature advertisements that could counter overall wellness. Unlike\nother forms of influencing, ads from checkoff groups are technically no\ndifferent from government PSAs like Smokey Bear or McGruff the Crime Dog. It\ndoesn\u2019t quite mean, \u201cThe government wants them to say it,\u201d clarifies Helen\nNorton, a law professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. But it does\nbasically mean, \u201cThe government is willing to support it.\u201d That may be fine\nand good when it comes to sheet-pan salmon with potatoes and peas, a recipe\nthat one dietitian and influencer worked on with Potatoes USA. But a beef\nburger with bacon jam, as celebrity chef Josh Capon developed with the beef\nboard as part of another campaign, raises questions.\n\nThe USDA doesn\u2019t really draw any lines: It approves checkoff advertising as\nlong as it\u2019s factual, whether or not the product fits national health\nstandards. It can also technically veto these ads. Influencers who have worked\non campaigns with checkoff boards say that, as a result, any information in\nthem must be true, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, a registered dietitian and\nnutritionist who has worked with checkoff boards for potatoes, grapes, and\npeanuts, among others. \u201cYou really cannot say, \u2018You will lose 20 pounds in\nfive days with this fruit.\u2019 So the sensationalism is not there.\u201d The\ninformation must be backed by research.\n\nThat said, critics say that some of the featured research is also funded by\nthe checkoff boards, which makes it less reliable. And Harry M. Kaiser,\nGellert Family Professor of Applied Economics and Management in Cornell\nUniversity\u2019s Dyson School, notes that it\u2019s very rare for checkoff advertising\nto be outright vetoed by the USDA. It usually only occurs if the ads are\ndenigrating another agricultural product. In one instance, Kaiser says, a\ndairy checkoff ad that would have insulted nondairy spreads was vetoed. \u201cThey\nsaid you\u2019re disparaging soybeans because that\u2019s what margarine is made out of.\nAnd we won\u2019t let you,\u201d he says. Even so, in early 2023, actress Aubrey Plaza\nsurfaced in a controversial campaign that indirectly made fun of plant-based\nmilk (or \u201cwood milk\u201d) on behalf of a dairy checkoff.\n\nIt may not be scandalous that government-endorsed blueberry recipes can appear\nin your feed: Blueberries are a tasty and inoffensive fruit, so there\u2019s no\nobvious downside. But studies have indicated that while consumers like\n\u201cnonintrusive\u201d advertising, they equally don\u2019t appreciate being manipulated.\nCheckoff board info tends to be reliable because it\u2019s subject to that USDA\noversight, but the influencer model used to push them can be done so for more\npernicious ends: A recent Washington Post investigation highlighted some\ninstances of some less scrupulous dietitian-influencers working with\ncorporate-funded entities to push certain ideas\u2014for example, American Beverage\nAssociation, a lobby group representing Coca-Cola and other companies\u2014although\nthese organizations are not checkoffs and not bound by the same rules.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of other gray areas. If an influencer devises a recipe as\npart of a checkoff campaign, there\u2019s the question of who owns that recipe.\nCheckoff boards tend to keep the rights, but not always\u2014and if the creator\nretains those rights, they could republish the recipe elsewhere. In these\nsituations, it\u2019s easy for something that looks innocuous to turn out to be\nadvertising, but just as easy for something that was advertising to be\nrepurposed as everyday content. In any case, next time you see a delicious-\nlooking recipe for say, honey-cashew butter or chicken tenders with mango\nslaw, it may be worth checking the caption or the tags a little closer to get\nthe full story of just how organic that recipe actually is\u2014both in terms of\nthe food and how it found its way to your feed.\n\nTim Forster is a freelance editor and food and culture writer based in Berlin,\nGermany.
