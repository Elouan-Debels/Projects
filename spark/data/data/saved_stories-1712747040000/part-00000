Civilization is going to collapse. Not in 1000 years,\nnot in 100 years, but within the lifetimes of most people alive today.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean humans will go extinct, but at the very least,\nbillions of people are going to die from disease, violence, starvation,\ndehydration, natural disasters, and war.\n\nHow do I know this? Because it has already begun.\n\nOur global industrial civilization has been headed for collapse for at least\n50 years. That\u2019s how long ago the human population went into overshoot, a\nconcept that is crucial to understand if you\u2019re going to make sense of the\nhorrors that await us in the 21st century.\n\n## What is Overshoot?\n\nEcological overshoot happens when the demands of a species exceed the\nregenerative capacity of the ecosystem. As the species multiplies, it consumes\nthe ecosystem faster and faster, and the population skyrockets. Once there is\nnothing left to eat, the population collapses.\n\nThis is the meta-problem of our time. When people talk about problems the\nworld is facing, they usually focus on climate change or biodiversity loss or\nthe threat of nuclear war, but all of these problems are merely symptoms of\novershoot. And yet, most leaders and politicians have never even heard of it.\n\nTo help you understand, let\u2019s take a look at a classic example of overshoot\nthat occurred on an island off the coast of Alaska.\n\n### The St. Matthew Island Reindeer Herd\n\nSt. Matthew Island is 128 square miles of tundra in the middle of the Bering\nSea, over 200 miles from the nearest Alaskan village. It is said to be the\nmost remote place in Alaska.\n\nPrior to World War II, it was unoccupied. Then in 1944, the Coast Guard\ninstalled a loran (long range aids to navigation) and put 19 men on the island\nto operate the station. In order to make sure the men had a backup food\nsource, the Coast Guard released 29 reindeer onto the island.\n\nFor the reindeer, it was heaven. There were no predators, there was grass\neverywhere, and the tree trunks were covered with lichen, which is like candy\nto reindeer.\n\nWhen World War II began drawing to a close, the men were pulled from the\nisland and the reindeer were left behind. Over the next decade, they began\nbreeding prolifically.\n\nThirteen years later in 1957, Dave Klein, a biologist working for the U.S.\nFish and Wildlife Service, visited St. Matthew Island. He and his assistant\ncounted about 1,350 reindeer, all of which appeared to be very well-fed. With\nmats of lichen several inches thick, the island had plenty of food for the\npopulation of reindeer to grow exponentially.\n\nIn 1963, Klein returned to the island with three other scientists. As soon as\nthey arrived, they saw reindeer everywhere. Incredibly, they counted 6,000\nreindeer. However, the deer did not appear to be as fat and healthy as before,\nand the land showed signs of overgrazing.\n\nHe returned again in 1966, and what he found was horrifying. The island was\nlittered with deer skeletons, and there were only 42 living deer left, all of\nwhich were emaciated. This means the population had plummeted by 99% in just a\nfew years.\n\nSo why did this happen? Most people are perplexed when they hear this story.\nWhy didn\u2019t the reindeer population grow to the island\u2019s carrying capacity,\nthen level off?\n\nThe answer is overshoot. Most people would assume that if there were 6,000\ndeer living on an island, then the carrying capacity must be somewhere above\n6,000. In reality, the carrying capacity was probably more like 1,000 or\n2,000. The deer population grew faster than the local flora could regenerate.\n\nSo why did the population of deer grow so quickly? Because of exponential\ngrowth. People have a tendency to think of growth as steady and linear, but\nlife doesn\u2019t grow that way. As long as there are no limiting factors like\npredators, diseases, or lack of food, a population of animals will keep\ndoubling until something stops it.\n\nIn the case of St. Matthew Island, the deer population doubled every 2-3 years\nuntil 1960 or so, when growth began to slow down. Finally, once 99% of the\nfood was gone, there was a mass die-off, leaving only 42 surviving reindeer.\n(There\u2019s a great comic by Stuart McMillen that tells this story. You can read\nit here.)\n\nAnd that is not the only time this has happened to a herd of reindeer. Similar\nincidents occurred on St. Paul Island near Alaska and on the Kaibab Plateau in\nArizona.\n\nNow take a look at the human population since the advent of agriculture, and\nask yourself, \u201cWhat is going to happen next?\u201d\n\n### The Population Bomb\n\nPrior to 10,000 BCE, humans were hunter-gatherers, and with that lifestyle,\nthey had already reached the carrying capacity of the planet. Back then,\ntemperatures varied wildly, going up and down by several degrees Celsius from\none millennium to the next.\n\nThen something amazing happened: Earth\u2019s climate became incredibly stable, and\nfor the next 12,000 years, all the way up until the 20th century, the average\nglobal temperature stayed within a range of less than 1 degree Celsius. This\nera is known as the Holocene.\n\nThanks to this stable new area, the weather became much more predictable.\nInstead of alternating periods of drought and flooding, farmers could now\nexpect about the same amount of rainfall every year. This allowed farms to\nexpand rapidly, drastically increasing the local carrying capacity for humans.\n\nSlowly but surely, the human population began to grow (about 0.04% per year).\nHowever, there were still limiting factors that kept growth in check. Things\nlike wars and diseases.\n\nRegardless, the population kept growing, and by the 1700s, growth was\nbeginning to go exponential. Humans came up with new inventions such as the\nwater frame and the steam engine, which allowed them to produce more goods. By\nthe 1800s, even more inventions came along such as electric generators and\nincandescent lamps.\n\nThe most important thing about these inventions is that they allowed people to\nharness more energy. More energy means more stuff and more food. As people\u2019s\nstandard of living improved, they were able to have more children, causing the\npopulation to grow even faster.\n\nUntil the late 1800s, the primary sources of energy were wood, coal, and whale\noil. But with the discovery of oil fields all across America in the early\n1900s, everything changed. Oil was much more adaptable and flexible, and it\nhad twice the energy-density of coal. Plus, it was much easier to get it out\nof the ground.\n\nWith all this new energy, living standards and populations grew even faster.\nSuddenly, people were inventing automobiles, radios, airplanes, and\ntelevisions. It seemed as though there were enough energy to last forever.\n\nHowever, there were some who warned that the age of abundance would not last\nforever. In 1968, Paul Ehrlich and his wife Anne Ehrlich, both biologists,\nwrote a book called The Population Bomb. It warned that before long,\noverpopulation would lead to worldwide famine. This seemed plausible as most\nof the world\u2019s best farmland was already being used, and the population growth\nrate had skyrocketed to over 2% per year.\n\nEarly editions of the book began with the following statement:\n\n\u201cThe battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions\nof people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon\nnow. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world\ndeath rate.\u201d\n\nOf course, Ehrlich turned out to be wrong, and the population grew from only\n3.5 billion back then to over 8 billion today.\n\nSo does that mean we can all relax and stop worrying about overpopulation?\nHardly. Ehrlich was wrong because he didn\u2019t anticipate the Green Revolution,\nwhich took off in the 1970s.\n\nFarmers began to use new chemical fertilizers such as phosphorous and ammonia\n(which is derived from natural gas), and agrochemicals such as pesticides and\nherbicides (which are derived from oil). In addition, they began to use new\ntypes of farming equipment that mechanized cultivation and harvesting.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. In the past, a drought meant a much lower crop yield, but\nnew technologies allowed farmers to pump water out of deep underground\naquifers. Also, scientists developed new high-yield crop varieties that never\nexisted in nature.\n\nOne of the key scientists was Norman Borlaug, who won the Nobel Peace Price in\n1970 and is credited with saving over a billion people from starvation.\nWithout the Green Revolution, the world population probably would have peaked\nsomewhere around 4 billion.\n\n## Overshoot and Collapse\n\nThanks to all these new forms of energy and technology, humans have vastly\nincreased the carrying capacity of the planet. However, this increased\ncarrying capacity is an illusion. William R. Catton, author of Overshoot: The\nEcological Basis of Revolutionary Change, called it \u201cphantom carrying\ncapacity.\u201d\n\nOur ability to feed 8 billion people is completely dependent on fossil fuels\nsuch as oil and natural gas. Once we begin to run out of them, they will\nbecome much more expensive, which means everything else\u2014especially food\u2014will\nbecome much more expensive as well.\n\n### Peak Oil\n\nPeak oil is the point at which the production (or rather, extraction) of oil\npeaks then goes into decline. Because there is a finite amount of oil on this\nplanet, peak oil is going to happen eventually. The only question is when. But\nnow, there are signs that peak oil already happened a few years ago.\n\nOf course, oil companies continue to discover new oil fields, but they\u2019re not\ndiscovering them fast enough to keep up with demand. In fact, new oil\ndiscoveries are at their lowest level in 75 years. Even Saudi Aramco, the\nworld\u2019s largest oil producer, has warned that their spare capacity is\n\u201cextremely low.\u201d\n\nIf we truly have reached peak oil, then we are in big trouble. As I explained\nearlier, population growth is directly tied to energy usage. Without plenty of\naffordable energy, we cannot continue to grow our population or even maintain\nit. Thus the term, \u201cphantom carrying capacity.\u201d\n\nThere are people who say we don\u2019t have to worry about peak oil because we are\nswitching to new technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and electric\nvehicles. However, the switch isn\u2019t happening fast enough, and we still use\nfossil fuels to manufacture so-called renewables (for example, the plastic in\nthem is made from oil).\n\nBesides, all this green energy requires another finite resource: rare-earth\nmetals. The great thing about oil is that all of the energy is already stored\ninside of it. But for renewable energy, we need to store the energy in\nbatteries so we can drive vehicles and power our homes even when the sun isn\u2019t\nshining and the wind isn\u2019t blowing. And for batteries, we need metals like\nlithium, cobalt, and nickel.\n\nThe problem is, new research suggests that there simply aren\u2019t enough rare-\nearth metals in the ground for a green energy revolution. The fact that so few\npeople anticipated this problem boggles the mind.\n\nEven if there were enough metals for a green revolution, we still need natural\ngas to keep growing food on such a large scale. This is because of the\nHaber\u2013Bosch process. This scientific breakthrough gave us the ability to\nderive ammonia from natural gas, and the ammonia is used to create fertilizer\n(part of the Green Revolution mentioned above).\n\nAbout 50% of the world\u2019s food production depends on fertilizer that is created\nthis way. There is no substitute. This is why fertilizer prices (and thus,\nfood prices) are getting higher and higher, because natural gas has gotten so\nexpensive. What happens when we run out?\n\nHumans have essentially painted themselves into a corner. We have to keep\nusing fossil fuels to maintain the population, but if we do that, eventually\nwe will run out of fossil fuels and the population will collapse. Sure, we\ncould produce more renewables and try to use fewer fossil fuels, but that\nwould only delay the inevitable.\n\nThere is no way out of this mess.\n\n### Degraded Carrying Capacity\n\nAs terrifying as this information is, the situation is even worse than you\nthink.\n\nWhen a species overshoots the carrying capacity of an ecosystem, the carrying\ncapacity is degraded. To make this more clear, let\u2019s take another look at the\nreindeer on St. Matthew Island.\n\nThe deer mostly ate grass in the spring and summer, then lichen in the fall\nand winter. During the winter, the grass roots would remain dormant until they\nstarted growing again in the spring.\n\nAt some point, there were too many deer and not enough grass. Once the deer\nate all the grass and couldn\u2019t find anymore lichen, they dug up the grass\nroots and ate those as well. This got them through the winter, but it meant\nthat less grass grew in the spring.\n\nThis is a classic example of overshoot and degraded carrying capacity. The\ndeer overgrazed to the point where the island could support less deer than it\ncould before they went into overshoot. Here\u2019s a graphic that shows what I\nmean:\n\nIn the same way that reindeer degraded the carrying capacity of St. Matthew\nIsland, humans have degraded the carrying capacity of the planet Earth. The\nsigns are everywhere.\n\nTopsoil is eroding faster than it can regenerate. Since farmers began tilling\nsoil in the Midwest in the 19th century, over 50 billion tons of topsoil has\neroded.\n\nAccording to the USDA, the erosion rate is double what is believed to be\nsustainable. Some experts believe all the topsoil will be gone in less than 60\nyears, after which it will be nearly impossible to grow food.\n\nAquifers are emptying faster than they can refill. This is very worrying since\naquifers provide one-third of the planet\u2019s drinking water and nearly half of\nthe planet\u2019s irrigated agriculture.\n\nFor example, the Ogallala aquifer, which stretches from South Dakota down to\nTexas, could be almost gone in just 20 years. After that, Midwestern farmers\nwill be out of business. Countries around the world are facing the same\nproblem with their own aquifers.\n\nForests are being cut down faster than they can regrow. Forests aren\u2019t just\nfor creating furniture, construction materials, and other wood products.\nThey\u2019re also used for energy.\n\nIn the European Union, burning trees for energy is considered renewable since\ntrees can regrow. The problem is, they\u2019re burning them faster than they can\ngrow back. This is terrible for the environment as forests are needed to\npurify the air and water. We are literally burning down our life support\nsystem.\n\nFisheries are being plundered faster than they can restock. This is very bad\nnews for the 3 billion people who rely on fish as a significant source of\nprotein in their diets, not to mention 10% of the world population who rely on\nfishing for income.\n\nSo if you thought that we could make up of for the loss of good farmland and\naquifers with seafood, think again. It is very possible that the oceans could\nbe virtually empty of fish by 2048.\n\nAnd of course, fossil fuels are being extracted far faster than they can\nreplenish. It takes millions of years for sunlight to be stored in the form of\nfossil fuels, so for human purposes, fossil fuels are a one-time deal. Once\nthey\u2019re gone, that\u2019s it. And it looks like we\u2019ve already extracted all the\n\u201clow hanging fruit.\u201d\n\nAll this technology allowed humans to vastly increase the carrying capacity of\nthe planet, but it is a temporary increase. Technology merely delays collapse,\nwhich ensures that once collapse arrives, it will happen much more quickly.\n\n### Earth Overshoot Day\n\nAt this point, there are two big questions we need to answer. The first one\nis: Have we overshot the carrying capacity of the Earth yet?\n\nWe can get a clue to the answer by looking at research done by the Global\nFootprint Network. Every year, they calculate the date when humans have used\nall the natural resources that the planet can generate that year. It\u2019s called\nEarth Overshoot Day, and this year it was on July 28.\n\nThis means that for our civilization to continue functioning after July 28, it\nit has to draw down resources that had accumulated long before humans came\nalong. Resources like the ones mentioned above: topsoil, aquifers, forests,\nfisheries, and fossil fuels. Eventually, they will all be gone.\n\nSo clearly we are already in overshoot, but how long have we been in\novershoot? Take a look:\n\nAs you can see, we have been in overshoot since 1971. Over 50 years ago. Back\nthen, the global population was about 3.7 billion, which suggests that the\nactual carrying capacity of the planet is somewhere below 3.7 billion.\n\nOf course, this depends on people\u2019s lifestyles. If everyone on Earth lived\nlike people in Bangladesh, there wouldn\u2019t be an Earth Overshoot Day. But if\neveryone on Earth lived like people in the United States, then Earth Overshoot\nDay would be on March 13. However, for the purposes of this article, we\u2019ll\njust look at the world population as a whole.\n\n### Limits to Growth\n\nOvershoot and collapse go hand in hand. If we\u2019ve overshot the carrying\ncapacity of our planet, then collapse is inevitable.\n\nSo now there\u2019s a second question we need to answer: How much longer until the\nhuman population collapses?\n\nTo answer this, let\u2019s take a look at research conducted by MIT and published\nby the Club of Rome back in 1972. They wanted to find out how much longer\nindustrial civilization could last before running out of essential resources.\nTo figure this out, they looked at five factors:\n\n  1. Resources\n  2. Industrial Output\n  3. Pollution\n  4. Food\n  5. Population\n\nOnce they had this data, they developed the World3 model, a system dynamics\nmodel that uses computers to simulate interactions between these five factors\nin order to determine how they affect each other.\n\nThey ran several different scenarios. For example, what if we start living\nmore sustainably? What if we find new ways to increase the planet\u2019s carrying\ncapacity? And what if we don\u2019t do anything and just continue business as\nusual?\n\nAccording the business-as-usual scenario (BAU2), economic growth would peak in\nthe 2030s, and civilization would begin to collapse around 2040. Here\u2019s what\nit looks like:\n\nThe researchers compiled everything they learned and published it in a book\ncalled Limits to Growth. It quickly became a bestseller, but it was also very\ncontroversial.\n\nPoliticians, economists, and business leaders bristled at the idea that\neconomic growth could have limits, which makes sense because their jobs are to\nensure fast and limitless growth in order to keep voters and investors happy.\nAs Upton Sinclair said, \u201cIt is difficult to get a man to understand something,\nwhen his salary depends on his not understanding it.\u201d\n\nSince this research was done 50 years ago, we can now look at data from the\npast five decades and see how accurate the researchers actually were. And\nthat\u2019s exactly what Gaya Herrington, a student at Harvard University, decided\nto do.\n\nShe said, \u201cGiven the unappealing prospect of collapse, I was curious to see\nwhich scenarios were aligning most closely with empirical data today. After\nall, the book that featured this world model was a bestseller in the 70s, and\nby now we\u2019d have several decades of empirical data which would make a\ncomparison meaningful. But to my surprise I could not find recent attempts for\nthis. So I decided to do it myself.\u201d\n\nFor her Masters thesis, she looked at ten factors:\n\n  1. Population\n  2. Fertility Rates\n  3. Mortality Rates\n  4. Industrial Output\n  5. Food Production\n  6. Services\n  7. Non-renewable Resources\n  8. Persistent Pollution\n  9. Human Welfare\n  10. Ecological Footprint\n\nWhat she found was terrifying. It seems that humans have been following the\nbusiness-as-usual scenario more closely than any other scenario.\n\nOf course, no study is perfect. The population could begin to go down before\n2030, or it might not go down until many years after 2030. But no matter what,\nit seems certain that it will go down within the next few decades.\n\nUnless you are hundreds of years old, you have never lived during a time when\nthe global population went down. Even during terrible times like the Spanish\nflu or World War II, the population continued to grow. Once it starts going\ndown, it will likely be due to a famine unlike any we\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nEarlier I said that our ability to feed 8 billion people is completely\ndependent on fossil fuels. However, there is something else we also need:\nstable weather patterns. But thanks to climate change, stable weather patterns\nare going away, too.\n\nMany people see climate change as the biggest challenge of our time, but the\ntruth is that climate change is merely a symptom of overshoot. It\u2019s\nessentially a waste-management problem. Humans have been burning wood and coal\nfor thousands of years, but the trees and oceans were always able to absorb\nthe excess carbon dioxide.\n\nNow, we are emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases so quickly that\nthere is no way the planet can absorb it all. The oceans have absorbed most of\nit, but that has caused them to become more acidic, leading to the destruction\nof coral reefs. Forests used to absorb a lot of it, but they are being cut\ndown so quickly that they now act as a carbon source instead of a carbon sink.\n\nDespite nearly 30 years of COP summits and pledges by nations to slash\nemissions, things are worse than ever. In fact, in the 34 years since\nscientists first testified to Congress about the dangers of global warming, we\nhave emitted more greenhouse gasses than in all of history before that.\n\nAs a result of all these greenhouses gases floating around, more and more heat\nfrom the sun will be trapped in the atmosphere, and temperatures will rise\u2014not\njust linearly, but exponentially.\n\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.2\u00b0C since the late 1800s (before the\noil boom), but half of that warming has happened in the last 30 years. That\nmeans the average global temperature increase doubled in the last 30 years,\nand it looks as though it will double again in the next 30 years. Classic\nexponential growth.\n\nMany people say that climate change is a natural process, and they\u2019re right.\nAs I mentioned above, climate change has been occurring ever since the Earth\nformed. However, except for times when the Earth was struck by asteroids, it\nhas never changed anywhere near this quickly.\n\nThe last 7 years were also the 7 warmest years in recorded history. Just look\nat how fast temperatures are rising:\n\nThis is not normal. Humans have impacted the environment so severely that\naccording to many scientists, the Holocene epoch is over and we are entering a\nnew epoch know as the Anthropocene.\n\nWhat can we expect in the Anthropocene? Well, given that we are already seeing\nrecord-breaking droughts, floods, heat waves, and biodiversity loss at 1.2\u00b0C\nof warming, we can only imagine how bad things will be when the temperature\nincrease doubles again over the next 30 years.\n\n### Accelerating Collapse\n\nEven if there were no such thing as climate change, we would still be headed\nfor collapse in the next few decades. But unfortunately, climate change is\nvery real, and it will only accelerate the collapse.\n\nA great example is what has happened to the aquifers mentioned above. We are\nrapidly using up all of our groundwater, but we wouldn\u2019t have to if it weren\u2019t\nfor drought. Currently, countries all over the world are experiencing some of\ntheir worst droughts in centuries, something climate scientists have been\npredicting for decades.\n\nThanks to drought, crop yields all around the world are beginning to decline.\nFloods are also causing problems for farmers. Recently, half of Pakistan\u2019s\nbreadbasket was wiped out by the worst flood in over 70 years. We can expect\nsimilar disasters in other breadbaskets around the world.\n\nAnother great example is what\u2019s happening to ocean life. Recently, snow crab\nseason was cancelled for the first time in history due to the disappearance of\nbillions of snow crabs.\n\nThe most likely explanation is warming oceans. Snow crabs hatch in extremely\ncold water, but since the Bering sea has been warmer than usual lately, it is\npossible that the warmer waters made the snow crabs more susceptible to\ndiseases and predators. We were already overfishing in the Bering sea, and now\nclimate change has made the problem even worse.\n\nExtreme weather doesn\u2019t just affect crop yields and fisheries, it also affects\nsupply chains. Possibly the most important part of the United States supply\nchain is the Mississippi river, and right now it is at a record low.\n\nAs a result, the water is too low for most barges to traverse, and at least\n2000 of them are backed up. As Mike Ellis, CEO of American Commercial Barge\nLine, said, \u201cAmerica is going to shut down if we shut down.\u201d\n\nAll this is happening while the global population continues to grow. This is\nunsustainable, to put it mildly. Climate change not only accelerates collapse,\nit magnifies the consequences of collapse.\n\n## How Did We Get Here?\n\nMost people refuse to believe that our civilization is unsustainable and\nheaded for collapse in the near future. There are people who have been\npresented with all the facts mentioned in this article who still refuse to\naccept the truth.\n\nBut why? There are many possibilities, but I think a big one is cultural\nconditioning. Ever since we were born, we were all taught by the media that\ntechnology is a good thing. They say technology is progress, and the more\ntechnology we have, the freer and happier society will be. Like in Star Trek.\n\nSo when you tell people that actually, technology is destroying the planet and\nleading us toward collapse, they find it impossible to believe. They\u2019ll even\nsay that what we need now is more technology. But unfortunately, we can\u2019t\nsolve our problems with the same methods that got us into this predicament.\n\nThere are countless peer-reviewed studies demonstrating that we are in\novershoot right now and that we are headed for a hunter-gatherer future. These\nstudies are based on empirical data and basic math, yet many environmentalists\nrefuse to believe it. They say growth is fine, we just need to switch to\n\u201cgreen growth.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just cultural conditioning that does this to people; it\u2019s also\nfear. When I first realized that society will probably collapse in my\nlifetime, I tried really hard to convince myself that it wasn\u2019t true. I\nstarted learning about techno fixes, green energy, and sustainable growth. It\ntook me a long time before I finally realized that sustainable growth is an\noxymoron.\n\nEver since the Limits to Growth study back in 1972, it has been clear that our\nglobal civilization would collapse someday, but few people believed it. Only\nnow that resource depletion and climate disasters are becoming such obvious\nproblems are people finally starting to wake up.\n\n## What Now?\n\nAs more and more people wake up to the reality of collapse, it is absolutely\ncrucial that we help them understand why collapse is happening.\n\nThe entire history of humans throughout the Holocene is characterized by\novershoot and collapse. When societies exceeded the carrying capacities of\ntheir ecosystems, they usually either went to war with neighboring societies\nor devolved into civil war.\n\nMy fear is that when the economy collapses and things start to get really bad,\npeople will blame others. The others could be anybody: Jews, immigrants, white\npeople, minorities, fascists, socialists, the patriarchy, the \u201cwoke mob\u201d, or\nother nations such as Russia or China.\n\nWe must understand that collapse is not the fault of some malignant \u201cother.\u201d\nCollapse is the inevitable result of overshoot, and overshoot is everybody\u2019s\nfault. Yes, some people are more to blame than others, but unless you\u2019ve lived\nyour entire life off-the-grid and self-sufficient, you too have contributed to\novershoot.\n\nWe need to stop blaming each other and start working together. We need to\ncreate a culture based on sustainability instead of consumption, a culture\nwhere we care more about leaving things to our children than acquiring things\nfor ourselves. We need to eliminate the idea that humans are separate from\nnature and remember that we are all part of nature.\n\nUntil we do these things, I fear that we will only make our predicament worse.\nI\u2019ll close with a quote from William Catton, author of Overshoot: The\nEcological Basis of Revolutionary Change:\n\n\u201cI have tried to show the real nature of humanity\u2019s predicament, not because\nunderstanding its nature will enable us to escape it, but because if we do not\nunderstand it, we shall continue to act and react in ways that make it worse.\u201d\n\n### Published by:\n\n### You might also like...\n\nFeb\n\n29\n\n## The Collapse Will Be Normalized\n\nAs civilization collapses, the media will attempt to normalize things like\nwar, famine, and genocide.
