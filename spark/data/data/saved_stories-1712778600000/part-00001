We're gonna learn how to make world-class thumbnails\ntoday.\n\nThumbnails come in many forms and they are the reason people check your\nprofile (pfp) on social media, or buy your book by checking its cover.\n\nOr click a link on your newsletter on Social Media. But we will be using an\nexample of YouTube video.\n\nMake no mistake, thumbnails are everywhere. People do judge a book by its\ncover.\n\nToday's topics:\n\n  1. The hottest side-hustle in AI: YouTube Thumbnails\n\n  2. A site that lets you find overlapping subreddits\n\n  3. One recommended video on the multi-disciplinary approach to thinking\n\n### YouTube Thumbnails x AI\n\nThis is the hottest AI side-hustle right now.\n\nYou can learn it in 1 week and start making easy money with it.\n\nWhy easy? Because AI will create the image in 5 minutes and make you $250 per\nthumbnail.\n\nYes, this is not a joke. Its a real story covered by Rest Of World.\n\nThis is a deep-dive into the YouTube Thumbnail industry with links on how to\nmake viral thumbnails and how many formats (yes, there is a finite number) are\nthere so you can copy them.\n\nAnd the best part? This skill can be used in other industries as well so you\nlearn this skill once & can use it everywhere from Movie Posters to Ebook\nDesigns to T-Shirt Designs to Big Banner Ads.\n\nIf you are looking for getting started videos that'll take you from 0 to 100\nin the shortest possible time, you can watch all of these in the exact order\nas listed below:\n\n  1.
