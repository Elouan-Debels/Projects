It is converted using\nPunycode, which is a way to represent Unicode with the limited character\nsubset of ASCII.\n\nCertain Top-Level Domains (TLDs) support certain characters. For example, the\n.io TLD supports characters from languages like Chinese, Korean, and Arabic.\n\nThese unicode names fall under something known as Internationalized Domain\nNames (IDNs), originally created in 1990. The obvious question is whether or\nnot this is a security risk. The answer is yes, but modern browsers prevent\nthese so-called homograph attacks in a variety of ways. Chrome, in particular,\nshowns the unicode for valid domains, but alerts the users when the domain\ncould be a homograph attack.\n\nNamecheap created a comprehensive table of TLDs that support IDNs.\n\nOriginally inspired by \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udfba.tk.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please reach out to us at i@\u4e00.io\n\n", "frontpage": false}
