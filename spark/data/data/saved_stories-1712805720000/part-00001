But then it all\nwent wrong. Boom/Bust: The Rise and Fall of HQ Trivia tells the story of the\nonce-viral trivia app and examines vagaries of the attention economy.\n\nSubscribe: Spotify / Apple / Stitcher\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of mythologizing around Silicon Valley giants and the\npartnerships that start them. When I was growing up, my mom worked at HP. It\nwas 2000 and the company wasn\u2019t exactly thriving under the direction of CEO\nCarly Fiorina. And I remember my mom being baffled by its decision to spend\n$1.7 million on the modest Palo Alto home\u2014and more specifically, the extremely\nmodest Palo Alto garage\u2014where Bill Hewlett and David Packard built their first\ndevice. It was already a designated California Historic Landmark, but HP\ncompletely refurbished it and turned it into a museum. If you visit it today,\na plaque on the outside of the home calls it \u201cthe birthplace of Silicon\nValley.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Bill and David\u2019s accomplishments were historic. But\nthe legacies of early Silicon Valley giants have motivated today\u2019s CEOs\u2014who\nare known for their large egos\u2014to internalize the importance of their work,\nand do their best to tout it, early and often.\n\nThe brief history of Silicon Valley also tells us that the effort to secure a\nlegacy can sometimes play out in ugly ways, especially when a company is\nfounded as a partnership. A working relationship between two people with\ncomplementary skills can suffer when it\u2019s time to divvy up the spoils that\ncome from running a multimillion-dollar company. Microsoft cofounders Bill\nGates and Paul Allen, for instance, began as young equals, spending all their\nfree time tinkering on their high school\u2019s single teletype computer. But Allen\nlater revealed in his memoir that as the company grew, Gates became a\ncompetitive bully. Gates was so wrapped up in controlling Microsoft that he\ntried to force Allen out and cut his shares while Allen was recovering from\nlymphoma.\n\nApple\u2019s cofounders, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, have a similar story. They\nwere introduced when Woz was in college and Jobs was a senior at Homestead\nHigh School, my alma mater, and began collaborating on a handful of projects.\nEarly on in their partnership, Woz discovered that Jobs was secretly taking a\ncut of their earnings from work that relied on Woz\u2019s engineering.\n\nThough all these technologists have said that they nevertheless valued their\nworking relationships, they were clearly not without strife. Things get\ncrowded. And once a company gets big enough, so do its founders\u2019 egos.\n\nSo how did this founder dynamic play out in Rus Yusupov and Colin Kroll\u2019s\nrelationship? To understand what was at stake, you need to know what brought\nthem to a fancy Soho office with millions of dollars in VC funding. Way before\nHQ Trivia, their working relationship began more than a decade ago, at a\nluxury travel startup called Jetsetter.\n\nRus, Colin, and an engineer named Dominik Hofmann all helped build it from the\nground up. Rus\u2019s firm was contracted to do creative direction. Dom was doing\nuser experience, or UX, and Colin was covering the technical end. Drew\nPatterson, the company\u2019s CEO, remembers being especially impressed with Colin\nfrom his very first interview.\n\n\u201cHe had an energy and an inquisitiveness and a curiosity and an ambition that\nit was, like, absolutely, this is the person,\u201d says Patterson. \u201cHe was pushing\nme on the like, \u2018OK, what\u2019s the vision for how we\u2019re going to take over the\nworld? Where is this thing going? I\u2019m not interviewing for a job. I\u2019m\ninterviewing you to explain your vision to me and get me excited.\u2019\u201d\n\nColin was so adept at what he was doing that he eventually replaced his\nsupervisor and began running the engineering team himself. They all spent a\nlot of late nights working in this loft space in the Flatiron District. \u201cWe\u2019d\nend up getting takeout and work until midnight, one, two in the morning, and\nColin would be smoking cigarettes out the window,\u201d Patterson recalls. \u201cIt was\nnot without friction, right? Kind of like in the spirit of \u2018How do you get to\nthe right answer,\u2019 we had our arguments or creative process. But yeah, I mean\nI think we worked incredibly well together.\u201d\n\nThat was a matter of opinion, depending on who you were asking at the company.\nColin always threw himself into whatever project he was working on, but was\noften abrasive and dismissive of other people\u2019s ideas. And he seemed to be\naware of this, at least according to a Wall Street Journal story from last\nyear. Colin reportedly told his mentor at the time, \u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m an\nasshole, and I am an asshole, but I can\u2019t help it because everyone around me\nis so stupid.\u201d That tension came to a head in 2012, when both Drew and Colin\nwere booted from the company during an exodus of executives and a staff\nmutiny.\n\nDom, the UX engineer, was part of that exodus. He had other ideas anyway. He\nhad been toying with a concept for a video-editing tool. A product he was\ncalling Vine.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Vine was a pretty simple idea. Dom imagined a modern\nway to edit online clips recorded from your phone, stripped of all the\nunnecessary buttons and dials borrowed from analog technology. All you had to\ndo was touch to shoot and lift to pause. The software blended your footage\ntogether seamlessly, and in the end, you\u2019d get a looping six-second clip that\nfell somewhere between a GIF and a YouTube video.\n\nAfter leaving Jetsetter, Dom had enlisted Rus to help him design the product.\nBut it wasn\u2019t long until he realized he needed Colin\u2019s technical expertise to\nmake Vine shine from the inside. They were able to sort out their working\nrelationship under the common goal of making this cool new thing happen.\n\nAnd then, while they were still in beta, they had a meeting with Twitter to\ndiscuss a potential collaboration. At the time, Twitter was looking for a way\nto get a leg up on Facebook, which had just purchased Instagram.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he was at Vine more than a month or two when they had an\nopportunity to show Vine to Jack Dorsey, who founded Twitter,\u201d recalls Alan\nKroll, Colin\u2019s dad. \u201cHe was so impressed with this, they made an immediate\noffer. The guys didn\u2019t really want to sell it at that point. They came back\nwith a ridiculous\u2014double what they asked, and Twitter took it without even\nnegotiating.\u201d\n\nTwitter\u2019s acquisition of Vine made Dom, Colin, and Rus all very rich in both\nliteral capital and professional capital. Especially because, when the app was\nreleased in January 2013, it immediately hit a cultural nerve. Vine\u2019s user\nbase was producing these amazing memes at a dizzying rate. The fact that these\nclips were videos, not images or text, made them easily remixable. I remember\nthere was this one Vine where this kid spells out the word \u201ciridocyclitis\u201d at\na spelling bee. People just went wild with it.\n\nAs all of this was happening, songs from unknown artists on the platform were\nblowing up, and teens from all parts of the country were starring in their own\nvideos and becoming famous in the process. New faces like Logan Paul and Lele\nPons\u2014now famous YouTubers\u2014were landing real brand deals for their content.\n\nVine was laying the foundation for a newfound influencer economy. The only\nproblem was that Vine itself didn\u2019t have any kind of strategy to capitalize on\nthat. And Twitter, which was struggling to figure out its identity in the\nmarket, wasn\u2019t really in a place to help.\n\n\u201cThey could have put front-roll ads in front of Vines,\u201d says Verge editor\nCasey Newton, who was covering the company when things started going wrong.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t do that. They could have introduced some kind of paid partnership\nprogram with the Viners where they would split revenue for, like, paid\nplacements. They never did that. They did acquire a talent agency, and I think\nthe thought was that they would start to work with brands and take some brand\nmoney to work with big influencers to do some kind of promotional things. But\nthat basically never really got off the blocks.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Instagram launched its own video feature. And YouTube was luring\naway Vine\u2019s talent with an ads program that actually guaranteed creators some\nkind of stable income.\n\n\u201cI think because Twitter had so many other problems, with Vine it was always\nlike, \u2018We\u2019ll worry about the monetization later,\u2019\u201d says Newton. \u201cAnd then by\nthe time it came time to really worry about it, they decided to shut it down.\u201d\n\nThe day the shutdown was announced, Rus tweeted: \u201cDon\u2019t sell your company!\u201d\nThere was a sense that all the founders really lost something they loved. And\nnot only that, but whatever long-term legacy they were trying to build was cut\nshort.\n\n## Next Up In Boom/Bust: The Rise and Fall of HQ Trivia\n\n  * The End of HQ Trivia\u2014and the Rise of Zombie HQ\n  * \u201cYou\u2019re on Notice, HQ\u201d\n  * A Rebellion at HQ Trivia\n  * What Colin Kroll Meant to HQ Trivia\n  * Was HQ a Tech Company or a Media Company?\n  * Was HQ Trivia Too Viral?\n\n### Most Read\n\n  1.
