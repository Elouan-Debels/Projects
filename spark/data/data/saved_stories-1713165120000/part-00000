Both\nWincott and Samantha B\u00e9art, who played Karlach in BG3, expressed trepidation\nabout potential contractual abuses of AI performance cloning, even in the face\nof SAG-AFTRA's recent contract.\n\nActors from other games, like Alan Wake 2's David Harewood and Final Fantasy\n16's Ben Starr and Ralph Ineson, are similarly wary of the tech. Neil Newbon,\nwho voiced Astarion in BG3, seemed more optimistic due to the sheer gulf in\nquality between AI copies and real actors' performances, hoping that good\ntaste will win out: \"I know a lot of people in the games industry that would\nlike to work with an actor because of what we bring, the craft we bring.\n\n\"I don't think you can program craft. It's something beyond zeroes and ones,\nbeyond the formula. It's quite magical.\"\n\n## PC Gamer Newsletter\n\nSign up to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked\nby the editors.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nIt's pretty clear that voice actors don't want AI tools making a muck of their\nprofession, both from an artistic standpoint and in the interest of their own\nlivelihoods, but Amelia Tyler did bring up a particularly interesting edge\ncase: modding and small projects.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly with her and long time Elder Scrolls/Fallout actor Wes\nJohnson, who tweeted that \"anyone trying to create a mod using an actor's\nvoice via AI *without consent* knows they are wrong.\" AI voice cloning is an\nabuse of trust, and I can only imagine the surreal horror of hearing your own\nvoice saying things you never said, let alone cruel or objectionable speech.\n\n(Image credit: Nathan O. Marsh)\n\nI'm also of a mind with my coworker, PCG news writer Joshua Wolens, who last\nmonth wrote an ode to crappy mod scene voice acting, which seems particularly\nimperiled by the proliferation of cheap AI voice tools. Bad voice acting by\nreal humans at least has soul, and it opens you up to \"happy accidents\" as\nNeil Newbon called them in his Eurogamer interview.\n\nStill, I find myself vexed by one of my favorite games of last year: South\nScrimshaw Part One, a free visual novel presenting a Planet Earth-style\ndocumentary about alien whales on another planet. The art and writing is all\nreal, the creation of solo developer N.O. Marsh, who made South Scrimshaw\nwhile holding down a day job at a restaurant. However, Marsh used a generic AI\nvoice generator similar to what you'd find on TikTok to produce the game's\nnarration.\n\nWould South Scrimshaw benefit from a real, human performance instead?\nAbsolutely, but the even, emotionless delivery of the generated voice works\nsurprisingly well in a documentary context, the usage of synthesized voice\ntools is disclosed in the credits, and it all strikes me as a reasonable\ncompromise for a solo artist with a day job making a free game. South\nScrimshaw is, uncomfortably, an example of AI generation being deployed well\nto augment an artist's limited resources.\n\nTed Litchfield\n\nAssociate Editor\n\nTed has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen\nwith his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of\nNeverwinter Nights on the family computer. He is obsessed with all things CRPG\nand CRPG-adjacent, but has also covered esports, modding, and rare game\ncollecting. When he's not playing or writing about games, you can find Ted\nlifting weights on his back porch.\n\nMore about gaming industry\n\nGame studio owner suddenly lays everyone off and blames a Kotaku report that\nhasn't been published\n\nOne week after saying it was 'hard at work on our next project,' Immortals of\nAveum developer Ascendant Studios has reportedly furloughed most of its\nremaining staff\n\nLatest\n\nDiscord has banned two Switch emulator devs and shuttered their servers in the\nwake of Yuzu's defeat\n\nSee more latest \u25ba\n\nSee comments\n\n##### Most Popular\n\nMultiVersus fans have become convinced that the game is now slower, and they\nabsolutely hate it\n\n'Meet the computer addicts' with this BBC report from 1983 that makes my daily\nPC habits look pretty dire by comparison\n\nWoW's Pandaria Remix feels like it's emerged from an extended Pandaren brew\nsession in the dev room\n\nGTA 6 fans spend a week in Miami to painstakingly recreate the trailer shot-\nby-shot\u2014sans a certain bikini scene that would've cost $4,733\n\nAI is embedded in Intel's chipmaking process from 'front end silicon design,\nback end, software development, all the way to manufacturing'\n\nJapanese indie dev tells randoms begging for keys and offering exposure to\n'buy it, you piece of garbage'\n\nUbisoft is stripping people's licences for The Crew weeks after its shutdown,\nnearly squandering hopes of fan servers and acting as a stark reminder of how\nvolatile digital ownership is\n\nSSD prices will continue to rise thanks to high demand and 'supply chain\nchallenges' WD says\n\n'We try not to make it painful, except when it comes to skill': Remnant 2\ndesign leads talk adding player-driven QoL features, and the task of making a\nplayer-friendly soulslike\n\nJapanese cops bust interior decorator that moonlighted selling hacked Pok\u00e9mon:\n'I did it to make a living'\n\nAll Genshin Impact codes from the 4.6 livestream\n\nLoad Comments\n\n  1. 1\n\nBest ultrawide monitor for gaming in 2024: the expansive panels I recommend\nfor PC gamers\n\n  2. 2\n\nBest wireless gaming keyboard in 2024\n\n  3. 3\n\nBest gaming laptops in 2024: I've had my pick of portable powerhouses and\nthese are the best\n\n  4. 4\n\nBest gaming chairs in 2024: the seats I'd suggest for any gamer\n\n  5. 5\n\nBest graphics cards in 2024: the GPUs I recommend for every budget\n\n  1. 1\n\nInkbound review: A clever yet frustratingly muddled follow-up to Monster Train\n\n  2. 2\n\nAlienware 32 AW3225QF gaming monitor review\n\n  3. 3\n\nGlorious Model D 2 Pro 4K/8KHz Edition review\n\n  4. 4\n\nNextorage X Series (NN5PRO) 2TB review\n\n  5. 5\n\nScuf Envision Pro controller review\n\nPC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading\ndigital publisher.
