Due to models' extensive\n> reliance on fresh data, the operationalization of machine learning, or\n> MLOps, requires MLEs to have proficiency in data science and engineering.\n> When considered holistically, the job seems staggering -- how do MLEs do\n> MLOps, and what are their unaddressed challenges? To address these\n> questions, we conducted semi-structured ethnographic interviews with 18 MLEs\n> working on various applications, including chatbots, autonomous vehicles,\n> and finance. We find that MLEs engage in a workflow of (i) data preparation,\n> (ii) experimentation, (iii) evaluation throughout a multi-staged deployment,\n> and (iv) continual monitoring and response. Throughout this workflow, MLEs\n> collaborate extensively with data scientists, product stakeholders, and one\n> another, supplementing routine verbal exchanges with communication tools\n> ranging from Slack to organization-wide ticketing and reporting systems. We\n> introduce the 3Vs of MLOps: velocity, visibility, and versioning -- three\n> virtues of successful ML deployments that MLEs learn to balance and grow as\n> they mature. Finally, we discuss design implications and opportunities for\n> future work.\n\nComments:| arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.09125  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2403.16795 [cs.HC]  \n(or arXiv:2403.16795v1 [cs.HC] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.16795arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \nJournal reference:| Proc.
