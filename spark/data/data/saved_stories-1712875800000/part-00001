He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren.\nDuring this time of transition, his family asks that you please respect their\nwishes for privacy and grace.\u201d\n\nA statement from the Pro-Football Hall of Fame said Simpson, who died in Las\nVegas, had been receiving chemotherapy for prostate cancer, which it said he\nmade public two months ago.\n\nDavid Cook, an attorney for Goldman\u2019s family, said on Thursday in a brief\nstatement that Simpson \u201cdied without penance\u201d.\n\nOne of the most successful and popular sports stars of his generation,\nSimpson\u2019s career with the San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills, as well as\nhis post-retirement starring roles in Hollywood movies such as The Naked Gun,\nwas ultimately overshadowed by the 1994 murders and their aftermath.\n\nFrom a low-speed car chase across Los Angeles, broadcast live, in which\nSimpson attempted to flee pursuing police officers in a Ford Bronco, to the\ntelevised trial that captivated the attention of millions of viewers in the US\nand globally on a daily basis, the events heralded a blending of celebrity and\ncrime that has become a staple of media ever since.\n\nThe trial, which spread over 11 months, brought to prominence colorful\ncharacters including the judge Lance Ito, the attorneys Johnnie Cochran and\nRobert Kardashian, and the Simpsons\u2019 \u201chouse guest\u201d Kato Kaelin. It provided\nperhaps the most famous \u201cgotcha\u201d moment in courthouse history, when Simpson\nstruggled to put on a glove that the prosecution alleged he wore during the\nstabbings, and Cochran told the jury: \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit.\u201d\n\nThe proceedings also took place amid a backdrop of violent racial turmoil in\nLos Angeles, which only three years earlier had seen five days of rioting and\narson following the acquittal of several white police officers for severely\nbeating a Black motorist, Rodney King.\n\nMistrust of the LA police department by African-Americans in the city was\nrife, and detectives who testified in the Simpson trial were accused of\nracism. One, Mark Fuhrman, was infamously caught on tape, which was played to\nthe jury, using derogatory racist language, and talking about the planting of\nevidence.\n\nDetectives who took the stand spoke later about how they felt the jury was\n\u201cglaring\u201d at them, and that they believed \u201cthis case was never going to be\nwon\u201d following the King verdicts.\n\nDespite the not guilty verdict, three years after Simpson\u2019s criminal trial, he\nwas found liable in a civil suit brought by the victims\u2019 families and ordered\nto pay $33.5m. In 2008, he was sent to prison for 15 years for a botched\nrobbery in Las Vegas in which he attempted to forcibly recover sports\nmemorabilia he insisted had been stolen from him.\n\nSimpson led five men he barely knew into a confrontation with two memorabilia\ndealers in a hotel room. Two men with Simpson had guns. A jury convicted\nSimpson of armed robbery and other felonies.\n\nImprisoned at 61, he served nine years in a remote northern Nevada prison,\nincluding a stint as a gym janitor. He was not contrite when he was released\non parole in October 2017.\n\nIn later life, despite pledging to dedicate the rest of his life to the\nrelentless pursuit of those he insisted were the real killers, he declared\nbankruptcy and retired to Florida, where he became a regular on the golf\ncourse. Laws in the state protected his residence from seizure to settle his\ncivil case obligations, and he was accused of \u201cliving the high life\u201d in a\nmansion near to Miami.\n\nIn 2006, he also published the book If I Did It, in which he laid out how he\nwould have killed his ex-wife and her friend, had he been responsible for the\nmurders. Simpson described going to Brown\u2019s house carrying a knife, arguing\nwith her and then being shocked when Goldman appeared, in circumstances\nbroadly similar to those outlined by the prosecution.\n\nIn his story, Simpson claimed that he then \u201cblacked out\u201d, and regained\nconsciousness only to find two bloodied bodies. The book served only to\ncompound suspicions of Simpson\u2019s guilt.\n\nKim and Fred Goldman, the sister and father of Ron Goldman, spoke to the\nGuardian in 2017 about the frustration they experienced trying to recover\nmonetary damages from him. They said they were accused of being racist\nthemselves for not agreeing with the verdict.\n\n\u201cI get called all sorts of names \u2013 antisemitic, racist, sexual things. I\nignore most of it,\u201d Kim Goldman said, expressing frustration that Simpson\nmaintained a high public profile in the years following his acquittal.\n\n\u201cThere will still be people who will seek him out for pictures. He wasn\u2019t as\nostracized from society as I thought he would be.\u201d\n\nHer father agreed: \u201cThere was always someone who would play golf with him and\nthere still will be,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Thursday, Cook, their attorney, told the Associated Press that he had\nspoken with Ron Goldman about Simpson\u2019s death, and reiterated his intention to\ncontinue to pursue the civil judgment.\n\n\u201cHe died without penance. We don\u2019t know what he has, where it is or who is in\ncontrol. We will pick up where we are and keep going with it,\u201d he said.\n\nFascination with Simpson continued for decades after the trial. In 2016, the\nUS sports network ESPN broadcast a five-part documentary about his life, OJ:\nMade in America, which won an Academy award. The Guardian\u2019s review at the time\ncalled it a \u201ccaptivating and binge-worthy\u201d account of his success and\ndownfall.\n\nOrenthal James Simpson was born in in San Francisco and became one of the most\nfamous and well-liked football players of his day. He captured the Heisman\nTrophy while at USC, then played successfully for the 49ers and the Bills.\n\nBut his sports prowess played out alongside a burgeoning acting and media\ncareer that made him a huge celebrity \u2013 among both white and Black America.\n\nWhile still at USC, he appeared on Medical Center and then appeared in films\nsuch as The Klansman, The Cassandra Crossing and The Towering Inferno, as well\nas the miniseries Roots, \u2013 all while still a pro football player. After\nretiring from his beloved sport, he starred in three Naked Gun comedies.\n\nHe also appeared in commercials, notably for car rental company Hertz, and at\nthe time of the murders was arguably the most in-demand former sports star who\nhad made the switch into acting.\n\nSimpson leaves four living children, Arnelle and Jason, both aged in their\nfifties, from his first marriage to Marguerite Whitley; and Sydney, 38, and\nJustin, 35, with Brown. Aaren Simpson, whom he shared with Whitley, drowned in\nthe family swimming pool in 1979, weeks before her second birthday.\n\nSimpson was elected to the Pro-Football Hall of Fame in 1985, his first year\nof eligibility, the organization said in its statement.\n\n\u201cOJ Simpson was the first player to reach a rushing mark many thought could\nnot be attained in a 14-game season when he topped 2,000 yards,\u201d its\npresident, Jim Porter, said.\n\n  * Associated Press contributed reporting\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * OJ Simpson\n  * NFL\n  * US sports\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### OJ Simpson\u2019s life from NFL stardom to legal jeopardy \u2013 in pictures\n\n2h ago\n\n  * ### OJ Simpson a \u2018completely free man\u2019 after parole ends in Nevada\n\n14 Dec 2021\n\n  * ### OJ Simpson\u2019s Twitter debut sparks outrage and calls to action\n\n17 Jun 2019\n\n  * ### OJ Simpson seems to 'hypothetically' confess to murder in archive TV footage\n\n12 Mar 2018\n\n  * ### The Goldmans on their pursuit of OJ Simpson: \u2018We were called racist for not agreeing with the verdict\u2019\n\n24 Jul 2017\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### OJ Simpson: an eternal symbol of racial division \u2013 or has America moved on?\n\n1 Oct 2017\n\n  * ### OJ Simpson freed from prison after nine-year term for armed robbery\n\n1 Oct 2017\n\n  * ### Who Is America?: Sacha Baron Cohen tries to draw OJ Simpson confession\n\n27 Aug 2018\n\n  * ### OJ Simpson reveals how he would have killed his wife\n\n16 Nov 2006\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Soccer\n  * NFL\n  * Tennis\n  * MLB\n  * MLS\n  * NBA\n  * NHL\n  * F1\n  * Golf\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
