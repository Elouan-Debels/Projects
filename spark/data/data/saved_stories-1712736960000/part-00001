The Kobe University development provides a\nplatform for the industrial-scale, tunable production of a material that holds\ngreat potential for turning the plastic industry green.\n\nA fractured stick of lactic acid with added ultra-high molecular weight LAHB\n(left) exhibits obvious white discolorations at the fracture face, which is a\nsign of plastic deformation in toughened materials. On the other hand, pure\npolylactic acid (right) does not show such whitening, which is a sign of\nbrittle materials. \u00a9 KOH Sangho (CC BY)\n\nPlastic is a hallmark of our civilization. It is a family of highly formable\n(hence the name), versatile and durable materials, most of which are also\npersistent in nature and therefore a significant source of pollution.\nMoreover, many plastics are produced from crude oil, a non-renewable resource.\nEngineers and researchers worldwide are searching for alternatives, but none\nhave been found that exhibit the same advantages as conventional plastics\nwhile avoiding their problems. One of the most promising alternatives is\npolylactic acid, which can be produced from plants, but it is brittle and does\nnot degrade well.\n\nTo overcome these difficulties, Kobe University bioengineers around TAGUCHI\nSeiichi together with the biodegradable polymer manufacturing company Kaneka\nCorporation decided to mix polylactic acid with another bioplastic, called\nLAHB, which has a range of desirable properties, but most of all it is\nbiodegradable and mixes well with polylactic acid. However, in order to\nproduce LAHB, they needed to engineer a strain of bacteria that naturally\nproduces a precursor, by systematically manipulating the organism\u2019s genome\nthrough the addition of new genes and the deletion of interfering ones.\n\nIn the scientific journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering, they now\nreport that they could thus create a bacterial plastic factory that produces\nchains of LAHB in high amounts, using just glucose as feedstock. In addition,\nthey also show that by modifying the genome, they could control the length of\nthe LAHB chain and thus the properties of the resulting plastic. They were\nthus able to produce LAHB chains up to ten times longer than with conventional\nmethods, which they call \u201cultra-high molecular weight LAHB.\u201d\n\nMost importantly, by adding LAHB of this unprecedented length to polylactic\nacid, they could create a material that exhibits all the properties the\nresearchers had aimed for. The resulting highly transparent plastic is much\nbetter moldable and more shock resistant than pure polylactic acid, and also\nbiodegrades in seawater within a week. Taguchi comments on this achievement,\nsaying \u201cBy blending polylactic acid with LAHB, the multiple problems of\npolylactic acid can be overcome in one fell swoop, and the so modified\nmaterial is expected to become an environmentally sustainable bioplastic that\nsatisfies the conflicting needs of physical robustness and biodegradability.\u201d\n\nThe Kobe University bioengineers, however, dream bigger. The strain of\nbacteria they used in this work is in principle able to use CO_2 as a raw\nmaterial. It should thus be possible to synthesize useful plastics directly\nfrom the greenhouse gas. Taguchi explains, \u201cThrough the synergy of multiple\nprojects, we aim to realize a biomanufacturing technology that effectively\nlinks microbial production and material development.\u201d\n\nIndustrial manufacturing requires a high degree of melt tension, which can be\ndemonstrated by how little a material sags when being warmed up. LAHB-added\npolylactic acid (left) sags much less than pure polylactic acid (right),\nproving that it is a better processable material. \u00a9 KOH Sangho (CC BY)\n\nThe material resulting from adding ultra-high molecular weight LAHB to lactic\nis a highly transparent plastic: The circular disk is almost invisible in\nfront of a sheet of paper that has \u201cPLA/LAHB\u201d printed on it. \u00a9 KOH Sangho (CC\nBY)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis research was commissioned by the New Energy and Industrial Technology\nDevelopment Organization of Japan (grant JPNP20005) and funded by the Ministry\nof Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Japan (grant 19K22069)\nand the Japan Science and Technology Agency (grant JPMJTM19YC).
