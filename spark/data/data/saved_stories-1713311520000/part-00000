See\nalso my detailed instructions and finger illustrations starting from Step 8\n(below).\n\n### Step 1:\n\nBegin with a regular Left-over-Right Starting Knot.\n\n(See also illustration at Step 8)\n\n### Step 2:\n\nMake both ends into \u201cloops\u201d by simply doubling them back onto themselves.\n\n(See also illustration at Step 9)\n\n### Step 3:\n\nTwist both loops anti-clockwise so that the left (yellow) loose end is at the\nfront and the right (blue) loose end is at the back.\n\n(See also illustration at Step 10)\n\n### Step 4:\n\nCross the loops with the left (yellow) loose end in front.\n\nNOTE: The loops are really more \u201calongside\u201d each other, which is difficult to\nillustrate.\n\n(See also illustration at Step 11)\n\n### Step 5:\n\nEach hand uses the two fingers inside its own loop to grab the loose end of\nthe other hand's loop.\n\n(See also illustration at Step 12)\n\n### Step 6:\n\nEach hand releases its own loop and pulls the loose end of the opposite loop\nthrough its own.\n\n(See also illustration at Step 13)\n\n### Step 7:\n\nPull both loops tight to complete the knot.\n\n(See also illustration at Step 14)\n\n## Detailed Instructions\n\nThe following are detailed instructions and finger illustrations for my Ian\nKnot. See also my regular instructions and diagrams starting from Step 1\n(above).\n\n### Step 8:\n\nBegin with a regular Left-over-Right Starting Knot.\n\n(See also diagram at Step 1)\n\n### Step 9:\n\nHold the left (yellow) lace around the left thumb and forefinger, using the\nother fingers of the left hand to hold the lace taut. Hold the right (blue)\nlace between the right thumb and forefinger.\n\n(See also diagram at Step 2)\n\n### Step 10:\n\nThe left hand simply rotates forwards so that the left (yellow) loose end is\nat the front. The right middle finger pushes the right (blue) loose end to the\nback.\n\n(See also diagram at Step 3)\n\n### Step 11:\n\nThe left thumb pushes the left (yellow) loose end over to the right, while the\nright middle finger continues to push the right (blue) loose end all the way\nbetween the left thumb and forefinger to end up inside the left loop.\n\n(See also diagram at Step 4)\n\n### Step 12:\n\nThe left thumb and forefinger grab the right (blue) loose end, while the right\nthumb and middle finger grab the left (yellow) loose end.\n\n(See also diagram at Step 5)\n\n### Step 13:\n\nEach hand releases its own loop and pulls the loose end of the opposite loop\nthrough its own. Take care not to pull the ends all the way through, as this\nwill form a \u201cknot\u201d instead of a \u201cbow\u201d. In fact, this is a quick way to tie a\n\u201cStarting Knot\u201d (although the finger movements must be reversed left/right to\nbalance the finished knot).\n\n(See also diagram at Step 6)\n\n### Step 14:\n\nPull both loops tight to complete the knot. With practice, I can now tie my\nshoelaces in about one third of the time of a conventional knot!\n\n(See also diagram at Step 7)\n\nNOTE: You don't have to follow my instructions to the letter. So long as you\nretain the \u201ccore\u201d of the technique, you are welcome to use whatever finger\nmovements are most comfortable for you.\n\n## Finished Knot Gallery\n\nThe finished Ian Knot is identical to either the Standard Shoelace Knot or the\nTwo Loop Shoelace Knot. Because it was tied much more quickly and\nsymmetrically, the laces suffer less wear and tear and thus last longer.\n\nLast of five different lacing methods on Guy's shoes. One shoe is tied with an\nIan Knot, the other with an Ian's Secure Knot.\n\nShoes are tied off with Ian Knots, which Arto \u2013 a medical student \u2013 also uses\non surgical masks.\n\nPerfect pentagrams, finished off with perfect Ian Knots.\n\nThe right shoe has also been tied with an Ian Knot.\n\nHover over any image to view details\n\nClick any small image to enlarge\n\nContribute a photo (via e-mail)\n\nClose window\n\nNOTE: If your finished knot comes out crooked, it's probably because you tie\nyour Starting Knot the opposite way to mine. This will result in an un-\nbalanced \u201cGranny Knot\u201d, which sits crooked and comes undone more easily.
