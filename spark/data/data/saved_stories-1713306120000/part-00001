How would\nthey portray them in their paintings?\n\nImpossible to know, you say. Yes, but we can guess \u2013 thanks to AI!\n\nRecently I subscribed to the latest Stable Diffusion (impressive) and spent\nmany happy hours typing in prompts and admiring the results. One very\nproductive exercise is to take a subject S and an artist A and enter the\nprompt, \u201cpainting of S by A\u201d. Often the results are amazing.\n\nHere, for example, is one result of \u201cpainting of waterfall by Cezanne\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a nice picture of a waterfall, and it looks like a Cezanne. But it\u2019s not,\nCezanne never painted it. It\u2019s what\u2019s called a pastiche, a knock-off of\nCezanne.\n\nNevertheless I think the average reader would be unable to give an argument\nthat it\u2019s not a genuine if lesser-known Cezanne painting. Of course an expert\nwould be familiar with Cezanne\u2019s catalog and would realize this isn\u2019t in the\ncatalog. Maybe there are subtler clues but I don\u2019t see them.\n\nI\u2019ve generated hundreds of pastiches and on the whole I love them \u2013 some are\nbrilliant (your mileage may vary).\n\nBut now we\u2019re in a position to guess the approaches of the old (and no so old)\nmasters, To get an idea of what computers mean to Rembrandt, I typed \u201cpainting\nof a computer by Rembrandt\u201d and got\n\nImage by author via stable diffusion\n\nDefinitely Rembrandt-like but the computer? He\u2019s not a fan.\n\nPicasso is (after Rembrandt perhaps) the world\u2019s most famous painter. The\nprompt \u201cpainting of a computer by Picasso\u201d yielded\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nOf course Picasso is not exactly an old master \u2013 he died in 1972, scarcely 10\nyears before the first Macintosh. But I\u2019m sure he had no experience with\ncomputers in his lifetime.\n\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned Cezanne, here\u2019s what we get\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nAt least the mouse is modern.\n\nAndy Warhol lived to see computers. Here\u2019s the pastiche\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nTalk about self-promotion!\n\nJackson Pollock is famous for this abstract paintings \u2013 he literally poured\npaint on the canvasses. What would he make of computers? The pastiche:\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nThe paint dripping off the computer is a nice touch\n\nBy trial and error I produced a list of artists who reliably produced good\npastiches. The list includes Picasso, Klee, Klimt, Cezanne, Matisse, Mondrian,\nModigliani, Van Gogh, Caravaggio. Let\u2019s look at a couple more.\n\nVan Gogh:\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nMatisse:\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nKandinsky:\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nAnd my favourite artist, a real Old Master, Caravaggio (1571-1610):\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nThe iPhone\n\nYou\u2019ve undoubtedly noticed that the \u201ccomputers\u201d in these pastiches are 80\u2019s or\n90\u2019s vintage. I don\u2019t know why \u2013 maybe the age of the training data. Let\u2019s\nforce it up to date by asking about iPhones.\n\nMy first result was intriguing, I prompted \u201ciPhone by Modigliani\u201d and got\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nAt first sight, a typical Modigliani portrait. But look at her right hand and\nright ear ...\n\nNext, Toulouse Lautrec:\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nYep, an iPhone!\n\nHere\u2019s Picasso:\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nGauguin:\n\nStable Diffusion\n\nKlimt:\n\nStable Diffusion\n\n(Stable Diffusion\u2019s not too good with text.)\n\nAnd again, my favourite, Caravaggio:\n\nStable Diffusion\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * X\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nGOFAI is dead \u2013 long live (NF) AI!
