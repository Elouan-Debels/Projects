Print\nCollector / Getty Images\n\nColumns\n\nSee More\n\nOn an unseasonably cold day in late March, I took a nearly empty ferry to\nGovernor\u2019s Island in New York Harbor. The sun was shining, but a brutal,\nfrigid wind meant it was hardly a day for a picnic, a popular reason to visit\nthe island in the summer. I disembarked onto a nearly deserted island, one\nthat would have been utterly quiet if not for the near-constant sound of\nprivate helicopters taking off from and landing on the lower tip of Manhattan.\nI was there to see the star-shaped Fort Jay, a coastal defense built between\n1794 and 1806, one of a series of fortifications that once protected the city\nand its harbor, and recently recast as a historic monument and spot for summer\nrecreation. It\u2019s notable for its striking structure\u2014a kind of five-pointed\nstar, a shape that has led to its inclusion in a strange conspiracy theory\nabout the nature of the past and humanity itself.\n\nThe evolution of European-style fortresses from square with rounded turrets at\nthe corners to pointed bastions like the ones on Fort Jay was a result of\nsimple geometry and technological progress. While the traditional structures\ncould easily be defended by archers, those same turrets created blind spots\nfor cannons, which could not be maneuvered as easily or fired directly\ndownward from the top of a battlement. The pointed bastions solved this\nproblem by eliminating blind spots: Cannons could be placed at the wide end of\na bastion, and pointed down along the long line of the adjacent walls to\ndefend against armies attacking from any direction.\n\nATLAS OBSCURA COURSES\n\nLearn with Us!\n\nCheck out our lineup of courses taught by world-class experts from around the\nworld. See Courses\n\nI first began thinking seriously about bastion forts after reading W.G.\nSebald\u2019s final novel, Austerlitz. The book centers around the eponymous\narchitecture critic, Jacques Austerlitz, who explains to the protagonist early\non that \u201cit is often our mightiest projects that most obviously betray the\ndegree of our insecurity.\u201d Describing the evolution of bastion forts\nthroughout Europe, Austerlitz describes how they betray a \u201cfundamentally\nwrong-headed idea: the notion that by designing an ideal trace with blunt\nbastions and ravelins projecting well beyond it, allowing the cannon of the\nfortress to cover the entire operational area outside the walls, you could\nmake a city as secure as anything in the world can ever be.\u201d\n\nLike many historic defense structures, Fort Jay is now obsolete, sitting on an\nisland more popular as a picnic destination. B.O\u2019Kane / Alamy\n\n\u201cNo one today,\u201d he continues, \u201chas the faintest idea of the boundless amount\nof theoretical writings on the building of fortifications, of the fantastical\nnature of the geometric, trigonometric, and logistical calculations they\nrecord, of the inflated excesses of the professional vocabulary of\nfortification and siegecraft, no one now understands its simplest terms,\nescarpe and courtine, faussebraie, r\u00e9duit, and glacis, yet even from our\npresent standpoint we can see that towards the end of the seventeenth century\nthe star-shaped dodecagon behind trenches had finally crystallized, out of the\nvarious available systems, as the preferred ground plan.\u201d Fort Jay has only\nfive points\u2014a much-simplified version of the plan Austerlitz describes\u2014but\nFort Wood, just across the harbor on what was then called Beldoe\u2019s Island, has\na full 11 points. It was completed around the same time as Fort Jay, but it\nhas since been converted into the base of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThere are hundreds of these structures still standing today; they can be found\neverywhere from Antigua to Taiwan and from Ireland to Venezuela, though the\nvast majority of them are in Europe (there are dozens still standing in France\nalone, and nearly as many in Italy) and in former European colonies (the East\nCoast of the United States has dozens from Maine to Florida, and five dot the\ncoast of Ghana, remnants of the Dutch and Portuguese occupations). They were\nfirst developed after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, and became\nwidespread throughout the 16th century, until their gradual obsolescence\nbecame apparent in the 1800s.\n\nAs massive structures meant to withstand direct hits from cannon fire, they\u2019re\nformidable and not easily removed, and they\u2019ve lingered in the landscape long\nafter they ceased to have any use. What lies behind these structures, then, is\na fully accessible but bizarrely complex archive of architecture and military\nhistory, but one that has lost all utility or interest, even as the structures\nthemselves persist. We are doomed, it would seem, to be surrounded not just by\nstructures that not only outlast us, but whose very nature eludes and\nconfounds us.\n\nThe star-shaped dodecagon had, Austerlitz notes, \u201cfinally crystallized, out of\nthe various available systems, as the preferred ground plan\u201d in the 17th\ncentury. DEA / ICAS94 / Getty Images\n\nI returned to Sebald\u2019s novel again as I learned that there is an entire\nconspiracy theory built around these fortifications. According to the stranger\ncorners of the Internet, these forts are not elaborate remnants of long-\nobsolete defense strategies, but rather structures built by some lost, hyper-\nadvanced civilization. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear from the outset,\u201d the website\nstarforts.org states, \u201cthe starforts that remain today, either intact or in\nruins, were part of a far larger network of a lost civilisation [sic] that\nspanned pretty much\u2014as far as we can tell\u2014the entire Earth. This is a bold\nclaim, but there is a growing body of evidence to support such a claim.\nResearch is ongoing.\u201d The various fortifications of various countries engaged\nin various hostilities have been linked together, their lingering presence\ntaken as evidence of some vanished empire.\n\nLittered all through Youtube, TikTok, and Reddit are videos and threads with\nnames like \u201cStar Forts: Tesla Technology, Vibration Healing, Ancient\nElectricity, Sound Frequency Technology,\u201d in which bastion forts are recast as\nkey players in the New Age gobbledygook that makes up so much of social media\nthese days. (Among the regular posters in the starforts.org thread is a man\nnamed John A. Warner IV, the son of former U.S. Senator and U.S. Secretary of\nthe Navy John Warner III, who\u2019s self-published a novel that involves star\nforts, among its many other plots, and argued, for example, that they were not\nbuilt but rather \u201cgrown\u201d through some combination of frequency resonance and\n\u201cwater cymatics,\u201d whatever that is.) What unites these various strands of\nconspiracy is that the star forts are somehow capable of harnessing\nelectromagnetic energy through their structure, and that they thus act, in\nsome sense, as free energy generators. The star pattern, these conspiracists\nallege, mimics certain frequency waves as they appear on oscilloscopes,\nsuggesting that these structures\u2019 design reflects not military technology but\nan organic shape that somehow harmonizes with the natural world.\n\n> By (falsely) recasting these fortresses as ancient power generators, they\n> wipe away the long history of war and strife they actually represent.\n\nIf this makes little sense to you, don\u2019t worry; even the most cogent and\ndirect articulation of the theory is bizarre, contradictory, and relies on\nquestion-begging and obfuscation. As with many conspiracy theories, the Star\nForts hypothesis depends on a willful, obtuse misreading of evidence. \u201cStar\nForts are all over the world but nobody can really explain them,\u201d reads one\npost on X; another conspiracist explains in a video, \u201cI\u2019ve looked at star\nforts, folks, and they just don\u2019t cut the mustard with regards to \u2018this a\ndefensive building,\u2019 they\u2019re just not defensible. I mean yeah you can defend\nthem, and you could fortify them, but they couldn\u2019t have been built for that\npurpose, when you look at them, it just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d In another, Fort\nPrince of Wales, a remote bastion fort in northern Manitoba, is singled out\nfor, at some point in its history, having been repointed (\u201cthe only reasoning\none can deduce is that the mortar is nothing more than cosmetic\u201d), one of a\nseries of very obvious elements of the building\u2019s past that are held up as\ninscrutable mysteries, before the vlogger concludes: \u201cThis building was found,\nrather than built.\u201d\n\nWhy this strange obsession with proving that these defunct structures hold a\ndeeper meaning? As secret power generators, so the story goes, they once held\nthe key to free energy; if we could awaken them, we could not only be free of\nfossil fuels, but we could end war and poverty. That is why, according to\nthese conspiracists, their true nature has been hidden from us. The star forts\nmythos is a further elaboration on the various conspiracy theories involving\nnuclear fusion, the water-fueled carburetor, Nikola Tesla\u2019s perpetual motion\nmachines. It alleges that a secret global cabal is responsible for the strife,\nsuffering, and deprivation of the modern world\u2014and that the answer to all our\nproblems is hiding in plain sight.\n\nOne vlogger\u2019s theory on Manitoba\u2019s Fort Prince of Wales: \u201cThis building was\nfound, rather than built.\u201d Paul Souders / Alamy\n\nNone of this is, in itself, particularly new. At least since Erich von\nD\u00e4niken\u2019s Chariots of the Gods? was published in 1968 (the question mark was\nlater dropped from the title), revisionist history has long postulated that\ngreat and unusual structures are the work of aliens. The star forts theory\ncomes from the same playbook, just with a focus on well-documented, modern\nfortifications rather than, say, the Pyramids. Beliefs about pre-European\ncivilizations being the work of extraterrestrials is a long-standing trope\nthat reeks of Western chauvinism and racism\u2014a way to discount the art and\narchitecture of the Egyptians or the Maya, or the math and perspective that\nthe ancient Nazca culture of Peru used to lay out the massive figures of the\nNazca Lines.\n\nWhat\u2019s stranger about the star fort conspiracy theory, then, is that it\nestranges Westerners from their own culture\u2014these are not buildings\nconstructed thousands of years ago and left in ruins, but were made by the\nconspiracists\u2019 own ancestors, and explained in great detail in writing that is\neasily accessible to readers of English, French, and German. Any sense of\nmystery here is entirely, willfully manufactured.\n\nPerhaps this is why I felt compelled to go back to Fort Jay, the nearest\nextant bastion fort to where I live in Brooklyn. It lies just off the ferry\nterminal, down a road that ascends to the mound that the fort was dug into.\nBecause it\u2019s largely sunken into the ground, it\u2019s far from imposing and barely\nrises above the landscape. You have to crest the hill to get a sense of it,\nthough even then you\u2019re not nearly high enough to see the whole plan at once.\nInstead you have to walk its perimeter.\n\nThe deep moat separating the fort from the surrounding hill remains, and\nthough the grass is tended, it still evokes a sense of distant ruins, with\nearth and grass everywhere coming up to\u2014and in some cases covering\u2014the stone\nbattlements now 200 years old. As a National Park site, there are small\nplacards at key places explaining its history, but they give little detail. Of\nthe building\u2019s shape, they state only that it \u201cwas commonly used in\nfortifications because it gave defenders effective angles of fire.\u201d\n\nSome conspiracists believe the Nazca Lines of Peru to be the work of aliens\ninstead of the ancient Nazca culture. Max Shen / Getty Images\n\nOne of the features of a fortification like this is that it\u2019s impossible to\ntake it all in at once. Rather than an imposing fa\u00e7ade like a cathedral or a\ncastle, Fort Jay presents as a series of long, squat brick and stone walls, in\nmultiple directions, with acute zigzags in trajectory. At no point does it\nsuggest its star shape; it doesn\u2019t suggest any kind of shape at all. It feels\nhaphazard, if implacable. Only when you look at a ground plan do you see the\noverall shape.\n\nIn my periphery, across the harbor, was the rebuilt World Trade Center, a\nvague reminder of the precarity of the country\u2019s security. It was strange to\nsee a fortification like this in 21st-century America, which hasn\u2019t been\nformally invaded in centuries. In Sebald\u2019s Austerlitz, such buildings are less\nevidence of powerful defense than of a specific form of madness. For, as\nAusterlitz points out, there is an obvious flaw in these designs: \u201ca tendency\ntowards paranoid elaboration,\u201d he explains, ends up drawing \u201cattention to your\nweakest point, practically inviting your enemy to attack it, not to mention\nthe fact that as architectural plans for fortifications became increasingly\ncomplex, the time it took to build them increased as well, and with it the\nprobability that as soon as they were finished, if not before, they would have\nbeen overtaken by further developments, both in artillery and in strategic\nplanning, which took account of the growing realization that everything was\ndecided in movement, not in a state of rest.\u201d\n\nThe ruins that surround us, he suggests, are not always the result of clever\nplanning, thoughtful foresight, or a measured desire for peace or even\nlegacy\u2014but rather they are themselves manifestations of the workings of\nparanoid minds. The same way a thought or sentence or conversation might spin\nout of control, so too can a wall of brick and mortar. So it might seem we\nremain surrounded by legacies of paranoia, onto which we project our own\nparanoias. \u201cAt the most,\u201d Austerlitz explains elsewhere, we gaze at such\nstructures \u201cin wonder, a kind of wonder which in itself is a form of dawning\nhorror, for somehow we know by instinct that outsize buildings cast the shadow\nof their own destruction before them, and are designed from the first with an\neye to their later existence as ruins.\u201d\n\n> We gaze at such structures in \u201cwonder, a kind of wonder which in itself is a\n> form of dawning horror.\u201d\n\nBut paranoia, mediated by architecture, does not always beget paranoia\u2014at\nleast not entirely. For me, the main affective emotion generated by the star\nforts conspiracies is a kind of melancholy. There seems to be, hidden among\nall the strange explanations and justifications, a bizarrely utopian aspect to\nthis particular conspiracy theory. As one person wrote in the starforts.org\nforums, \u201cThe starciv phenomenon gives me hope. It shows that a worldwide\nsociety has existed that could work together to make the world a beautiful\nplace, working with nature\u2014and guaranteeing the best future possible for\neveryone. It is possible, because it has already existed. The world hasn\u2019t\nalways been at war\u2014the starciv is the proof of that.\u201d By (falsely) recasting\nthese fortresses as ancient power generators, they wipe away the long history\nof war and strife they actually represent.\n\nSuch thoughts, however hopeful, require the active destruction of historical\nmemory, and sustaining such a wide-ranging theory requires so much of it.\nEverything needs to be reduced to the level of Egyptian hieroglyphics\u2014a\ndistant, purportedly unreadable text (of course, we can read hieroglyphics)\nthat can be re-interpreted by amateurs at will.\n\nFort Wood, an 11-pointed defense structure built between 1808 and 1811, is now\nthe base of the Statue of Liberty. Jamie Lorriman / Alamy\n\nPerhaps Sebald was right in supposing that such massive projects betray a deep\ninsecurity, and that despite their thorough construction of brick and stone,\nthey already prefigure and imagine their own destruction. But that\ndestruction, it seems, comes not from artillery or the wrecking ball, but from\nthe obliteration of the past that could give such places context and meaning.\n\nI see human history as one involving\u2014yes\u2014pain, strife, catastrophe, and folly,\nbut also the potential for strange grandeur, unexpected beauty, and the\nperseverance of justice even in times of great darkness. I see a past that is\ncomplicated but wondrous, filled with disorder and chaos but never without\nmoments of redemption. Conspiracists, on the other hand, want to reimagine the\nfuture by destroying any sense we have of the past.\n\nI once stood at the foot of such battlements and experienced a kind of sublime\nawe, a sense of the weight of history, compacted. Now I\u2019m more often likely to\nfeel a kind of anxiety. Whereas the conspiracists are estranged from the past\nand the architectural world around them, I feel estranged from them and my\nfellow human community. We stare at the same building and see two entirely\ndifferent things.\n\nColin Dickey is the author of five books of nonfiction, including Ghostland:\nAn American History in Haunted Places, and, most recently, Under the Eye of\nPower: How Fear of Secret Societies Shapes American Democracy.
