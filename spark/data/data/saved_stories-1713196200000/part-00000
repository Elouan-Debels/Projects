Most\npeople start and after a few days they get impostor syndrome. Believing, that\nlearning to code is impossible.\n\nHow would I learn to code if I started again? What techniques I followed back\nin the day?\n\n### Have a plan.\n\nKnowing what to study is crucial. Before starting, I researched and decided to\nlearn Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js to become a full-stack developer.\n\nYou'll need about 300-500 hours of project building and studying to be job-\nready.

However,\nconsistency is crucial. You need to reach the 300-500 hour benchmark to be\nprepared and create 1-2 free websites to have something to showcase on your\nCV.\n\nSo here is a list of the steps you should follow.\n\n  1.
