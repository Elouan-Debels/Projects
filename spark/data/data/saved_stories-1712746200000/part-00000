The\ngovernment can celebrate the achievements of Chinese tech companies one day\nand then turn against them the next.\n\nBut there are patterns in how China approaches regulating tech, argues Angela\nHuyue Zhang, a law professor at Hong Kong University and author of the new\nbook High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy. The way\nChinese policies change almost always follow a three-phase progression: a lax\napproach where companies are given relative flexibility to expand and compete,\nsudden harsh crackdowns that slash profits, and eventually a new loosening of\nrestrictions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake Alibaba and Tencent as examples. Since the 2000s, the two tech giants\nhave made hundreds of mergers and investments, as a result of which their\nbusiness empires expanded to include almost every aspect of digital life in\nChina. This insatiable expansion came at the expense of users, who faced\nhigher prices and less choice, but Chinese regulators let it slide. Then,\nsuddenly, the government started a tech crackdown in 2020. All of a sudden,\npast mergers and acquisitions were under investigation, and hefty fines were\nmeted out to punish the companies for antitrust violations, including a $2.8\nbillion fine for Alibaba.\n\nMIT Technology Review recently spoke with Zhang about her new book and how to\napply her insights to China\u2019s tech industry, including significant new sectors\nlike artificial intelligence.\n\n### The pendulum swing\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this saying I also cited in my book: \u4e00\u653e\u5c31\u4e71, \u4e00\u6293\u5c31\u6b7b (loosening causes\nchaos; tightening up causes death),\u201d Zhang says. The Chinese expression\nperfectly captures how the regulators dramatically yet predictably oscillate\nbetween doing too little to police the tech sector and doing too much.\n\nIn the book, Zhang argues that Chinese tech platforms have long been accused\nof obstructing competition, infringing on privacy, and violating the labor\nrights of gig workers\u2014but regulators accommodated them in all three areas\nuntil suddenly putting the companies under scrutiny in late 2020. And after\nthe peak of enforcement in 2022, the regulators slowed down on all three\nfronts and reached a compromise with Chinese companies.\n\nOutside the examples in the book, \u201cI think [the pattern] fits almost every\nsector,\u201d Zhang says. From financial innovations like peer-to-peer loans in the\nmid-2010s to online tutoring, which exploded in popularity during the\npandemic, they all went through similar shifts in experience with the\nregulators.\n\n### The government can be a helping hand\n\nWestern observers of Chinese policies often focus on the crackdown phase.\nHistorically, it\u2019s involved some dramatic moments\u2014for example, the government\nforcing the ride-hail giant Didi to delist from the New York Stock Exchange or\nslapping antitrust fines on Alibaba after its former head, Jack Ma, made a\npublic speech against regulation.\n\nBut Zhang warns that these high-profile crackdowns mask the symbiotic\nrelationship between tech companies and the government. \u201cWe tend to see\n[Chinese tech regulations] as very predatory,\u201d she says, but \u201cregulations\nactually give a helping hand to these firms.\u201d\n\nCOURTESY OF ANGELA HUYUE ZHANG\n\nFor many government officials, especially at the provincial and local levels,\ntech companies are the most important contributors to tax revenues and\nemployment. They are often referred to as \u201clocal champions\u201d or \u201clittle\ngiants,\u201d and their business interests are directly tied to the interests of\nlocal governments. In turn, the governments often go to great lengths to\nprotect these companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZhang found, for example, that Chinese local courts spend tremendous judicial\nresources helping tech firms resolve online disputes. In a six-year span from\n2016 to 2021, three local courts in the southern city of Guangzhou processed\nover 130,000 cases where the Chinese fintech company Lakala sued its users for\ndefaulting on microloans. At one of the courts, each judge on average ruled on\nabout 1,400 Lakala disputes in 2019 or 2020, meaning the court was essentially\nturned into an outsourced dispute arbitrator for the company. And the result?\nLakala won almost all the cases.\n\n### When interests align on AI\n\nCurrently, AI is making the case that the interests of the government and the\nChinese companies are aligned even more closely.\n\nThat\u2019s because the technology is seen as crucial to achieving China\u2019s goals of\ntechnological supremacy and self-sufficiency, Zhang says.\n\nDuring China\u2019s post-2008 economic slump, consumer tech startups and the\nplatform economy were seen as a way to inspire new growth; the same is\nhappening with AI today. At China\u2019s annual parliamentary meeting last month,\nPresident Xi Jinping coined the term \u201cnew quality productive forces,\u201d meaning\nthe new sectors that are expected to counter China\u2019s current economic\nslowdown. And a campaign focused on AI was explicitly mentioned in this\nconnection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a business that the Chinese government is deeply involved in from the\nstart,\u201d Zhang says. The Chinese government has taken multiple roles in the\ndevelopment of AI, functioning as policy maker, incubator, investor in AI\nstartups, supplier of research, customer of AI applications, and more. \u201cAnd\nnow behind every successful Chinese AI firm, there is a local government,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cThat powerful backing will offer more political protection for Chinese\nAI businesses.\u201d\n\n### The AI honeymoon phase today\n\nThe government\u2019s deeply embedded interest in China\u2019s AI industry means that\nthe industry will stay in that initial phase of lax regulation for a while,\nZhang says. And she argues that AI regulations in China today are looser than\nthose in the US and Europe.\n\nThis claim may seem a little counterintuitive at first. While the EU has\nindeed led the world in passing AI regulation, China has reacted much more\nswiftly than the US, including passing some sweeping regulations about\ngenerative AI, deepfakes, and recommendation algorithms in the past two years.\n\nBut Zhang believes that these regulations are strict only when it comes to\nfreedom of speech and content control, areas in which the Chinese government\nhas been increasingly stringent. Other than that, the recent regulations offer\nvague principles and few enforceable measures to prevent the AI from causing\nharm, including harm to Chinese people\u2019s human rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), an internet regulator that has a\nclose relationship with the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda bureau, has been in\ncharge of reducing the risk that generative AI models will produce politically\ndamaging content. Some of its restrictive measures, like requiring language\nmodels to reflect socialist values and asking for real-identity verification\nfor users, will no doubt make it harder for Chinese companies to innovate and\ncompete. But the CAC\u2019s work often clashes with the priorities of other Chinese\ngovernment agencies like the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology,\nwhich are more focused on boosting China\u2019s technology capabilities.\n\nJudging from Chinese AI regulations so far, the pro-growth faction has\nprevailed, says Zhang. \u201cAt least you [in the US] have the FTC open an\ninvestigation into OpenAI. In China, did you see the CAC open an investigation\ninto Baidu or ByteDance? No. And I predict they are very unlikely to do that\nin the future, unless something really bad happens,\u201d she says.\n\nHow bad would it have to be to trigger the switch to regulatory crackdown?\nZhang says it would take a big AI misuse that sets off wide-ranging\ncontroversies and threatens social stability. If that happens, then the\nChinese regulatory pendulum will dutifully swing to the harsh side again.\n\nWhen it happens, it will be quick. \u201cIt will be quite random and quite sudden,\u201d\nZhang says, \u201cand it will be a surprise.\u201d\n\n### by Zeyi Yang\n\n### Share\n\n  * Share story on linkedin\n\n  * Share story on twitter\n\n  * Share story on facebook\n\n  * Share story on email\n\n  * ### Popular\n\n    1.
