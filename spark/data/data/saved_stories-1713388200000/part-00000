These damages are\nsix times larger than the mitigation costs needed to limit global warming to\ntwo degrees.\n\nBased on empirical data from more than 1,600 regions worldwide over the past\n40 years, scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research\n(PIK) assessed future impacts of changing climatic conditions on economic\ngrowth and their persistence.\n\n\"Strong income reductions are projected for the majority of regions, including\nNorth America and Europe, with South Asia and Africa being most strongly\naffected. These are caused by the impact of climate change on various aspects\nthat are relevant for economic growth such as agricultural yields, labor\nproductivity or infrastructure,\" says PIK scientist and first author of the\nstudy Maximilian Kotz.\n\nOverall, global annual damages are estimated to be at 38 trillion dollars,\nwith a likely range of 19\u201359 trillion dollars in 2050. These damages mainly\nresult from rising temperatures but also from changes in rainfall and\ntemperature variability. Accounting for other weather extremes such as storms\nor wildfires could further raise them.\n\n## Huge economic costs also for the United States and European Union\n\n\"Our analysis shows that climate change will cause massive economic damages\nwithin the next 25 years in almost all countries around the world, also in\nhighly-developed ones such as Germany, France and the United States,\" says PIK\nscientist Leonie Wenz who led the study.\n\n\"These near-term damages are a result of our past emissions. We will need more\nadaptation efforts if we want to avoid at least some of them. And we have to\ncut down our emissions drastically and immediately\u2014if not, economic losses\nwill become even bigger in the second half of the century, amounting to up to\n60% on global average by 2100. This clearly shows that protecting our climate\nis much cheaper than not doing so, and that is without even considering non-\neconomic impacts such as loss of life or biodiversity.\"\n\nTo date, global projections of economic damages caused by climate change\ntypically focus on national impacts from average annual temperatures over\nlong-time horizons.\n\nBy including the latest empirical findings from climate impacts on economic\ngrowth in more than 1,600 subnational regions worldwide over the past 40 years\nand by focusing on the next 26 years, the researchers were able to project\nsub-national damages from temperature and rainfall changes in great detail\nacross time and space all the while reducing the large uncertainties\nassociated with long-term projections.\n\nThe scientists combined empirical models with state-of-the-art climate\nsimulations (CMIP-6). Importantly, they also assessed how persistently climate\nimpacts have affected the economy in the past and took this into account as\nwell.\n\n## Countries least responsible will suffer most\n\n\"Our study highlights the considerable inequity of climate impacts: We find\ndamages almost everywhere, but countries in the tropics will suffer the most\nbecause they are already warmer. Further temperature increases will therefore\nbe most harmful there. The countries least responsible for climate change, are\npredicted to suffer income loss that is 60% greater than the higher-income\ncountries and 40% greater than higher-emission countries,\" says Anders\nLevermann, Head of Research Department Complexity Science at the Potsdam\nInstitute and co-author of the study.\n\n\"They are also the ones with the least resources to adapt to its impacts. It\nis on us to decide: structural change towards a renewable energy system is\nneeded for our security and will save us money. Staying on the path we are\ncurrently on, will lead to catastrophic consequences. The temperature of the\nplanet can only be stabilized if we stop burning oil, gas and coal.\"\n\nMore information: Leonie Wenz, The economic commitment of climate change,\nNature (2024).
