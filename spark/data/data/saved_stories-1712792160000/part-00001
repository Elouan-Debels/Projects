The labels are required for both wired and\nwireless services, and must be displayed at physical stores and online. A link\nto the rule sheet isn't sufficient \u2013 it has to actually be visible.\n\n\"These 'nutrition label' disclosures are designed to make it simpler for\nconsumers to know what they are getting, hold providers to their promises, and\nbenefit from greater competition \u2013 which means better service and prices for\neveryone,\" FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said.\n\nA sample of the new FCC broadband labels required to be displayed at points of\nsale \u2013 click for PDF\n\nThe rules only apply to the largest ISPs for now but by October 10 they will\nexpand to include smaller regional providers with less than 100,000 customers\nas well.\n\nAlong with the October addition of smaller providers, additional rules come\ninto effect that month requiring the labels to be machine-readable \"to enable\nthird parties to more easily collect and aggregate data for the purpose of\ncreating comparison-shopping tools,\" the FCC said.\n\n### Didn't we do this already?\n\nIf you're getting a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu over this broadband labeling thing,\nyou're not losing your mind.\n\nThe FCC launched a similar program back in 2016 that included very similar\nlabels for broadband service under the agency's net neutrality authority, but\nthe program had limited success.\n\nISPs weren't actually required to display the labels launched in 2016, the FCC\nsaid, but this time it's not optional.\n\nThe rule requiring labeling of broadband services is also detached from net\nneutrality, as it was passed after the Trump-era FCC scrapped the regulations\nin 2017. Along with its second attempt at getting broadband labels to stick,\nthe FCC is also set to vote later this month to reinstate net neutrality\nrules.\n\n  * America's broadband bill subsidy runs out of money and halts enrollments\n  * G7 countries beat UK in worldwide broadband speed test again\n  * Feds finally decide to do something about years-old SS7 spy holes in phone networks\n  * FCC throws an $18B bone to rural broadband\n\nInternet service in the US is notoriously poor and pricy, and what qualifies\nas broadband has classically been quite low \u2013 just 25 Mbps for downloads and 3\nMbps for uploads. The FCC has also been busy updating those standards, and\nrecently upped the benchmark for what qualifies as broadband service in the US\nto 100 Mbps down and 20 Mbps up after years discussing the matter.\n\nThe previous broadband benchmark was established in 2015, along with the open\ninternet rules that established net neutrality and the previous ill-fated\nattempt at ISP labeling. \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Broadband\n  * FCC\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Broadband\n  * FCC\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Comcast\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Network\n\n#### More about\n\nPOST A COMMENT\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Broadband\n  * FCC\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Broadband\n  * FCC\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Comcast\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Network\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### FCC to reinstate net neutrality in the US until someone decides to scrap\nit again\n\nPendulum returns to the Obama era \u2013 don't be surprised if it swings right back\n\nNetworks7 days | 19\n\n#### Feds finally decide to do something about years-old SS7 spy holes in\nphone networks\n\nAnd Diameter, too, for good measure\n\nNetworks8 days | 22\n\n#### Stuck paying for your apartment's crummy internet?
