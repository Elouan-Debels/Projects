This provided over a hundred billion dollars in subsidies\nfor building massive, expensive chip fabs inside the US to handle increased\ndemand and increase national security. It was supposed to result in investment\nof hundreds of billions of dollars in the US as well as create a hundred\nthousand jobs.\n\nThanks for reading Innovation Nation!

Well, DEI of course.\n\nSee, in order to gain access to the subsidies, everything from the\nconstruction workers, to suppliers, to engineers, and finally fab workers need\nto meet stringent government DEI requirements.\n\nFor instance, 40% of construction workers need to be female. Except only 10%\nof all construction workers are women currently. Additionally, chip makers\nmust provide fully paid for childcare and healthcare for everyone involved\nincluding construction workers. Obviously, this skyrockets the price of\neverything from the moment they break ground. Of course, the quotas for\nminority workers are there too.\n\nThe issue is these fab facilities are basically the most advanced factories in\nthe world. It\u2019s not like anyone can be employed at them. These are not Amazon\nwarehouses. Fab workers frequently make well into the six figures and have\nmaster\u2019s degrees in engineering. In fact, during construction on one fab, TSMC\nhad so much difficulty finding local talent, they flew in 500 Taiwanese\nengineers which angered the federal government and local authorities.\n\nSo guess what they did? They stopped construction. Intel and Samsung have also\nsimilarly ceased construction on their fabs and reallocated capital to fabs in\nIsrael, Europe, and Asia. Currently only one fab is being under active\nconstruction in the US despite the aforementioned hundred billion dollars\navailable to subsidize construction.\n\nWhy? Because the federal government shoves stupid requirements down the\nthroats of companies that dramatically increase cost and time to production.\nAll in the name of DEI.\n\nI\u2019m not entirely against some form of DEI and certainly believe everyone\nshould be given the same opportunities, but in specialized fields or fields\nthat don\u2019t appeal to certain people there simply aren\u2019t enough qualified\napplicants to fulfill most DEI requirements. Not to mention the additional\ncosts such as providing childcare. DEI requirements don\u2019t work if the people\nyou need to hire literally don\u2019t exist, which they most certainly do not in\nthis case.\n\nI heard a fascinating story from a friend who ran a division at Intel a few\nyears ago. This was a highly specialized field which just happened to be\ndominated by white men. It was also crucial to Intel\u2019s future plans.\n\nExcept Intel famously had very strict DEI quotas and requirements. They made\nno secret of it, frequently bragging about it on earning\u2019s calls and at\nconferences.\n\nSo this division started by first hiring all of the qualified applicants,\nwhich were almost all white men. And then they tried to hire more diverse\napplicants...and hit a brick wall. Why? These people simply don\u2019t exist. As an\nanecdote, I studied computer engineering, exactly the degree these chipmakers\nhire the most. My graduating class of 60 some people in my major had 2 women\nand under 10 minorities.\n\nSo this project at Intel quickly fell behind and was failing because they\ndidn\u2019t have the staff necessary to complete their goals. Their hiring became\nso impossible my friend went to the CEO of Intel and got her division exempted\nfrom DEI requirements. This was all done very quietly.\n\nThe CHIPS Act sadly is a massive failure not because it wasn\u2019t a good idea or\nthe economics of building fabs in the US doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s a failure because\nof the stupid onerous requirements that Democrats added to the bill which make\naccepting the subsidies unfeasible for these large companies.\n\nThe result? No new fabs will be built in the US, chips will continue to be\nmade abroad in conflict zones, national security will suffer, and tens of\nthousands of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars in investment in the US\nwill be made abroad.\n\nSmart move, morons.\n\nThanks for reading Innovation Nation!
