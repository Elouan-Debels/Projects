As this is the season for setting content\ngoals, I recommend thinking the same for your tactics vs strategy.\n\n## Obligatory Sports Analogies\n\nAs a former tennis player this is something you pick up very early on and then\nspend the rest of your life mastering - you need to know to serve and drive\npowerful baseline hits, but you also need to be ready to run up to the net and\nvolley quickly and deftly when the situation (often) arises.\n\nAnyone who has gotten really good thwacks at the golf driving range, and yet\ngotten frustrated on the green when playing 18 holes, is also intimately\nfamiliar that having good long game cannot make up for a horrendous short game\nin golf:\n\n## Playing The DevRel Long Game\n\nAll too often, people only talk about \"short game\" tactical tweaks in devrel:\n\n  * running a content calendar or hackathon\n\n  * editing and marketing a blogpost/video\n\n  * speaking at a conference\n\n  * tying releases and products into themes their community is interested in\n\nYou can spot a \"short game\" by how important and time sensitive the activity\nusually feels at the time, and by how much it feels like it doesn't matter\nafter a month.\n\nI don't mean to minimize \"short game\" - I'm happy to throw down on suggesting\npost titles and charts and tweets - and that can be very impactful when the\nstakes are high, eg you need ONE particular launch/post to go well (so it is\nworth experimenting when the stakes are low so that you have a muscle for what\nto do when stakes are high). However the work done in the short game will be\nsignificantly boosted if you have a good \"long game\", and anyone with good\nenough \"long game\" can actually start inverting the rules of the short game -\nvisibly breaking the understood conventions for engagement and attention - as\na flex (see for example: Mistral choosing to launch with a magnet link and no\nblogpost because they had confidence/network to make it work).\n\nSome half-formed thoughts on what The Long Game looks like:\n\n  * Building product users love\n\n  * Building up good companywide DevRel Infrastructure\n\n  * Working on positioning/pitch\n\n  * Actively participating in your community and the broader industry community beyond it, being perceived as a champion for users and thoughtleader on best practices and the future.\n\nYou will notice how little control the typical individual contributor devrel\nhas over many of these. This is the job of the founder, and other company\nleaders/C-suites, to be actively working with their devrel teams, in order for\nthe long game to actively support the short game.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nUltimately every founder/devrel wants the devrel work to contribute towards\nthe bottom line. The \"short\" game tends to boost virality, but is usually weak\non conversions. The \"long\" game helps improve conversions, but is usually\nboring (e.g. repeating the same thing over and over again, not tying into\ncurrent topics and trends).\n\nThink about the tech that you adopt at work:\n\n  * How did you hear about it at first? Probably through word of mouth from friends and influencers.\n\n  * How often did you hear about it before deciding to give it a serious look? Probably between 2-20 times, which is what we often experienced at Netlify (the common internet marketing wisdom is you need to hear about a product >12 times before people even register you in their list of options)\n\n  * Did you say any of that when you brought it up to your boss for adoption? No, probably not - the messaging you date isn't the same messaging you bring home.\n\nOften people make quick decisions in their gut before then looking for\nrational reasons why their decisions are/are not correct. DevRel must be\nstructured accordingly. In this way, the Long and Short Games mirror the\nSystem 1 and System 2 model of Thinking Fast and Slow.\n\n## Subscribe to our newsletter\n\nRead articles from DX Tips: The DevTools Magazine directly inside your inbox.\nSubscribe to the newsletter, and don't miss out.\n\nDevRel\n\n### Written by\n\n# swyx\n\nWriter & Curator, DX.Tips\n\nWriter & Curator, DX.Tips\n\n### Published on\n\n# DX Tips: The DevTools Magazine\n\nDX Tips is a newsletter focusing on Developer Tools, Developer Relations, and\nall things Developer Experience curated by swyx.
