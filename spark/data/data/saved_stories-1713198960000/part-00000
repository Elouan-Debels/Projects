It is a tool that enables\ndevelopers to use a single modern programming language (Swift) and first-class\ndevelopment environment (Xcode) to build genuinely native apps for both iOS\nand Android.\n\nWatch Video Get Started\n\nSkip is free to try and requires macOS 13, Xcode 15, and Android Studio 2023.\n\n## How Skip Works\n\nAs you build your Swift and SwiftUI app in Xcode, the SkipStone Xcode plugin\ncontinuously transpiles it into the equivalent Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for\nAndroid. Develop dual-platform libraries or entire apps, with native\nperformance and native user interfaces on both platforms.\n\nWant to learn more? Take our video tour or browse the documentation.

Install Skip today!\n\n## Benefits of a Dual-Platform Skip App\n\n### Genuinely Native\n\nSkip apps don\u2019t just \u201clook native\u201d, they are native: Swift and SwiftUI on iOS,\nKotlin and Compose on Android. You know the difference, and so do your users.\n\n### Totally Transparent\n\nWhen you use Skip, no part of your app is hidden from your view... or from\nyour debugger. Skip transpiles your Swift directly into Kotlin source code\nthat you can inspect and customize.\n\n### Featherweight\n\nWith SkipZero, your iOS app has no dependencies on any Skip frameworks. And\nthe resulting Android app only requires a few Skip open source libraries.\n\n### Memory Efficient\n\nWith no additional managed runtime, Skip apps are as efficient as they can\npossibly be on both platforms: bare metal on iOS and ART bytecode on Android.\n\n### An Idyllic IDE\n\nSkip\u2019s IDE is Xcode, the premiere app development environment for iOS. For\nserious Android customization, open the generated code directly in Android\nStudio.\n\n### Perfect Integration\n\nSkip generates standard Kotlin and Compose, so integrating with Android\nlibraries is painless. Call other Kotlin and Java code directly, with no\nbridging required.\n\n### Foundationally Open\n\nSkip\u2019s transpiler is only half the story. The frameworks that underpin iOS app\ndevelopment, such as Foundation and SwiftUI, are made available on Android\nthrough Skip\u2019s free and open-source reimplementations.\n\n### CI Friendly\n\nSkip transpiles unit tests too! You can ensure that your logic performs\nidentically across platforms. Run your tests headlessly either locally or\nremotely, making acceptance testing a breeze.\n\n### Ejectable\n\nYour code is your own \u2013 both the Swift inputs and Kotlin outputs \u2013 so you\naren\u2019t locked into an ongoing dependency on the Skip transpiler.\n\n## Join our Mailing List\n\nSign up to be notified about Skip news, releases, and special offers.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Glimpse I/O, Inc.
