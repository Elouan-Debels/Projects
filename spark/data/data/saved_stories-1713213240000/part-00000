This is over the sea and will replace conventional routes which are over land\n  * New alignments for London City departure routes that pass over Essex and Kent. Other existing routes at the airport are being replicated to RNAV standard, which will enable aircraft to climb to higher altitudes more quickly\n  * Daytime traffic departing Stansted that today heads towards the south will move onto the existing eastbound routes to allow aircraft to climb higher more quickly\n\nHigh level changes, at 7,000ft and above, will also be implemented along the\nsouth coast affecting Bournemouth, Southampton and TAG Farnborough airports.\nThis will mean fewer flights over land.\n\nThe changes support the delivery of the UK\u2019s Future Airspace Strategy (FAS)\nand ensure that this critical but invisible infrastructure, on which an\nindustry that contributes nearly \u00a350bn to the GDP and employs almost one\nmillion people relies, is able to keep pace with the Government\u2019s growth\nforecasts of 40% by 2030.\n\nThe decision by the CAA followed a series of public consultations by NATS,\nLondon City and TAG Farnborough airports as part of the Airspace Change\nProposal.\n\nThis project has benefitted from European Union funding under the Innovation\nand Networks Agency (INEA) / Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).\n\nShare\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Copy link to clipboard\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Airspace change to go live\n\nTop\n\n#### UK Flights\n\n1,125\n\nDeparted today\n\n1,463\n\nLanded today\n\n299\n\nCurrently airborne\n\n4,399\n\nHandled yesterday\n\n### Press releases\n\n####\n\nWarren East appointed Chair of NATS Board\n\n10 Apr 2024\n\n####\n\nEaster fires the starting gun for busy summer ahead\n\n27 Mar 2024\n\n####\n\nNATS and partners recognised at annual air traffic excellence awards\n\n20 Mar 2024\n\n####\n\nIntelligent Approach now fully incorporated in Indra ATM Systems to increase\ncapacity at high traffic volume airports\n\n19 Mar 2024\n\nVisit media centre\n\n#### @NATS Apr 15\n\nAnnnnd they\u2019re off!\n\nYesterday 4 Air Traffic Controllers set off on their motorcycle ride visiting\nall 24 NATS and NATS solutions air traffic control units, raising money for\nProstate Cancer UK and Aerobility.\n\nFollow their journey & support here: 24in24.co.uk\n\n#### @NATS Apr 3\n\nAt Airspace World, we invited leaders from across the world of Air Traffic\nManagement to share their views on the biggest challenges facing our industry.\n\nWatch this special episode of Altitude now youtu.be/rAWt3dGsSRQ\n\n#aviation #avgeeks\n\n#### @NATS Mar 31\n\nFinalising our focus on how the use of #AI, data and machine learning is\nchanging the #aviation sector, we are joined by Andy Taylor, the Chief\nSolutions Officer at @NATS Fascinating discussion on remote tower ops and\ndigital twins! aviation-xtended.co.uk/ep-198-air-tra...\n\n#### @NATS Mar 29\n\nOur ATC team has been working closely with @Gatwick_Airport to deliver a big\nmilestone in the airport\u2019s infrastructure upgrades, with the activation of the\nnew Echo Romeo Rapid Exit Taxiway.\n\nRead more here: bit.ly/4cz3m6E\n\n#### @NATS Mar 27\n\nThis weekend, flights are expected to increase by around 10% next week as the\nbusy summer season gets under way.\n\nRead about how we've prepared for the upcoming months here: bit.ly/3xd3QiN\n\nFollow @NATS on X\n\n### Reports & downloads\n\n  * Annual Report\n  * Modern Slavery Statement\n  * Pay Gap Report\n  * Responsible Business Report\n  * Tax Strategy\n\n### Related websites\n\n  * Aeronautical Information Service (AIS)\n  * Airspace Change Organising Group (ACOG)\n  * Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)\n  * Intelligent Approach\n  * NATS Customer Gateway (restricted)\n\n### Help & support\n\n  * Do it online \u2013 Quick links\n  * Non-Standard Flight applications\n  * Wind farm pre-planning applications\n  * Contact us\n\n\u00a9 Copyright NATS Limited 2024 Sitemap Diversity and Inclusion Privacy notice\nCookies policy GDPR enquiry Terms & conditions\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Instagram\n  * YouTube\n\nSitemap Diversity and Inclusion Privacy notice Cookies policy GDPR enquiry\nTerms & conditions\n\n\u00a9 Copyright NATS Limited 2024\n\nNATS\n\nPlease start typing and we will search our website for you.\n\nSearch Results\n\nBy continuing to use our site, you're agreeing to our use of cookies.
