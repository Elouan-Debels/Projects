The results of this collaboration will both\nsubstantially advance our knowledge of the microbiome and improve on the AI\nprograms that will be used to carry out this work in future.\n\n## Tracing the evolutionary relationships of bacteria\n\nBy playing Borderlands Science, a mini-game within the looter-shooter video\ngame Borderlands 3, these players have helped trace the evolutionary\nrelationships of more than a million different kinds of bacteria that live in\nthe human gut, some of which play a crucial role in our health. This\ninformation represents an exponential increase in what we have discovered\nabout the microbiome up till now. By aligning rows of tiles which represent\nthe genetic building blocks of different microbes, humans have been able to\ntake on tasks that even the best existing computer algorithms have been unable\nto solve yet.\n\nThe project was led by McGill University researchers, developed in\ncollaboration with Gearbox Entertainment Company, an award-winning interactive\nentertainment company, and Massively Multiplayer Online Science (MMOS), a\nSwiss IT company connecting scientists to video games), and supported by the\nexpertise and genomic material from the Microsetta Initiative led by Rob\nKnight from the Departments of Pediatrics, Bioengineering, and Computer\nScience & Engineering at the University of California San Diego.\n\n### Humans improve on existing algorithms and lay groundwork for the future\n\nNot only have the gamers improved on the results produced by the existing\nprograms used to analyze DNA sequences, but they are also helping lay the\ngroundwork for improved AI programs that can be used in future.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know whether the players of a popular game like Borderlands 3 would\nbe interested or whether the results would be good enough to improve on what\nwas already known about microbial evolution. But we\u2019ve been amazed by the\nresults.\u201d says J\u00e9r\u00f4me Waldisp\u00fchl, an associate professor in McGill\u2019s School of\nComputer Science and senior author on the paper published today. \u201cIn half a\nday, the Borderlands Science players collected five times more data about\nmicrobial DNA sequences than our earlier game, Phylo, had collected over a\n10-year period.\u201d\n\nThe idea for integrating DNA analysis into a commercial video game with mass\nmarket appeal came from Attila Szantner, an adjunct professor in McGill\u2019s\nSchool of Computer Science and CEO and co-founder of MMOS. \u201cAs almost half of\nthe world population is playing with videogames, it is of utmost importance\nthat we find new creative ways to extract value from all this time and\nbrainpower that we spend gaming,\u201d says Szantner. \u201cBorderlands Science shows\nhow far we can get by teaming up with the game industry and its communities to\ntackle the big challenges of our times.\u201d\n\n\u201cGearbox\u2019s developers were eager to engage millions of Borderlands players\nglobally with our creation of an appealing in-game experience to demonstrate\nhow clever minds playing Borderlands are capable of producing tangible,\nuseful, and valuable scientific data at a level not approachable with non-\ninteractive technology and mediums,\u201d said Randy Pitchford, founder and CEO of\nGearbox Entertainment Company. \u201cI'm proud that Borderlands Science has become\none of the largest and most accomplished citizen science projects of all time,\nforecasting the opportunity for similar projects in future video games and\npushing the boundaries of the positive effect that video games can make on the\nworld.\u201d\n\n#### Relating microbes to disease and lifestyle\n\nThe tens of trillions of microbes that colonize our bodies play a crucial role\nin maintaining human health. But microbial communities can change over time in\nresponse to factors such as diet, medications, and lifestyle habits.\n\nBecause of the sheer number of microbes involved, scientists are still only in\nthe early days of being able to identify which microorganisms are affected by,\nor can affect, which conditions.\n\nWhich is why the researchers\u2019 project and the results from the gamers are so\nimportant.\n\n\u201cWe expect to be able to use this information to relate specific kinds of\nmicrobes to what we eat, to how we age, and to the many diseases ranging from\ninflammatory bowel disease to Alzheimer\u2019s that we now know microbes to be\ninvolved in,\u201d adds Knight, who also directs the Center for Microbiome\nInnovation at the UC San Diego. \u201cBecause evolution is a great guide to\nfunction, having a better tree relating our microbes to one another gives us a\nmore precise view of what they are doing within and around us.\u201d\n\n#### Building communities to advance knowledge\n\n\u201cHere we have 4.5 million people who contributed to science. In a sense, this\nresult is theirs too and they should feel proud about it,\u201d says Waldisp\u00fchl.\n\u201cIt shows that we can fight the fear or misconceptions that members of the\npublic may have about science and start building communities who work\ncollectively to advance knowledge.\u201d\n\n\u201cBorderlands Science created an incredible opportunity to engage with citizen\nscientists on a novel and important problem, using data generated by a\nseparate massive citizen science project,\u201d adds Daniel McDonald, the\nScientific Director of the Microsetta Initiative. \u201cThese results demonstrate\nthe remarkable value of open access data, and the scale of what is possible\nwith inclusive practices in scientific endeavors.\u201d\n\n#### The study\n\n\u201cImproving microbial phylogeny with citizen science within a mass-market video\ngame\u201d by Roman Sarrazin-Gendron et al was published in Nature Biotechnology\nDOI: 10.1038/s41587-024-02175-6\n\n#### Funders\n\nThe research was funded in part by Genome Canada and G\u00e9nome Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n#### About McGill University\n\nFounded in Montreal, Quebec, in 1821, McGill University is Canada\u2019s top ranked\nmedical doctoral university. McGill is consistently ranked as one of the top\nuniversities, both nationally and internationally. It is a world-renowned\ninstitution of higher learning with research activities spanning three\ncampuses, 12 faculties, 14 professional schools, 300 programs of study and\nover 39,000 students, including more than 10,400 graduate students. McGill\nattracts students from over 150 countries around the world, its 12,000\ninternational students making up 30% of the student body. Over half of McGill\nstudents claim a first language other than English, including approximately\n20% of our students who say French is their mother tongue.\n\n### Contact Information\n\nContact:\n\nKatherine Gombay\n\nOrganization:\n\nMedia Relations Office\n\nEmail:\n\nkatherine.gombay@mcgill.ca\n\nMobile Phone:\n\n(514) 717-2289\n\nCategory:\n\n  * News releases\n  * Faculty of Science\n\nTags:\n\nbiomendical research\n\nBorderlands Science\n\ncitizen science\n\nExternal\n\nMcGill University; School of Computer Science; Research; Jerome Waldispuhl;\nHealth; Microbes\n\nSchool of Computer Science\n\nMon, 04/15/2024 - 13:14\n\nSource Site:\n\n/newsroom\n\n## Related Content\n\n## News\n\n  * ## Millions of gamers advance biomedical research\n\nPublished: 15 Apr 2024\n\n  * ## Campus garden initiatives can help grow the next generation of environmental change-makers\n\nPublished: 11 Apr 2024\n\n  * ## Study finds weak link between adolescent media use and psychotic experiences in adulthood\n\nPublished: 10 Apr 2024\n\nView more news\n\n## Experts\n\n  * ## Experts: Canadian federal budget 2024\n\nPublished: 15 Apr 2024\n\n  * ## Expert: Instagram cracks down on teen sextortion\n\nPublished: 11 Apr 2024\n\n  * ## Experts: Green hydrogen\n\nPublished: 8 Apr 2024\n\nView more news\n\nBack to top\n\n## Department and University Information\n\n## Institutional Communications\n\nJames Administration Building 845 Sherbrooke Street West Montreal, Quebec H3A\n0G4 514-398-6693\n\nContact info\n\n  * Column 1\n\n    * McGill news\n\n      * McGill Reporter\n      * News releases\n      * Office of the President\n      * Office of the Provost\n  * Column 2\n\n    * Resources\n\n      * For faculty and staff\n      * For journalists\n      * McGill experts guide\n      * AskMcGill\n  * Column 3\n\n    * McGill facts\n\n      * About McGill\n      * Quick facts\n      * History\n      * Administration\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nLinkedIn\n\nMcGill Publications\n\nInstagram\n\nMore\n\nMcGill University\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 McGill University\n\nAccessibility Log in\n\n", "frontpage": false}
