The nanoparticle can be seen as the tiny bright spot in the middle.\nFor additional control two copper electrodes are placed above and below the\nparticle.\n\nOptical tweezers (originally called single-beam gradient force trap) are\nscientific instruments that use a highly focused laser beam to hold and move\nmicroscopic and sub-microscopic objects like atoms, nanoparticles and\ndroplets, in a manner similar to tweezers. If the object is held in air or\nvacuum without additional support, it can be called optical levitation.\n\nThe laser light provides an attractive or repulsive force (typically on the\norder of piconewtons), depending on the relative refractive index between\nparticle and surrounding medium. Levitation is possible if the force of the\nlight counters the force of gravity. The trapped particles are usually micron-\nsized, or even smaller. Dielectric and absorbing particles can be trapped,\ntoo.\n\nOptical tweezers are used in biology and medicine (for example to grab and\nhold a single bacterium, a cell like a sperm cell or a blood cell, or a\nmolecule like DNA), nanoengineering and nanochemistry (to study and build\nmaterials from single molecules), quantum optics and quantum optomechanics (to\nstudy the interaction of single particles with light). The development of\noptical tweezing by Arthur Ashkin was lauded with the 2018 Nobel Prize in\nPhysics.\n\n## History and development[edit]\n\nThe detection of optical scattering and the gradient forces on micron sized\nparticles was first reported in 1970 by Arthur Ashkin, a scientist working at\nBell Labs.^[1] Years later, Ashkin and colleagues reported the first\nobservation of what is now commonly referred to as an optical tweezer: a\ntightly focused beam of light capable of holding microscopic particles stable\nin three dimensions.^[2] In 2018, Ashkin was awarded the Nobel Prize in\nPhysics for this development.\n\nOne author of this seminal 1986 paper, Steven Chu, would go on to use optical\ntweezing in his work on cooling and trapping neutral atoms.^[3] This research\nearned Chu the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Claude Cohen-Tannoudji\nand William D. Phillips.^[4] In an interview, Steven Chu described how Ashkin\nhad first envisioned optical tweezing as a method for trapping atoms.^[5]\nAshkin was able to trap larger particles (10 to 10,000 nanometers in diameter)\nbut it fell to Chu to extend these techniques to the trapping of neutral atoms\n(0.1 nanometers in diameter) using resonant laser light and a magnetic\ngradient trap (cf. Magneto-optical trap).\n\nIn the late 1980s, Arthur Ashkin and Joseph M. Dziedzic demonstrated the first\napplication of the technology to the biological sciences, using it to trap an\nindividual tobacco mosaic virus and Escherichia coli bacterium.^[6] Throughout\nthe 1990s and afterwards, researchers like Carlos Bustamante, James Spudich,\nand Steven Block pioneered the use of optical trap force spectroscopy to\ncharacterize molecular-scale biological motors. These molecular motors are\nubiquitous in biology, and are responsible for locomotion and mechanical\naction within the cell. Optical traps allowed these biophysicists to observe\nthe forces and dynamics of nanoscale motors at the single-molecule level;\noptical trap force-spectroscopy has since led to greater understanding of the\nstochastic nature of these force-generating molecules.\n\nOptical tweezers have proven useful in other areas of biology as well. They\nare used in synthetic biology to construct tissue-like networks of artificial\ncells,^[7] and to fuse synthetic membranes together^[8] to initiate\nbiochemical reactions.^[7] They are also widely employed in genetic studies\n^[9] and research on chromosome structure and dynamics.^[10] In 2003 the\ntechniques of optical tweezers were applied in the field of cell sorting; by\ncreating a large optical intensity pattern over the sample area, cells can be\nsorted by their intrinsic optical characteristics.^[11]^[12] Optical tweezers\nhave also been used to probe the cytoskeleton, measure the visco-elastic\nproperties of biopolymers,^[13] and study cell motility. A bio-molecular assay\nin which clusters of ligand coated nano-particles are both optically trapped\nand optically detected after target molecule induced clustering was proposed\nin 2011^[14] and experimentally demonstrated in 2013.^[15]\n\nOptical tweezers are also used to trap laser-cooled atoms in vacuum, mainly\nfor applications in quantum science. Some achievements in this area include\ntrapping of a single atom in 2001,^[16] trapping of 2D arrays of atoms in\n2002,^[17] trapping of strongly interacting entangled pairs in\n2010,^[18]^[19]^[20] trapping precisely assembled 2-dimensional arrays of\natoms in 2016^[21]^[22] and 3-dimensional arrays in 2018.^[23]^[24] These\ntechniques have been used in quantum simulators to obtain programmable arrays\nof 196 and 256 atoms in 2021^[25]^[26]^[27] and represent a promising platform\nfor quantum computing.^[17]^[28]\n\nResearchers have worked to convert optical tweezers from large, complex\ninstruments to smaller, simpler ones, for use by those with smaller research\nbudgets.^[3]^[29]\n\n## Physics[edit]\n\nDielectric objects are attracted to the center of the beam, slightly above the\nbeam waist, as described in the text. The force applied on the object depends\nlinearly on its displacement from the trap center just as with a simple spring\nsystem. It is a restoring force and thus equal to .\n\n### General description[edit]\n\nOptical tweezers are capable of manipulating nanometer and micron-sized\ndielectric particles, and even individual atoms, by exerting extremely small\nforces via a highly focused laser beam. The beam is typically focused by\nsending it through a microscope objective. Near the narrowest point of the\nfocused beam, known as the beam waist, the amplitude of the oscillating\nelectric field varies rapidly in space. Dielectric particles are attracted\nalong the gradient to the region of strongest electric field, which is the\ncenter of the beam. The laser light also tends to apply a force on particles\nin the beam along the direction of beam propagation. This is due to\nconservation of momentum: photons that are absorbed or scattered by the tiny\ndielectric particle impart momentum to the dielectric particle. This is known\nas the scattering force and results in the particle being displaced slightly\ndownstream from the exact position of the beam waist, as seen in the figure.\n\nOptical traps are very sensitive instruments and are capable of the\nmanipulation and detection of sub-nanometer displacements for sub-micron\ndielectric particles.^[30] For this reason, they are often used to manipulate\nand study single molecules by interacting with a bead that has been attached\nto that molecule. DNA and the proteins^[31] and enzymes that interact with it\nare commonly studied in this way.\n\nFor quantitative scientific measurements, most optical traps are operated in\nsuch a way that the dielectric particle rarely moves far from the trap center.\nThe reason for this is that the force applied to the particle is linear with\nrespect to its displacement from the center of the trap as long as the\ndisplacement is small. In this way, an optical trap can be compared to a\nsimple spring, which follows Hooke's law.\n\nFurther information on the light scattering force: Radiation pressure\n\n### Detailed view[edit]\n\nProper explanation of optical trapping behavior depends upon the size of the\ntrapped particle relative to the wavelength of light used to trap it. In cases\nwhere the dimensions of the particle are much greater than the wavelength, a\nsimple ray optics treatment is sufficient. If the wavelength of light far\nexceeds the particle dimensions, the particles can be treated as electric\ndipoles in an electric field. For optical trapping of dielectric objects of\ndimensions within an order of magnitude of the trapping beam wavelength, the\nonly accurate models involve the treatment of either time dependent or time\nharmonic Maxwell equations using appropriate boundary conditions.\n\n#### Ray optics[edit]\n\nRay optics explanation (unfocused laser). When the bead is displaced from the\nbeam center (right image), the larger momentum change of the more intense rays\ncause a net force to be applied back toward the center of the laser. When the\nbead is laterally centered on the beam (left image), the resulting lateral\nforce is zero. But an unfocused laser still causes a force pointing away from\nthe laser.Ray optics explanation (focused laser). In addition to keeping the\nbead in the center of the laser, a focused laser also keeps the bead in a\nfixed axial position: The momentum change of the focused rays causes a force\ntowards the laser focus, both when the bead is in front (left image) or behind\n(right image) the laser focus. So, the bead will stay slightly behind the\nfocus, where this force compensates the scattering force.\n\nIn cases where the diameter of a trapped particle is significantly greater\nthan the wavelength of light, the trapping phenomenon can be explained using\nray optics. As shown in the figure, individual rays of light emitted from the\nlaser will be refracted as it enters and exits the dielectric bead. As a\nresult, the ray will exit in a direction different from which it originated.\nSince light has a momentum associated with it, this change in direction\nindicates that its momentum has changed. Due to Newton's third law, there\nshould be an equal and opposite momentum change on the particle.\n\nMost optical traps operate with a Gaussian beam (TEM_00 mode) profile\nintensity. In this case, if the particle is displaced from the center of the\nbeam, as in the right part of the figure, the particle has a net force\nreturning it to the center of the trap because more intense beams impart a\nlarger momentum change towards the center of the trap than less intense beams,\nwhich impart a smaller momentum change away from the trap center. The net\nmomentum change, or force, returns the particle to the trap center.\n\nIf the particle is located at the center of the beam, then individual rays of\nlight are refracting through the particle symmetrically, resulting in no net\nlateral force. The net force in this case is along the axial direction of the\ntrap, which cancels out the scattering force of the laser light. The\ncancellation of this axial gradient force with the scattering force is what\ncauses the bead to be stably trapped slightly downstream of the beam waist.\n\nThe standard tweezers works with the trapping laser propagated in the\ndirection of gravity^[32] and the inverted tweezers works against gravity.\n\n#### Electric dipole approximation[edit]\n\nIn cases where the diameter of a trapped particle is significantly smaller\nthan the wavelength of light, the conditions for Rayleigh scattering are\nsatisfied and the particle can be treated as a point dipole in an\ninhomogeneous electromagnetic field. The force applied on a single charge in\nan electromagnetic field is known as the Lorentz force,\n\nThe force on the dipole can be calculated by substituting two terms for the\nelectric field in the equation above, one for each charge. The polarization of\na dipole is where is the distance between the two charges. For a point dipole,\nthe distance is infinitesimal, Taking into account that the two charges have\nopposite signs, the force takes the form\n\nNotice that the cancel out. Multiplying through by the charge, , converts\nposition, , into polarization, ,\n\nwhere in the second equality, it has been assumed that the dielectric particle\nis linear (i.e. ).\n\nIn the final steps, two equalities will be used: (1) a vector analysis\nequality, (2) Faraday's law of induction.\n\nFirst, the vector equality will be inserted for the first term in the force\nequation above. Maxwell's equation will be substituted in for the second term\nin the vector equality. Then the two terms which contain time derivatives can\nbe combined into a single term.^[33]\n\nThe second term in the last equality is the time derivative of a quantity that\nis related through a multiplicative constant to the Poynting vector, which\ndescribes the power per unit area passing through a surface. Since the power\nof the laser is constant when sampling over frequencies much longer than the\nfrequency of the laser's light ~10^14 Hz, the derivative of this term averages\nto zero and the force can be written as^[34]\n\nwhere in the second part we have included the induced dipole moment (in MKS\nunits) of a spherical dielectric particle: , where is the particle radius, is\nthe index of refraction of the particle and is the relative refractive index\nbetween the particle and the medium. The square of the magnitude of the\nelectric field is equal to the intensity of the beam as a function of\nposition. Therefore, the result indicates that the force on the dielectric\nparticle, when treated as a point dipole, is proportional to the gradient\nalong the intensity of the beam. In other words, the gradient force described\nhere tends to attract the particle to the region of highest intensity. In\nreality, the scattering force of the light works against the gradient force in\nthe axial direction of the trap, resulting in an equilibrium position that is\ndisplaced slightly downstream of the intensity maximum. Under the Rayleigh\napproximation, we can also write the scattering force as\n\nSince the scattering is isotropic, the net momentum is transferred in the\nforward direction. On the quantum level, we picture the gradient force as\nforward Rayleigh scattering in which identical photons are created and\nannihilated concurrently, while in the scattering (radiation) force the\nincident photons travel in the same direction and \u2018scatter\u2019 isotropically. By\nconservation of momentum, the particle must accumulate the photons' original\nmomenta, causing a forward force in the latter.^[35]\n\n#### Harmonic potential approximation[edit]\n\nA useful way to study the interaction of an atom in a Gaussian beam is to look\nat the harmonic potential approximation of the intensity profile the atom\nexperiences. In the case of the two-level atom, the potential experienced is\nrelated to its AC Stark Shift,\n\nwhere is the natural line width of the excited state, is the electric dipole\ncoupling, is the frequency of the transition, and is the detuning or\ndifference between the laser frequency and the transition frequency.\n\nThe intensity of a gaussian beam profile is characterized by the wavelength ,\nminimum waist , and power of the beam . The following formulas define the beam\nprofile:\n\nTo approximate this Gaussian potential in both the radial and axial directions\nof the beam, the intensity profile must be expanded to second order in and for\nand respectively and equated to the harmonic potential . These expansions are\nevaluated assuming fixed power.\n\nThis means that when solving for the harmonic frequencies (or trap frequencies\nwhen considering optical traps for atoms), the frequencies are given as:\n\nso that the relative trap frequencies for the radial and axial directions as a\nfunction of only beam waist scale as:\n\n### Optical levitation[edit]\n\nIn order to levitate the particle in air, the downward force of gravity must\nbe countered by the forces stemming from photon momentum transfer. Typically\nphoton radiation pressure of a focused laser beam of enough intensity counters\nthe downward force of gravity while also preventing lateral (side to side) and\nvertical instabilities to allow for a stable optical trap capable of holding\nsmall particles in suspension.\n\nMicrometer sized (from several to 50 micrometers in diameter) transparent\ndielectric spheres such as fused silica spheres, oil or water droplets, are\nused in this type of experiment. The laser radiation can be fixed in\nwavelength such as that of an argon ion laser or that of a tunable dye laser.\nLaser power required is of the order of 1 Watt focused to a spot size of\nseveral tens of micrometers. Phenomena related to morphology-dependent\nresonances in a spherical optical cavity have been studied by several research\ngroups.\n\nFor a shiny object, such as a metallic micro-sphere, stable optical levitation\nhas not been achieved. Optical levitation of a macroscopic object is also\ntheoretically possible,^[36] and can be enhanced with nano-structuring.^[37]\n\nMaterials that have been successfully levitated include Black liquor, aluminum\noxide, tungsten, and nickel.^[38]\n\n### Optothermal tweezers[edit]\n\nIn the last two decades, optical forces are combined with thermophoretic\nforces to enable trapping at reduced laser powers, thus resulting in minimized\nphoton damage. By introducing light-absorbing elements (either particles or\nsubstrates), microscale temperature gradients are created, resulting in\nthermophoresis.^[39] Typically, particles (including biological objects such\nas cells, bacteria, DNA/RNA) drift towards the cold - resulting in particle\nrepulsion using optical tweezers. Overcoming this limitation, different\ntechniques such as beam shaping and solution modification with electrolytes\nand surfactants^[40] were used to successfully trap the objects. Laser cooling\nwas also achieved with Ytterbium-doped yttrium lithium fluoride crystals to\ngenerate cold spots using lasers to achieve trapping with reduced\nphotobleaching.^[41] The sample temperature has also been reduced to achieve\noptical trapping for a significantly increased selection of particles using\noptothermal tweezers for drug delivery applications.^[42]\n\n## Setups[edit]\n\nA generic optical tweezer diagram with only the most basic components.\n\nThe most basic optical tweezer setup will likely include the following\ncomponents: a laser (usually Nd:YAG), a beam expander, some optics used to\nsteer the beam location in the sample plane, a microscope objective and\ncondenser to create the trap in the sample plane, a position detector (e.g.\nquadrant photodiode) to measure beam displacements and a microscope\nillumination source coupled to a CCD camera.\n\nAn Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm wavelength) is a common choice of laser for working\nwith biological specimens. This is because such specimens (being mostly water)\nhave a low absorption coefficient at this wavelength.^[43] A low absorption is\nadvisable so as to minimise damage to the biological material, sometimes\nreferred to as opticution. Perhaps the most important consideration in optical\ntweezer design is the choice of the objective. A stable trap requires that the\ngradient force, which is dependent upon the numerical aperture (NA) of the\nobjective, be greater than the scattering force. Suitable objectives typically\nhave an NA between 1.2 and 1.4.^[44]\n\nWhile alternatives are available, perhaps the simplest method for position\ndetection involves imaging the trapping laser exiting the sample chamber onto\na quadrant photodiode. Lateral deflections of the beam are measured similarly\nto how it is done using atomic force microscopy (AFM).\n\nExpanding the beam emitted from the laser to fill the aperture of the\nobjective will result in a tighter, diffraction-limited spot.^[45] While\nlateral translation of the trap relative to the sample can be accomplished by\ntranslation of the microscope slide, most tweezer setups have additional\noptics designed to translate the beam to give an extra degree of translational\nfreedom. This can be done by translating the first of the two lenses labelled\nas \"Beam Steering\" in the figure. For example, translation of that lens in the\nlateral plane will result in a laterally deflected beam from what is drawn in\nthe figure. If the distance between the beam steering lenses and the objective\nis chosen properly, this will correspond to a similar deflection before\nentering the objective and a resulting lateral translation in the sample\nplane. The position of the beam waist, that is the focus of the optical trap,\ncan be adjusted by an axial displacement of the initial lens. Such an axial\ndisplacement causes the beam to diverge or converge slightly, the result of\nwhich is an axially displaced position of the beam waist in the sample\nchamber.^[46]\n\nVisualization of the sample plane is usually accomplished through illumination\nvia a separate light source coupled into the optical path in the opposite\ndirection using dichroic mirrors. This light is incident on a CCD camera and\ncan be viewed on an external monitor or used for tracking the trapped particle\nposition via video tracking.\n\n### Alternative laser beam modes[edit]\n\nThe majority of optical tweezers make use of conventional TEM_00 Gaussian\nbeams. However a number of other beam types have been used to trap particles,\nincluding high order laser beams i.e. Hermite-Gaussian beams (TEM_xy),\nLaguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams (TEM_pl) and Bessel beams.\n\nOptical tweezers based on Laguerre-Gaussian beams have the unique capability\nof trapping particles that are optically reflective and\nabsorptive.^[47]^[48]^[49] Laguerre-Gaussian beams also possess a well-defined\norbital angular momentum that can rotate particles.^[50]^[51] This is\naccomplished without external mechanical or electrical steering of the beam.\n\nBoth zero and higher order Bessel Beams also possess a unique tweezing\nability. They can trap and rotate multiple particles that are millimeters\napart and even around obstacles.^[52]\n\nMicromachines can be driven by these unique optical beams due to their\nintrinsic rotating mechanism due to the spin and orbital angular momentum of\nlight. ^[53]\n\n### Multiplexed optical tweezers[edit]\n\nA typical setup uses one laser to create one or two traps. Commonly, two traps\nare generated by splitting the laser beam into two orthogonally polarized\nbeams. Optical tweezing operations with more than two traps can be realized\neither by time-sharing a single laser beam among several optical\ntweezers,^[54] or by diffractively splitting the beam into multiple traps.\nWith acousto-optic deflectors or galvanometer-driven mirrors, a single laser\nbeam can be shared among hundreds of optical tweezers in the focal plane, or\nelse spread into an extended one-dimensional trap. Specially designed\ndiffractive optical elements can divide a single input beam into hundreds of\ncontinuously illuminated traps in arbitrary three-dimensional configurations.\nThe trap-forming hologram also can specify the mode structure of each trap\nindividually, thereby creating arrays of optical vortices, optical tweezers,\nand holographic line traps, for example.^[55] When implemented with a spatial\nlight modulator, such holographic optical traps also can move objects in three\ndimensions.^[56] Advanced forms of holographic optical traps with arbitrary\nspatial profiles, where smoothness of the intensity and the phase are\ncontrolled, find applications in many areas of science, from micromanipulation\nto ultracold atoms.^[57] Ultracold atoms could also be used for realization of\nquantum computers.^[58]\n\n### Single mode optical fibers[edit]\n\nThe standard fiber optical trap relies on the same principle as the optical\ntrapping, but with the Gaussian laser beam delivered through an optical fiber.\nIf one end of the optical fiber is molded into a lens-like facet, the nearly\ngaussian beam carried by a single mode standard fiber will be focused at some\ndistance from the fiber tip. The effective Numerical Aperture of such assembly\nis usually not enough to allow for a full 3D optical trap but only for a 2D\ntrap (optical trapping and manipulation of objects will be possible only when,\ne.g., they are in contact with a surface ).^[59] A true 3D optical trapping\nbased on a single fiber, with a trapping point which is not in nearly contact\nwith the fiber tip, has been realized based on a not-standard annular-core\nfiber arrangement and a total-internal-reflection geometry.^[60]\n\nOn the other hand, if the ends of the fiber are not moulded, the laser exiting\nthe fiber will be diverging and thus a stable optical trap can only be\nrealised by balancing the gradient and the scattering force from two opposing\nends of the fiber. The gradient force will trap the particles in the\ntransverse direction, while the axial optical force comes from the scattering\nforce of the two counter propagating beams emerging from the two fibers. The\nequilibrium z-position of such a trapped bead is where the two scattering\nforces equal each other. This work was pioneered by A. Constable et al., Opt.\nLett. 18,1867 (1993), and followed by J.Guck et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 5451\n(2000), who made use of this technique to stretch microparticles. By\nmanipulating the input power into the two ends of the fiber, there will be an\nincrease of an \"optical stretching\" that can be used to measure viscoelastic\nproperties of cells, with sensitivity sufficient to distinguish between\ndifferent individual cytoskeletal phenotypes. i.e. human erythrocytes and\nmouse fibroblasts. A recent test has seen great success in differentiating\ncancerous cells from non-cancerous ones from the two opposed, non-focused\nlaser beams.^[61]\n\n### Multimode fiber-based traps[edit]\n\nThe Optical Cell Rotator is a fiber based laser trap that can hold and\nprecisely orient living cells for tomographic microscopy.\n\nWhile earlier version of fiber-based laser traps exclusively used single mode\nbeams, M. Kreysing and colleagues recently showed that the careful excitation\nof further optical modes in a short piece of optical fiber allows the\nrealization of non-trivial trapping geometries. By this the researchers were\nable to orient various human cell types (individual cells and clusters) on a\nmicroscope. The main advantage of the so-called \"optical cell rotator\"\ntechnology over standard optical tweezers is the decoupling of trapping from\nimaging optics. This, its modular design, and the high compatibility of\ndivergent laser traps with biological material indicates the great potential\nof this new generation of laser traps in medical research and life\nscience.^[62] Recently, the optical cell rotator technology was implemented on\nthe basis of adaptive optics, allowing to dynamically reconfigure the optical\ntrap during operation and adapt it to the sample.^[63]\n\n### Cell sorting[edit]\n\nOne of the more common cell-sorting systems makes use of flow cytometry\nthrough fluorescence imaging. In this method, a suspension of biologic cells\nis sorted into two or more containers, based upon specific fluorescent\ncharacteristics of each cell during an assisted flow. By using an electrical\ncharge that the cell is \"trapped\" in, the cells are then sorted based on the\nfluorescence intensity measurements. The sorting process is undertaken by an\nelectrostatic deflection system that diverts cells into containers based upon\ntheir charge.\n\nIn the optically actuated sorting process, the cells are flowed through into\nan optical landscape i.e. 2D or 3D optical lattices. Without any induced\nelectrical charge, the cells would sort based on their intrinsic refractive\nindex properties and can be re-configurability for dynamic sorting. An optical\nlattice can be created using diffractive optics and optical elements.^[11]\n\nOn the other hand, K. Ladavac et al. used a spatial light modulator to project\nan intensity pattern to enable the optical sorting process.^[64] K. Xiao and\nD. G. Grier applied holographic video microscopy to demonstrate that this\ntechnique can sort colloidal spheres with part-per-thousand resolution for\nsize and refractive index.^[65]\n\nThe main mechanism for sorting is the arrangement of the optical lattice\npoints. As the cell flow through the optical lattice, there are forces due to\nthe particles drag force that is competing directly with the optical gradient\nforce (See Physics of optical tweezers) from the optical lattice point. By\nshifting the arrangement of the optical lattice point, there is a preferred\noptical path where the optical forces are dominant and biased. With the aid of\nthe flow of the cells, there is a resultant force that is directed along that\npreferred optical path. Hence, there is a relationship of the flow rate with\nthe optical gradient force. By adjusting the two forces, one will be able to\nobtain a good optical sorting efficiency.\n\nCompetition of the forces in the sorting environment need fine tuning to\nsucceed in high efficient optical sorting. The need is mainly with regards to\nthe balance of the forces; drag force due to fluid flow and optical gradient\nforce due to arrangement of intensity spot.\n\nScientists at the University of St. Andrews have received considerable funding\nfrom the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for an\noptical sorting machine. This new technology could rival the conventional\nfluorescence-activated cell sorting.^[66]\n\n### Evanescent fields[edit]\n\nAn evanescent field^[67] is a residue optical field that \"leaks\" during total\ninternal reflection. This \"leaking\" of light fades off at an exponential rate.\nThe evanescent field has found a number of applications in nanometer\nresolution imaging (microscopy); optical micromanipulation (optical tweezers)\nare becoming ever more relevant in research.\n\nIn optical tweezers, a continuous evanescent field can be created when light\nis propagating through an optical waveguide (multiple total internal\nreflection). The resulting evanescent field has a directional sense and will\npropel microparticles along its propagating path. This work was first\npioneered by S. Kawata and T. Sugiura, in 1992, who showed that the field can\nbe coupled to the particles in proximity on the order of 100 nanometers.^[68]\nThis direct coupling of the field is treated as a type of photon tunnelling\nacross the gap from prism to microparticles. The result is a directional\noptical propelling force.\n\nA recent updated version of the evanescent field optical tweezers makes use of\nextended optical landscape patterns to simultaneously guide a large number of\nparticles into a preferred direction without using a waveguide. It is termed\nas Lensless Optical Trapping (\"LOT\"). The orderly movement of the particles is\naided by the introduction of Ronchi Ruling that creates well-defined optical\npotential wells (replacing the waveguide). This means that particles are\npropelled by the evanescent field while being trapped by the linear bright\nfringes. At the moment, there are scientists working on focused evanescent\nfields as well.\n\nIn recent studies, the evanescent field generated by mid-infrared laser has\nbeen used to sort particles by molecular vibrational resonance selectively.\nMid-infrared light is commonly used to identify molecular structures of\nmaterials because the vibrational modes exist in the mid-infrared region. A\nstudy by Statsenko et al. described optical force enhancement by molecular\nvibrational resonance by exciting the stretching mode of Si-O-Si bond at 9.3\n\u03bcm.^[69] It is shown that silica microspheres containing significant Si-O-Si\nbond move up to ten times faster than polystyrene microspheres due to\nmolecular vibrational resonance. Moreover, this same group also investigated\nthe possibility of optical force chromatography based on molecular vibrational\nresonance.^[70]\n\nAnother approach that has been recently proposed makes use of surface\nplasmons, which is an enhanced evanescent wave localized at a metal/dielectric\ninterface. The enhanced force field experienced by colloidal particles exposed\nto surface plasmons at a flat metal/dielectric interface has been for the\nfirst time measured using a photonic force microscope, the total force\nmagnitude being found 40 times stronger compared to a normal evanescent\nwave.^[71] By patterning the surface with gold microscopic islands it is\npossible to have selective and parallel trapping in these islands. The forces\nof the latter optical tweezers lie in the femtonewton range.^[72]\n\nThe evanescent field can also be used to trap cold atoms and molecules near\nthe surface of an optical waveguide or optical nanofiber.^[73]^[74]\n\n### Indirect approach[edit]\n\nMing Wu, a UC Berkeley Professor of electrical engineering and computer\nsciences invented the new optoelectronic tweezers.\n\nWu transformed the optical energy from low powered light emitting diodes (LED)\ninto electrical energy via a photoconductive surface. The idea is to allow the\nLED to switch on and off the photoconductive material via its fine projection.\nAs the optical pattern can be easily transformable through optical projection,\nthis method allows a high flexibility of switching different optical\nlandscapes.\n\nThe manipulation/tweezing process is done by the variations between the\nelectric field actuated by the light pattern. The particles will be either\nattracted or repelled from the actuated point due to its induced electrical\ndipole. Particles suspended in a liquid will be susceptible to the electrical\nfield gradient, this is known as dielectrophoresis.\n\nOne clear advantage is that the electrical conductivity is different between\ndifferent kinds of cells. Living cells have a lower conductive medium while\nthe dead ones have minimum or no conductive medium. The system may be able to\nmanipulate roughly 10,000 cells or particles at the same time.\n\nSee comments by Professor Kishan Dholakia on this new technique, K. Dholakia,\nNature Materials 4, 579\u2013580 (01 Aug 2005) News and Views.\n\n\"The system was able to move live E. coli bacteria and 20-micrometre-wide\nparticles, using an optical power output of less than 10 microwatts. This is\none-hundred-thousandth of the power needed for [direct] optical\ntweezers\".^[75]\n\nAnother notably new type of optical tweezers is optothermal tweezers invented\nby Yuebing Zheng at The University of Texas at Austin. The strategy is to use\nlight to create a temperature gradient and exploit the thermophoretic\nmigration of matter for optical trapping.^[76] The team further integrated\nthermophoresis with laser cooling to develop opto-refrigerative tweezers to\navoid thermal damages for noninvasive optical trapping and manipulation.^[77]\n\n### Optical binding[edit]\n\nWhen a cluster of microparticles are trapped within a monochromatic laser\nbeam, the organization of the microparticles within the optical trapping is\nheavily dependent on the redistributing of the optical trapping forces amongst\nthe microparticles. This redistribution of light forces amongst the cluster of\nmicroparticles provides a new force equilibrium on the cluster as a whole. As\nsuch we can say that the cluster of microparticles are somewhat bound together\nby light. One of the first experimental evidence of optical binding was\nreported by Michael M. Burns, Jean-Marc Fournier, and Jene A.\nGolovchenko,^[78] though it was originally predicted by T.\nThirunamachandran.^[79] One of the many recent studies on optical binding has\nshown that for a system of chiral nanoparticles, the magnitude of the binding\nforces are dependent on the polarisation of the laser beam and the handedness\nof interacting particles themselves,^[80] with potential applications in areas\nsuch as enantiomeric separation and optical nanomanipulation.\n\n### Fluorescence optical tweezers[edit]\n\nIn order to simultaneously manipulate and image samples that exhibit\nfluorescence, optical tweezers can be built alongside a fluorescence\nmicroscope.^[81] Such instruments are particularly useful when it comes to\nstudying single or small numbers of biological molecules that have been\nfluorescently labelled, or in applications in which fluorescence is used to\ntrack and visualize objects that are to be trapped.\n\nThis approach has been extended for simultaneous sensing and imaging of\ndynamic protein complexes using long and strong tethers generated by a highly\nefficient multi-step enzymatic approach^[82] and applied to investigations of\ndisaggregation machines in action.^[83]\n\n### Tweezers combined with other imaging techniques[edit]\n\nOther than 'standard' fluorescence optical tweezers are now being built with\nmultiple color Confocal, Widefield, STED, FRET, TIRF or IRM.\n\nThis allows applications such as measuring: protein/DNA localization binding,\nprotein folding, condensation, motor protein force generation, visualization\nof cytoskeletal filaments and motor dynamics, microtubule dynamics,\nmanipulating liquid droplet (rheology) or fusion. These setups are difficult\nto build and traditionally are found in non correlated 'academic' setups. In\nthe recent years even home builders (both biophysics and general biologists)\nare converting to the alternative and are acquiring total correlated solution\nwith easy data acquisition and data analysis.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n  * Atom optics\n  * Levitation\n  * List of laser articles\n  * Quantum control\n  * Quantum optics\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Ashkin, A.
