The authors are the architects,\nurban planners, and/or strategists behind the projects that have transformed\nthese three cities and are studied in the \"Schools of Cities\" and \"Documentary\nCourses\" made by CityMakers. On this occasion, Victor Restrepo, Coordinator of\nCityMakers in Medellin, presents his article \"Medellin: A Case Study\".\n\nMedell\u00edn stands as an inspiring example for many cities worldwide. It is a\ncity that transitioned from deep collective fear to hopeful enthusiasm for\nurban and social life characterized by quality and coexistence. The city's\ncrisis has always been associated with violence and drug trafficking. However,\nthis crisis is more structural and profound, it responds to many more factors,\nsome of which are associated with the accelerated growth of its population, as\nin many Latin American cities.\n\n\\+ 7\n\nSave this picture!\n\nMedell\u00edn.

Gold and coffee were\nthe country's main export products for much of the 19th and 20th centuries,\nleading to capital accumulation and the establishment of industries, which\nsolidified the city as the country's main industrial center by 1950. These\nconditions of progress and stability triggered migrations, which settled\nirregularly and informally on the slopes and outskirts of the city. During\nthis time, significant infrastructure and service projects were developed,\nshaping the city's future: the construction and operation of the Antioquia\nRailway (1870-1930), the installation of electricity (1898), the installation\nof the aqueduct (1914), and the electric tram (1921).\n\nSave this picture!\n\nOLD TRAM_Inauguration of the electric tram in the Parque de Berr\u00edo.1921. Image\nCourtesy of CityMakers\n\nIn the 1920s, the municipal administration decided to build housing in the\nneighborhoods of Manrique, Aranjuez, and Gerona, all located in the\nnortheastern and eastern parts of the city, as a strategy to regulate urban\ngrowth resulting from population increase and migration. During this period,\nthe hillsides were just beginning to be inhabited, often in a disorderly\nmanner, as seen in the subsequent decades. Simultaneously, due to the state's\nlimited capacity to promote and manage public policies for land\nregularization, the existence of more informal settlements began to be\nrecorded, particularly in the neighborhoods of Bel\u00e9n and La Am\u00e9rica, in the\nwestern part of the city.\n\nSave this picture!\n\nMANRIQUE NEIGHBORHOOD_1930. Image Courtesy of CityMakers\n\n### The Conflict City\n\nFrom the 1950s, the city experienced significant population growth, this\nbrought with it an urbanization that surpassed the State's capacity to provide\nplanned housing solutions, and a large informal market for developable land\nand housing quickly emerged.\n\nAnother factor, the one with the greatest impact, was the appearance of drug\ntrafficking in the neighborhoods. In the narrow streets and urban life, drug\ntrafficking found a favorable environment to thrive. Medell\u00edn plunged into a\nprofound crisis during the 1980s and 1990s, as known by all. \"Medell\u00edn became\na city with a conflicted economic, social, and urban geography.\"\n\nHowever, the crisis became the catalyst for the city's transformation. Helped\nby other events of political and social transition during these years, which\nsought greater territorial autonomy and citizen participation, comprehensive\nintervention strategies were conceived for territories characterized by\ninformality, irregularity, and social impact resulting from violence and state\nneglect.\n\nSave this picture!\n\nMass Transportation System Plan 1921-1951.

Lessons\nlearned from each of these formed the foundation for Social Urbanism in\nMedell\u00edn. Similarly, the mass transit system Metro was fundamental, as its\nmobility axes and stations became triggering and integrating elements of the\nPUIs.\n\nThe PUIs are an intervention strategy that applies the Social Urbanism model\ncomposed of three components: physical, social, and institutional. The\nphysical component is based on multi-scale urban interventions, involving\nimpactful projects with high aesthetic quality on public space, collective\nfacilities, housing, mobility, and the environment\u2014a chain of projects\ngradually transforming the territory. The social component relies on a\nstrategy of constant dialogue. This mechanism reaches territories before\nphysical interventions, creating scenarios for the identification, of issues,\nand spaces for understanding and proposals. The community is co-author and\noverseer of the projects before, during, and after. This component is in a\nconstant search for a sense of belonging and sustainability. Finally, the\ninstitutional component becomes the coordinator of actions of all municipal\ndepartments, ensuring constant support. Many facilities become municipal\nspaces for on-site work, coordinating all necessary actions to keep citizen\nparticipation scenarios active.\n\nThe city has designed and implemented PUIs in its northeastern, eastern,\nnorthwestern, and central-western areas.\n\nSave this picture!\n\nCitizen Participation_EDU.

Another fundamental factor was the location of the Metrocable, which was\nunder construction, an opportunity to articulate strategic projects and\nprograms for the city's structural mobility system.\n\nThe diagnosis of each component led to intervention conclusions. From a\nphysical standpoint, environmental components and various natural water and\nsoil resources were analyzed, as well as the different urban structures of\nsubdivisions and blocks, their road structure, and their housing component.\nFrom the social aspect, the analysis focuses on the level of education, access\nto health, per capita income, and homicides. And from the institutional\ncomponent, all the departments of the municipality carry out a detailed study\naccording to their mission.\n\n\"In the diagnosis, the street was found to be a key element, both physically\nand symbolically. With the deficit of public space that these neighborhoods\nhad, the street is the meeting point, the place of transit, but also the place\nto be. Therefore, the street became the main stage.\" This is why one of the\nbig bets of the PUI was to design and rebuild the street for social\ninteraction, entertainment, and connection, in addition to all infrastructure\nprojects and equipment of multiple scales.\n\nSave this picture!\n\nPUI NORTHEASTERN _ Metrocable - Biblioteca Espa\u00f1a.

This bridge became a symbol of union and\nreconciliation between neighborhoods since up to that time there were\nimaginary borderlines due to gang rivalry.\n\nSave this picture!\n\nAndalusia-La Francia interbarrilla bridge_EDU.

Its fragmented design allows\nflexibility and autonomy for use. This project serves as a model for education\nand culture in areas with high school dropout rates. It becomes a symbol of\nresilience and belonging for all citizens.\n\nIn the PUI there is a commitment to quality architecture with a high aesthetic\nsense that aims to resignify the places and their inhabitants. Giving the best\nis a message of deserving.\n\nSave this picture!\n\nPUI NORTHEASTERN. Image Courtesy of CityMakers\n\nSave this picture!\n\nPUI NORTH Biblioteca Espa\u00f1a.

The strategy for this area was innovative and risky and was given\nthrough electric stairs, a result of collective workshops and socialization\nwith citizens to solve mobility issues in the sector. These stairs are\nintegrated with small parks, viaducts, and pathways along the mountainous\ntopography, fostering vibrant street life and social interaction.\n\nThrough this physical intervention, Commune 13 has built an extraordinary hub\nof economic, cultural, and social development, improving residents' quality of\nlife and creating a globally recognized brand. Today, not only the residents\nof the neighborhood pass through its stairs, bridges, and streets, but also\nthe world has arrived there, culture and entertainment.\n\nSave this picture!\n\nPUI 13_Electric Stairs.
