These are also\n> the 1st and 3rd most expensive cities in the US... So empirically, as you\n> move along the density spectrum from the empty North Dakota plain to\n> Manhattan, housing prices go up.\n\nHe goes on to argue that more people prefer to live in big cities than there\nare available housing units. Given the housing shortage in major cities, this\nsupply/demand mismatch is fairly evident.\n\nHowever, he goes further to suggest that this preference for density is what's\ndriving demand.\n\n> For example, if my home city of Oakland (population 500,000) became ten\n> times denser, it would build 4.5 million new units and end up about as dense\n> as Manhattan or London. But Manhattan and London have the highest house\n> prices in their respective countries, primarily because of their density and\n> the opportunities density provides.\n\nIf any given city were to build more housing and grow, he reasons, it would\nbecome more desirable to a mobile subset of Americans that want to live in\nbig, dense cities\u2014and thus more expensive. The global supply of housing would\nincrease (thus decreasing global prices) but the city in which new housing was\nbuilt would become proportionally more attractive, offsetting any local\nbenefits to affordability. This is how Alexander explains the correlation\nbetween density and housing prices.\n\nPictured: Lots of housing. Not pictured: Lots of high paying jobs.\n\nThere's something to Alexander's argument. My own research at UC Berkeley\nfound that there is indeed a price premium for housing in dense, walkable\nneighborhoods relative to metro-wide median property values. At the\nneighborhood-level, people do prefer density! However, when we're talking\nabout differences in housing costs across metros, these effects are marginal\nat best.\n\nI appreciate Alexander's epistemic humility on the subject (\"Tell me why I'm\nwrong!\") so I'll take him up on the request. I suspect his argument is derived\nfrom a common saliency bias. People see dense housing all around them in\nexpensive cities and believe there must be a causal relationship. Fortunately,\nwe can use data to help us overcome these biases.\n\n## To the data!\n\nLooking at 2017-2021 ACS data for all American Core-Based Statistical Areas\n(CBSAs), we can see there is indeed some correlative relationship between\ndensity and housing values, but it\u2019s not particularly strong.\n\nAlexander has the causal relationship backwards. Money doesn't follow housing;\nhousing follows money. The money used to bid on housing has to come from\nsomewhere...\n\nYes, the critical missing piece to Alexander's analysis is jobs. The North\nDakota plains aren't just lacking housing; they're lacking jobs. If lots of\nhigh-paying jobs were to appear, the income they generate would flow into\nhousing. If the supply of housing were limited, its value would increase.\n\nIn fact, this is exactly what happened in North Dakota during the Bakken\nFormation oil boom of the 2010s. Oil workers who traveled to reap the benefits\nof expanded oil production arrived to discover houses and apartments renting\nfor $3,000 a month. Many found themselves living in trailers.\n\nFox Run RV park in Williston, North Dakota, 2015 | Photo by Andrew Cullen / Inside Energy\n\nWhile housing prices are the result of many factors, there are three main\ndrivers:\n\n  1. ## The number of available jobs\n\n  2. ## The salaries of those jobs\n\n  3. ## The amount of housing available for those workers\n\nFor the purpose of demonstrating this relationship, we can combine variables\n#1 and #2 into aggregate income, which is the total income from all jobs in a\nmetropolitan area. As expected, aggregate income and total housing supply are\nclosely correlated.\n\nThat isn\u2019t a very user-friendly chart so here\u2019s an interactive version that\nlets you zoom in.\n\nMetros above the fitted line have either a lot of jobs or higher-paying jobs\nrelative to the number of housing units available. On this side of the line,\nwe find San Jose, San Francisco, and Washington DC.\n\nMetros below the fitted line have a lot of housing relative to their aggregate\nincome. On this side, we find Detroit, Tampa, and Phoenix.\n\nThere\u2019s already a pattern emerging here, but let\u2019s make it clearer.\n\nIf we turn these two metrics into a single ratio \u2014 aggregate income per unit\nof housing \u2014 we can plot that against median home values.\n\nWhat we find is a significantly stronger correlation! Aggregate income per\nunit of housing predicts approximately 56% of the variation in median values\nat the metro level. We now have an explanation for why San Jose is more\nexpensive than San Francisco despite having lower housing density (one might\nsay it's because of its lower housing density).\n\nMeanwhile, our outliers are exceptions that prove the rule.\n\nPlaces like Key West, FL, Kahului, HI, and Ocean City, NJ have high property\nvalues relative to their aggregate incomes per unit of housing because the\nincome that drives those values up comes from jobs in other places\u2014these are\nvacation home markets.\n\nOn the other side, we have places with low property values relative to\naggregate income per unit of housing. Los Alamos, NM, stands out here. Los\nAlamos is effectively a company town for Los Alamos National Laboratory (where\nthe atomic bomb was invented during WWII). According to their website, Los\nAlamos National Laboratory employs 14,150 people. The population of Los Alamos\nis just shy of 13,000 (some commute from nearby Santa Fe). These are high-\npaying jobs, but given that there's only one employer in town, the pool of\npotential buyers is very small, and thus property values are unusually low.\n\nLos Alamos: Where Discoveries Are Made! (Unless you want to discover a buyer\nfor your home when Los Alamos National Laboratory isn\u2019t hiring).\n\nLet\u2019s set these outliers aside by running the data one more time but only\nincluding metros with a population larger than 1 million.\n\nSure enough, the relationship gets even stronger! An r-value of 0.9 suggests\nthat over 81% of median home values in large metros can be attributed to\naggregate income per unit of housing.\n\n## Change Over Time\n\nOK, comparing metros to one another clarifies the importance of jobs and\nhousing supply in outcomes between regions, but what we really want to know is\nwhether building more housing in a given metro (above and beyond job and wage\ngrowth) would lower the cost of housing.\n\nUnfortunately, that didn't happen in any major metro in the last decade, so we\ndon't have a great case study (yes, this is why every city is becoming\nunaffordable). But we can see that there's a strong relationship between the\nchange in aggregate income per unit of housing and the change in median\nproperty value over time, just as there is across cities for a given period of\ntime.\n\nThis model is even stronger for predicting changes in rents; 74% of these\nchanges can be explained by changes in aggregate income per unit of housing.\n\nFor a far more rigorous analysis of this relationship within a single city\nover time, please refer to Erica Fischer\u2019s brilliant work collecting and\nanalyzing 30 years of for-rent ads in San Francisco:\n\nGreen Line: # of units, wages, and #of jobs | Purple Stars: median rent in San Francisco\n\nWhile it might help reduce the cost of housing, I don't suspect anyone wants\naggregate income in their city to fall. Affordable as they may be, the story\nof cities like Detroit and St. Louis is not a happy one.\n\nThat leaves us with one big lever: housing supply. The only real way to reduce\nhousing costs is to build more housing for that aggregate income to flow into.\n\n\"Build more housing\" isn't a singular policy, but a coherent suite of policies\nthat begins to address the challenge on a variety of regulatory fronts. That\nsuite includes eliminating single-family zoning (as recently enacted in\nMinneapolis and Portland), abolishing parking minimums, and updating building\ncodes to allow more efficient use of floor plates with single-stair apartment\nbuildings. It may also involve experimentation with land value tax as a method\nto incentivize development and reduce land speculation. Less obvious factors\nlike immigration policy play a role in construction costs.\n\nPerhaps most centrally, the \"Build more housing\" policy suite must include\nreforms that address the vetocracy that governs housing development in the\nUnited States, which co-opts environmental review and community oversight\nmechanisms to ensure that very little gets built in American cities. As\nJerusalem Demsas aptly writes, our communities have become \"like a homeowners'\nassociation from hell, backed by the force of the law.\"\n\nHow did it get so bad? As a former city planner, it pains me to acknowledge\nthat upstream of this crisis we find the planning profession\u2019s active\nabdication of power following the reckoning of mid-century urban renewal. As\nThomas Campanella wrote in Places Journal, \u201cPlanning in America has been\nreduced to smallness and timidity, and largely by its own hand.\u201d Addressing\nthe housing crisis will require planners to step up as the adults in the room,\nbecoming a muscular-yet-accountable force for the greater good rather than\nstewards of homeowner selfishness.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t have wealthy and affordable cities. We just have to\nincrease the denominator of aggregate income per household.\n\nLet\u2019s return to Alexander.\n\n> I don't see why Oakland being able to tell a different story of how it\n> reached Manhattan/London density levels (\"it was because we were YIMBYs and\n> deliberately cultivated density to lower prices\") would make the end result\n> any different from the real Manhattan or London.\n\nIn fact, the YIMBY story would make a world of difference in the end result!\nThe story of Manhattan and London is one of housing supply lagging behind a\ndramatic growth of high-paying jobs. Their housing densities mask an even\ngreater density of jobs. When jobs boom, it can be hard for housing supply to\nkeep up, but it\u2019s not impossible. A story in which housing supply keeps up\nwith job growth creates a housing market more like that of Tokyo.\n\nAlexander's argument overlooks the critical role of jobs and income in the\nhousing price equation. The data shows us that it's largely the ratio of\naggregate income to housing supply that\u2019s really driving housing prices. The\nkey to our affordability crisis is ensuring that housing supply keeps up with\nlocal job markets.\n\nScott Alexander, I hope I've changed your mind.\n\nNotes\n\n  1. You may be surprised to see New York\u2019s relatively moderate home values. At first I thought this may be due to data collection during the pandemic, but I checked the 2007-2011 and 2012-2016 ACS data and it looks basically the same. I suspect this is due to some combination of the New York CBSA boundaries being enormous (see below) and perhaps New York homes being very small.\n\nNew York CBSA boundary\n\nKasey KlimesMay 4, 2023Comment\n\nTwitter 1 Like\n\n### Comments (0)\n\nNewest First\n\nPreview Post Comment...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
