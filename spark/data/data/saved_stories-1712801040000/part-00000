In collaboration with several\npartners \u2014 including KDDI, ARTERIA, Citadel Pacific, and the Commonwealth of\nthe Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) \u2014 these cables will create new fiber-optic\nroutes between the continental U.S. and Japan in support of Google\u2019s Japan\nDigitization Initiative, while improving the reliability and resilience of\ndigital connectivity between the U.S., Japan, and multiple Pacific Island\ncountries and territories.\n\nThe Proa subsea cable from NEC will connect Japan, the CNMI, and Guam and is\nnamed after the traditional sailing canoes of the Marianas. To further\nincrease reliability in the region, the NEC cable system Taiwan-\nPhilippines-U.S. (known as TPU) will be extended to the CNMI. As the CNMI\u2019s\nfirst international subsea cables, Proa and TPU will together establish a new\nroute between the continental U.S. and Shima, Japan.\n\nTaihei, the Japanese word for both \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201cPacific Ocean,\u201d is another NEC\ncable that will connect Japan to Hawaii. Additionally, Tabua will be extended\nto Hawaii, building on the plans announced last year to run the cable from the\ncontinental U.S. to Fiji and Australia. Once complete, the Taihei and Tabua\nsystems will create a diverse path between the continental U.S. to Takahagi,\nJapan.\n\nGoogle will also fund the construction of an interlink cable connecting\nHawaii, the CNMI, and Guam. This interlink will connect the transpacific\nroutes, improving their reliability and reducing latency for users in the\nPacific Islands and around the world.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply honored to have the privilege of naming the cable 'Proa' and\nparticipating in the unveiling of this transformative network set to\nrevolutionize connectivity in the CNMI. The name 'Proa', drawing inspiration\nfrom our traditional sailing canoes, encapsulates the essence of connectivity\nand cultural heritage. It signifies the collaborative journey this project\nembodies, reflecting resilience and progress as we collectively move towards a\nfuture brimming with opportunities and prosperity for our islands. Our\nheartfelt thanks go out to Google for their steadfast dedication to including\nthe CNMI in the Pacific Connect Initiative, perfectly aligning with our vision\nfor a more connected, resilient, and technologically advanced Pacific region.\"\n- Arnold I. Palacios, Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana\nIslands\n\n\u201cIn partnership with Governor Green\u2019s administration, Hawaii's Connect Kakou\ninitiative is working to ensure people from all walks of life have reliable\nand affordable access to high-speed Internet. The Pacific Connect initiative\nperfectly complements our planned efforts, and will significantly enhance our\nfuture connections from Hawaii to the continental U.S. and Japan as well as\nensure communities across the Pacific have equitable and reliable access to\ndigital services.\" - Sylvia Luke, Lieutenant Governor, State of Hawaii\n\n\u201cGoogle and KDDI have a long history of collaboration on submarine cables,\nincluding cable landings in Japan. KDDI is delighted to embark on this new\nproject, and the collaboration will contribute to increasing the reliability\nof submarine cable networks in the Pacific.\u201d - Makoto Takahashi, President,\nRepresentative Director, CEO at KDDI CORPORATION\n\n\"Connectivity between Tokyo \u2014 the heart of the Internet in Japan \u2014 and\noverseas has been concentrated in Minami-boso, Chiba Prefecture. The Ibaraki\nregion, including Takahagi, had not had any submarine cable landings for over\n20 years until the arrival of Topaz, which ARTERIA has supported. Leveraging\nthe landing facilities for the Topaz project, we are delighted to partner\nfurther with Google for this visionary initiative, which will contribute to\nstrengthening Japan's digital infrastructure. As a partner of the Pacific\nConnect initiative, we look forward to its future development.\" - Tatsuya Abe,\nPresident and CEO at ARTERIA Networks Corporation\n\n\u201cCitadel is pleased to partner with Google on this groundbreaking initiative\nto construct core ICT nodes in CNMI and Guam as part of the Pacific Connect\nproject. This initiative promises to transform internet connectivity across\nthe Pacific region, ushering in an era of unparalleled reach, reliability and\nresilience. By investing in new international subsea cable infrastructure and\ncreation of these core ICT nodes in CNMI and Guam, IT&E, a subsidiary of\nCitadel, will be empowered to deliver significantly expanded internet services\nto the residents of islands. The CNMI will be directly connected to\ninternational networks for the first time in history. This translates to a\nfuture of faster speeds, wider availability and a stronger, more stable\nconnection \u2014 a boon for homes, businesses and organizations alike. Citadel and\nGoogle are steadfast in their commitment to building a brighter digital future\nfor the Pacific. Today's announcement marks a significant milestone in this\njourney.\u201c - Jim Beighley, CEO at Citadel Pacific\n\nSubsea cables can bring economic and productivity gains to the places where\nthey land. For example, in Japan, studies estimate Google network\ninfrastructure investments drove an additional $400+ million in GDP in the\nprevious decade. With increased access to digital services, more people can\ntake advantage of skill development and career opportunities, while businesses\nand public sector organizations can better serve their customers and\nconstituents.\n\nWe\u2019re excited about the long-term benefits that these latest Pacific\ninitiatives will bring to people, our users, and our customers. We\u2019ll continue\nto share more as we continue working with partners to reduce the digital\ndivide across the Pacific.\n\nInfrastructure\n\n##### Introducing Bulikula and Halaihai, subsea cables to connect the central\nPacific\n\nThe Bulikula and Halaihai subsea cables will connect Guam with Fiji and French\nPolynesia to increase central Pacific connectivity.\n\nBy Brian Quigley \u2022 4-minute read\n\nPosted in\n\n  * Infrastructure\n  * Telecommunications\n\n##### Related articles\n\nInfrastructure\n\n### Heita South Africa!
