Regrantors independently make\ngrant decisions, based on the goals of the original donor, and their own\nexpertise.\n\n### Our regrantors\n\n$700K\n\nEvan Hubinger\n\nAGI safety Research Scientist at Anthropic.

Ran EA @ Tufts, where I also studied math.\n\n### Why regranting?\n\n  * Regranting surfaces opportunities that donors and large grantmaking organizations might otherwise miss, as regrantors can tap into their personal networks and fields of expertise.\n  * The regranting model requires less overhead than traditional grantmaking, as one person is responsible for the budget rather than a committee. This allows for faster grant turnaround times, solving a key pain point for grantees.\n  * Certain cause areas like longtermism can be speculative, opaque, and nascent, making it harder for donors to know where to direct their money. Regranting allows donors to outsource these decisions to trustworthy individuals.\n\n### How does regranting on Manifund work?\n\nOur website makes the regranting process simple and transparent:\n\n  1. A donor contributes money to Manifold for Charity, a registered 501c3 nonprofit, when they add money to their Manifund account.\n  2. The donor can then allocate the money between regrantors of their choice (or they can give directly to projects).\n  3. Regrantors choose which opportunities, including projects posted on Manifund through our open call or projects they learn about elsewhere, to spend their budgets on, writing up an explanation for each grant made.\n  4. Manifold for Charity reviews the grant to make sure it is legitimate, legal, and aligned with our mission.\n  5. If we approve the grant, the money will be transferred to the grantee's Manifund account, at which point they request to withdraw and we send them their funds.\n\n### FAQ\n\nWho can see the information about grants?\n\nCurrently all grant information is made public. This includes the identity of\nthe regrantor and grant recipient, the project description, the grant size,\nand the regrantor\u2019s writeup.\n\nWe strongly believe in transparency as it allows for meaningful public\nfeedback, accountability of decisions, and establishment of a regrantor track\nrecords. We recognize that not all grants are suited for publishing; for now,\nwe recommend such grants be made through other funders, such as the Long Term\nFuture Fund, the Survival and Flourishing Fund, or Open Philanthropy.\n\nWhat kinds of projects are eligible for regranting?\n\nWe have no official cause-area restrictions on grants, though most of our\nregrantors are focused on mitigating global catastrophic risk.\n\nWe support regrants to registered charities and individuals. For-profit\norganizations may also be eligible, pending due diligence. As a US-registered\n501c3, we do not permit donations to political campaigns.\n\nWe will look over all grants before fulfilling withdrawal requests to make\nsure they meet these requirements. We reserve the right to veto grants for any\nreason, though will strongly defer to regrantors\u2019 judgement.\n\nCan regrantors send money to themselves?\n\nRegrantors are allowed to donate to their own projects, though we\u2019ll evaluate\nthese projects with more scrutiny before fulfilling withdrawal requests.\n\nHow do I become a regrantor?\n\nApply here!\n\n", "frontpage": false}
