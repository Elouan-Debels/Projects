This new policy will be applied to the Class of 2029 admissions\ncycle and will be formally assessed at regular intervals.\n\nFor the Class of 2029 admissions cycle, Harvard will require submission of\nscores for the SAT or ACT. In exceptional cases in which applicants are unable\nto access SAT or ACT testing, other eligible tests will be accepted.\n\nIn a message to the FAS community on Thursday, Edgerley Family Dean of the\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences Hopi Hoekstra foregrounded \u201ca number of factors\u201d\nthat underscored the decision.\n\n\u201cStandardized tests are a means for all students, regardless of their\nbackground and life experience, to provide information that is predictive of\nsuccess in college and beyond,\u201d she said. \u201cIndeed, when students have the\noption of not submitting their test scores, they may choose to withhold\ninformation that, when interpreted by the admissions committee in the context\nof the local norms of their school, could have potentially helped their\napplication. In short, more information, especially such strongly predictive\ninformation, is valuable for identifying talent from across the socioeconomic\nrange.\u201d\n\nIn research published last year, Harvard Professors Raj Chetty and David J.\nDeming and co-author John N. Friedman used data from more than 400\ninstitutions and about 3.5 million undergrads per year to better understand\nsocioeconomic diversity and admissions. Standardized tests emerged as an\nimportant tool to identify promising students at less-well-resourced high\nschools, particularly when paired with other academic credentials.\n\n\u201cCritics correctly note that standardized tests are not an unbiased measure of\nstudents\u2019 qualifications, as students from higher-income families often have\ngreater access to test prep and other resources,\u201d said Chetty, the William A.\nAckman Professor of Public Economics and director of Opportunity Insights.\n\u201cBut the data reveal that other measures \u2014 recommendation letters,\nextracurriculars, essays \u2014 are even more prone to such biases. Considering\nstandardized test scores is likely to make the admissions process at Harvard\nmore meritocratic while increasing socioeconomic diversity.\u201d\n\nDeming, the Kennedy School\u2019s Isabelle and Scott Black Professor of Political\nEconomy and a professor of education and economics at the Ed School, pointed\nto access as a key issue.\n\n\u201cThe virtue of standardized tests is their universality,\u201d he said. \u201cNot\neveryone can hire an expensive college coach to help them craft a personal\nessay. But everyone has the chance to ace the SAT or the ACT. While some\nbarriers do exist, the widespread availability of the test provides, in my\nview, the fairest admissions policy for disadvantaged applicants.\u201d\n\nIn June 2020, as the pandemic severely limited access to standardized testing,\nHarvard began a test-optional policy under which students could apply to the\nCollege without submitting scores. The admissions cycle for the Class of 2028\nwas the fourth for which students were able to apply without submitting test\nscores. However, admissions has welcomed applicants to submit test scores, and\nthe majority of those who matriculated during the past four years did so.\n\n\u201cTest scores can provide important information about a student\u2019s application,\u201d\nsaid William R. Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid. \u201cHowever,\nthey representonly one factor among many as our admissions committee considers\nthe whole person in making its decisions. Admissions officers understand that\nnot all students attend well-resourced schools, and those who come from modest\neconomic backgrounds or first-generation college families may have had fewer\nopportunities to prepare for standardized tests.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, nonprofits such as Khan Academy have offered robust test-prep\ntools at no charge. In her message, Hoekstra said that access to testing\nshould never prevent a student from applying to Harvard, and included\ninformation for those who may not be able to access the SAT or ACT, as well as\ntools such as Schoolhouse.world and other sources for no-cost tutoring and no-\ncost test preparation.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that in parts of the United States there may be fewer students\nthan in the past taking SAT or ACT for their state universities \u2014 and\ninternational applicants can also face barriers to testing,\u201d said Joy St.\nJohn, director of admissions. \u201cWe hope that promising students faced with such\nchallenges will still apply, using alternative forms of testing.\u201d\n\nSaid Hoekstra: \u201cFundamentally, we know that talent is universal, but\nopportunity is not. With this change, we hope to strengthen our ability to\nidentify these promising students, and to give Harvard the opportunity to\nsupport their development as thinkers and leaders who will contribute to\nshaping our world.\u201d\n\n#### Share this article\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Email article\n  * Print/PDF\n\n## You might like\n\n  * Campus & Community\n\n### Co-chairs of task forces share updates on community engagement\n\nLeaders of efforts to combat antisemitism and anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias\ndescribe what they\u2019ve heard so far from members of the Harvard community\n\nPart of the Israel-Gaza conflict series\n\nlong read\n\n  * Campus & Community\n\n### For all the other Willie Jacks\n\n\u2018Reservation Dogs\u2019 star Paulina Alexis offers behind-the-scenes glimpse of hit\nshow, details value of Native representation\n\n4 min read\n\n  * Campus & Community\n\n### Herbert Chanoch Kelman, 94\n\nMemorial Minute \u2014 Faculty of Arts and Sciences\n\n6 min read\n\n## Trending\n\n  1.
