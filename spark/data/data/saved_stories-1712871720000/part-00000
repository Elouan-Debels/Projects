Advances in matrix multiplication could lead to\nbreakthroughs in physics, engineering and computer science. AlphaTensor\nquickly rediscovered - and surpassed, for some cases - the reigning algorithm\ndiscovered by German mathematician Volker Strassen in 1969. However,\nmathematicians soon took inspiration from the results of the game-playing\nneural network to make advances of their own.
