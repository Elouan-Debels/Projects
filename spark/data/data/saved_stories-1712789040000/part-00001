Trailing by over $30,000,\nJennings, now the show\u2019s host, wrote out his Final Jeopardy answer in mock\nresignation: \u201cI, for one, welcome our computer overlords.\u201d\n\nA lark to some, the experience galvanized Satya Nitta, a longtime computer\nresearcher at IBM\u2019s Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.\nTasked with figuring out how to apply the supercomputer\u2019s powers to education,\nhe soon envisioned tackling ed tech\u2019s most sought-after challenge: the world\u2019s\nfirst tutoring system driven by artificial intelligence. It would offer truly\npersonalized instruction to any child with a laptop \u2014 no human required.\n\nYouTube\n\n\u201cI felt that they\u2019re ready to do something very grand in the space,\u201d he said\nin an interview.\n\nNitta persuaded his bosses to throw more than $100 million at the effort,\nbringing together 130 technologists, including 30 to 40 Ph.D.s, across\nresearch labs on four continents.\n\nRelated\n\n#### Wizard Chess, Robot Bikes and More: Six Students Creating Cool Stuff with\nAI\n\nBut by 2017, the tutoring moonshot was essentially dead, and Nitta had\nconcluded that effective, long-term, one-on-one tutoring is \u201ca terrible use of\nAI \u2014 and that remains today.\u201d\n\nFor all its jaw-dropping power, Watson the computer overlord was a weak\nteacher. It couldn\u2019t engage or motivate kids, inspire them to reach new\nheights or even keep them focused on the material \u2014 all qualities of the best\nmentors.\n\nIt\u2019s a finding with some resonance to our current moment of AI-inspired\ndoomscrolling about the future of humanity in a world of ascendant machines.\n\u201cThere are some things AI is actually very good for,\u201d Nitta said, \u201cbut it\u2019s\nnot great as a replacement for humans.\u201d\n\nHis five-year journey to essentially a dead-end could also prove instructive\nas ChatGPT and other programs like it fuel a renewed, multimillion-dollar\nexperiment to, in essence, prove him wrong.\n\nSome of the leading lights of ed tech, from Google to Microsoft, are trying to\npick up where Watson left off, offering AI tools that promise to help teach\nstudents. Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy, last year said AI has the\npotential to bring \u201cprobably the biggest positive transformation\u201d that\neducation has ever seen. He wants to give \u201cevery student on the planet an\nartificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor.\u201d\n\n### A 25-year journey\n\nTo be sure, research on high-dosage, one-on-one, in-person tutoring is\nunequivocal: It\u2019s one of the most powerful interventions available, offering\nsignificant improvement in students\u2019 academic performance, particularly in\nsubjects like math, reading and writing.\n\nBut traditional tutoring is also \u201cbreathtakingly expensive and hard to scale,\u201d\nsaid Paige Johnson, a vice president of education at Microsoft. One school\ndistrict in West Texas, for example, recently spent more than $5.6 million in\nfederal pandemic relief funds to tutor 6,000 students. The expense, Johnson\nsaid, puts it out of reach for most parents and school districts.\n\n> We missed something important. At the heart of education, at the heart of\n> any learning, is engagement.\n>\n> Satya Nitta, IBM Research\u2019s former global head of AI solutions for learning\n\nFor IBM, the opportunity to rebalance the equation in kids\u2019 favor was hard to\nresist.\n\nThe Watson lab is legendary in the computer science field, with six Nobel\nlaureates and six Turing Award winners among its ranks. It\u2019s where modern\nspeech recognition was invented, and home to countless other innovations such\nas barcodes and the magnetic stripes on credit cards that make ATMs possible.\nIt\u2019s also where, in 1997, Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov,\nessentially inventing the notion that AI could \u201cthink\u201d like a person.\n\nChess enthusiasts watch World Chess champion Garry Kasparov on a television\nmonitor as he holds his head in his hands at the start of the sixth and final\nmatch May 11, 1997 against IBM\u2019s Deep Blue computer in New York. Kasparov lost\nthis match in just 19 moves. (Stan Honda/Getty)\n\nThe heady atmosphere, Nitta recalled, inspired \u201ca very deep responsibility to\ndo something significant and not something trivial.\u201d\n\nWithin a few years of Watson\u2019s victory, Nitta, who had arrived in 2000 as a\nchip technologist, rose to become IBM Research\u2019s global head of AI solutions\nfor learning. For the Watson project, he said, \u201cI was just given a very open-\nended responsibility: Take Watson and do something with it in education.\u201d\n\nNitta spent a year simply reading up on how learning works. He studied\ncognitive science, neuroscience and the decades-long history of \u201cintelligent\ntutoring systems\u201d in academia. Foremost in his reading list was the research\nof Stanford neuroscientist Vinod Menon, who\u2019d put elementary schoolers through\na 12-week math tutoring session, collecting before-and-after scans of their\nbrains using an MRI. Tutoring, he found, produced nothing less than an\nincrease in neural connectivity.\n\nNitta returned to his bosses with the idea of an AI-powered cognitive tutor.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something I can do here that\u2019s very compelling,\u201d he recalled saying,\n\u201cthat can broadly transform learning itself. But it\u2019s a 25-year journey. It\u2019s\nnot a two-, three-, four-year journey.\u201d\n\nIBM drafted two of the highest-profile partners possible in education: the\nchildren\u2019s media powerhouse Sesame Workshop and Pearson, the international\npublisher.\n\nOne product Sesame envisioned was a voice-activated Elmo doll that would serve\nas a kind of digital tutoring companion, interacting fully with children.\nThrough brief conversations, it would assess their skills and provide spoken\nresponses to help kids advance.\n\nOne proposed application of IBM\u2019s planned Watson tutoring app was to create a\nvoice-activated Elmo doll that would be an interactive digital companion.\n(Getty)\n\nMeanwhile, Pearson promised that it could soon allow college students to\n\u201cdialogue with Watson in real time.\u201d\n\nNitta\u2019s team began designing lessons and putting them in front of students \u2014\nboth in classrooms and in the lab. In order to nurture a back-and-forth\nbetween student and machine, they didn\u2019t simply present kids with multiple-\nchoice questions, instead asking them to write responses in their own words.\n\nIt didn\u2019t go well.\n\nSome students engaged with the chatbot, Nitta said. \u201cOther students were just\nsaying, \u2018IDK\u2019 [I don\u2019t know]. So they simply weren\u2019t responding.\u201d Even those\nwho did began giving shorter and shorter answers.\n\nNitta and his team concluded that a cold reality lay at the heart of the\nproblem: For all its power, Watson was not very engaging. Perhaps as a result,\nit also showed \u201clittle to no discernible impact\u201d on learning. It wasn\u2019t just\ndull; it was ineffective.\n\nSatya Nitta (left) and part of his team at IBM\u2019s Watson Research Center, which\nspent five years trying to create an AI-powered interactive tutor using the\nWatson supercomputer.\n\n\u201cHuman conversation is very rich,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the back and forth between two\npeople, I\u2019m watching the evolution of your own worldview.\u201d The tutor\ninfluences the student \u2014 and vice versa. \u201cThere\u2019s this very shared\nunderstanding of the evolution of discourse that\u2019s very profound, actually. I\njust don\u2019t know how you can do that with a soulless bot. And I\u2019m a guy who\nworks in AI.\u201d\n\nWhen students\u2019 usage time dropped, \u201cwe had to be very honest about that,\u201d\nNitta said. \u201cAnd so we basically started saying, \u2018OK, I don\u2019t think this is\nactually correct. I don\u2019t think this idea \u2014 that an intelligent tutoring\nsystem will tutor all kids, everywhere, all the time \u2014 is correct.\u201d\n\n### \u2018We missed something important\u2019\n\nIBM soon switched gears, debuting another crowd-pleasing Watson variation \u2014\nthis time, a touching throwback: It engaged in Oxford-style debates. In a\ntelevised demonstration in 2019, it went up against debate champ Harish\nNatarajan on the topic \u201cShould we subsidize preschools?\u201d Among its arguments\nfor funding, the supercomputer offered, without a whiff of irony, that good\npreschools can prevent \u201cfuture crime.\u201d Its current iteration, Watsonx focuses\non helping businesses build AI applications like \u201cintelligent customer care.\u201d\n\nNitta left IBM, eventually taking several colleagues with him to create a\nstartup called Merlyn Mind. It uses voice-activated AI to safely help teachers\ndo workaday tasks such as updating digital gradebooks, opening PowerPoint\npresentations and emailing students and parents.\n\nThirteen years after Watson\u2019s stratospheric Jeopardy! victory and more than\none year into the Age of ChatGPT, Nitta\u2019s expectations about AI couldn\u2019t be\nmore down-to-earth: His AI powers what\u2019s basically \u201ca carefully designed\nassistant\u201d to fit into the flow of a teacher\u2019s day.\n\nTo be sure, AI can do sophisticated things such as generating quizzes from a\nclass reading and editing student writing. But the idea that a machine or a\nchatbot can actually teach as a human can, he said, represents \u201ca profound\nmisunderstanding of what AI is actually capable of.\u201d\n\nNitta, who still holds deep respect for the Watson lab, admits, \u201cWe missed\nsomething important. At the heart of education, at the heart of any learning,\nis engagement. And that\u2019s kind of the Holy Grail.\u201d\n\nThese notions aren\u2019t news to those who do tutoring for a living. Varsity\nTutors, which offers live and online tutoring in 500 school districts, relies\non AI to power a lesson plan creator that helps personalize instruction. But\nwhen it comes to the actual tutoring, humans deliver it, said Anthony Salcito,\nchief institution officer at Nerdy, which operates Varsity.\n\n\u201dThe AI isn\u2019t far enough along yet to do things like facial recognition and\nunderstanding of student focus,\u201d said Salcito, who spent 15 years at\nMicrosoft, most of them as vice president of worldwide education. \u201cOne of the\nthings that we hear from teachers is that the students love their tutors. I\u2019m\nnot sure we\u2019re at a point where students are going to love an AI agent.\u201d\n\n> Students love their tutors. I'm not sure we're at a point where students are\n> going to love an AI agent.\n>\n> Anthony Salcito, Nerdy\n\nThe No. 1 factor in a student\u2019s tutoring success is simply showing up\nconsistently, research suggests. As smart and efficient as an AI chatbot might\nbe, it\u2019s an open question whether most students, especially struggling ones,\nwould show up for an inanimate agent or develop a sense of respect for its\ntime.\n\nWhen Salcito thinks about what AI bots now do in education, he\u2019s not\nimpressed. Most, he said, \u201caren\u2019t going far enough to really rethink how\nlearning can take place.\u201d They end up simply as fast, spiffed-up search\nengines.\n\nRelated\n\n#### Q&A: Khan Academy\u2019s Sal Khan on COVID\u2019s Staggering Impact on Student Math\nSkills\n\nIn most cases, he said, the power of one-on-one, in-person tutoring often\nemerges as students begin to develop more honesty about their abilities,\nadvocate for themselves and, in a word, demand more of school. \u201cIn the\nclassroom, a student may say they understand a problem. But they come clean to\nthe tutor, where they expose, \u2018Hey, I need help.\u2019\u201d\n\nCognitive science suggests that for students who aren\u2019t motivated or who are\nuncertain about a topic, only one-on-one attention will help. That requires a\nfocused, caring human, watching carefully, asking tons of questions and\nreading students\u2019 cues.\n\nJeremy Roschelle, a learning scientist and executive director of Digital\nPromise, a federally funded research center, said usage with most ed tech\nproducts tends to drop off. \u201cKids get a little bored with it. It\u2019s not unique\nto tutors. There\u2019s a newness factor for students. They want the next new\nthing.\u201d\n\n> There's a newness factor for students. They want the next new thing.\n>\n> Jeremy Roschelle, Digital Promise\n\nEven now, Nitta points out, research shows that big commercial AI applications\ndon\u2019t seem to hold users\u2019 attention as well as top entertainment and social\nmedia sites like YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. One recent analysis dubbed the\nuser engagement of sites like ChatGPT \u201clackluster,\u201d finding that the\nproportion of monthly active users who engage with them in a single day was\nonly about 14%, suggesting that such sites aren\u2019t very \u201csticky\u201d for most\nusers.\n\nFor social media sites, by contrast, it\u2019s between 60% and 65%.\n\nOne notable AI exception: Character.ai, an app that allows users to create\ncompanions of their own among figures from history and fiction and chat with\nthe likes of Socrates and Bart Simpson. It has a stickiness score of 41%.\n\nRelated\n\n#### Learning Loss Win-Win: High-Impact Tutoring in DC Boosts Attendance,\nStudy Finds\n\nAs startups like Synthesis offer \u201cyour child\u2019s superhuman tutor,\u201d starting at\n$29 per month, and Khan Academy publicly tests its popular Khanmigo AI tool,\nNitta maintains that there\u2019s little evidence from learning science that,\nabsent a strong outside motivation, people will spend enough time with a\nchatbot to master a topic.\n\n\u201cWe are a very deeply social species,\u201d said Nitta, \u201cand we learn from each\nother.\u201d\n\nIBM declined to comment on its work in AI and education, as did Sesame\nWorkshop. A Pearson spokesman said that since last fall it has been beta-\ntesting AI study tools keyed to its e-textbooks, among other efforts, with\nplans this spring to expand the number of titles covered.\n\n### Getting \u2018unstuck\u2019\n\nIBM\u2019s experiences notwithstanding, the search for an AI tutor has continued\napace, this time with more players than just a legacy research lab in suburban\nNew York. Using the latest affordances of so-called large language models, or\nLLMs, technologists at Khan Academy believe they are finally making the first\nhalting steps in the direction of an effective AI tutor.\n\nKristen DiCerbo remembers the moment her mind began to change about AI.\n\nIt was September 2022, and she\u2019d only been at Khan Academy for a year-and-a-\nhalf when she and founder Khan got access to a beta version of ChatGPT. Open\nAI, ChatGPT\u2019s creator, had asked Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates for more\nfunding, but he told them not to come back until the chatbot could pass an\nAdvanced Placement biology exam.\n\nKhan Academy founder Sal Khan has said AI has the potential to bring \u201cprobably\nthe biggest positive transformation\u201d that education has ever seen. He wants to\ngive every student an \u201cartificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor.\u201d\n(Getty)\n\nSo Open AI queried Khan for sample AP biology questions. He and DiCerbo said\nthey\u2019d help in exchange for a peek at the bot \u2014 and a chance to work with the\nstartup. They were among the first people outside of Open AI to get their\nhands on GPT-4, the LLM that powers the upgraded version of ChatGPT. They were\nable to test out the AI and, in the process, become amateur AI prompt\nengineers before anyone had even heard of the term.\n\nLike many users typing in queries in those first heady days, the pair\ninitially just marveled at the sophistication of the tool and its ability to\nreturn what felt, for all the world, like personalized answers. With DiCerbo\nworking from her home in Phoenix and Khan from the nonprofit\u2019s Silicon Valley\noffice, they traded messages via Slack.\n\nKristen DiCerbo introduces users to Khanmigo in a Khan Academy promotional\nvideo. (YouTube)\n\n\u201cWe spent a couple of days just going back and forth, Sal and I, going, \u2018Oh my\ngosh, look what we did! Oh my gosh, look what it\u2019s saying \u2014 this is crazy!\u2019\u201d\nshe told an audience during a recent appearance at the University of Notre\nDame.\n\nShe recounted asking the AI to help write a mystery story in which shoes go\nmissing in an apartment complex. In the back of her mind, DiCerbo said, she\nplanned to make a dog the shoe thief, but didn\u2019t reveal that to ChatGPT. \u201cI\nstarted writing it, and it did the reveal,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt knew that I was\nthinking it was going to be a dog that did this, from just the little clues I\nwas planting along the way.\u201d\n\nMore tellingly, it seemed to do something Watson never could: have engaging\nconversations with students.\n\nDiCerbo recounted talking to a high school student they were working with who\ntold them about an interaction she\u2019d had with ChatGPT around The Great Gatsby.\nShe asked it about F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s famous green light across the bay,\nwhich scholars have long interpreted as symbolizing Jay Gatsby\u2019s out-of-reach\nhopes and dreams.\n\n\u201cIt comes back to her and asks, \u2018Do you have hopes and dreams just out of\nreach?\u2019\u201d DiCerbo recalled. \u201cIt had this whole conversation\u201d with the student.\n\nThe pair soon tore up their 2023 plans for Khan Academy.\n\nIt was a stunning turn of events for DiCerbo, a Ph.D. educational psychologist\nand former senior Pearson research scientist who had spent more than a year on\nthe failed Watson project. In 2016, Pearson had predicted that Watson would\nsoon be able to chat with college students in real time to guide them in their\nstudies. But it was DiCerbo\u2019s teammates, about 20 colleagues, who had to\nactually train the supercomputer on thousands of student-generated answers to\nquestions from textbooks \u2014 and tempt instructors to rate those answers.\n\nLike Nitta, DiCerbo recalled that at first things went well. They found a\nnatural science textbook with a large user base and set Watson to work. \u201cYou\nwould ask it a couple of questions and it would seem like it was doing what we\nwanted to,\u201d answering student questions via text.\n\nBut invariably if a student\u2019s question strayed from what the computer\nexpected, she said, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t know how to answer that. It had no ability to\nfreeform-answer questions, or it would do so in ways that didn\u2019t make any\nsense.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\n#### Oregon Trail Began 50 Years Ago in Minneapolis Classroom\n\nAfter more than a year of labor, she realized, \u201cI had never seen the \u2018OK, this\nis going to work\u2019 version\u201d of the hoped-for tutor. \u201cI was always at the \u2018OK, I\nhope the next version\u2019s better.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut when she got a taste of ChatGPT, DiCerbo immediately saw that, even in\nbeta form, the new bot was different. Using software that quickly predicted\nthe most likely next word in any conversation, ChatGPT was able to engage with\nits human counterpart in what seemed like a personal way.\n\nSince its debut in March 2023, Khanmigo has turned heads with what many users\nsay is a helpful, easy-to-use, natural language interface, though a few users\nhave pointed out that it sometimes gets math facts wrong.\n\nSurprisingly, DiCerbo doesn\u2019t consider the popular chatbot a full-time tutor.\nAs sophisticated as AI might now be in motivating students to, for instance,\ntry again when they make a mistake, \u201cIt\u2019s not a human,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also\nnot their friend.\u201d\n\n> (AI's) not a human. It\u2019s also not their friend.\n>\n> Kristen DiCerbo, Khan Academy\n\nKhan Academy\u2019s research shows their tool is effective with as little as 30\nminutes of practice and feedback per week. But even as many startups promise\nthe equivalent of a one-on-one human tutor, DiCerbo cautions that 30 minutes\nis not going to produce miracles. Khanmigo, she said, \u201cis not a solution\nthat\u2019s going to replace a human in your life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool in your\ntoolbox that can help you get unstuck.\u201d\n\n### \u2018A couple of million years of human evolution\u2019\n\nFor his part, Nitta says that for all the progress in AI, he\u2019s not persuaded\nthat we\u2019re any closer to a real-live tutor that would offer long-term help to\nmost students. If anything, Khanmigo and probabilistic tools like it may prove\nto be effective \u201chomework helpers.\u201d But that\u2019s where he draws the line.\n\n\u201cI have no problem calling it that, but don\u2019t call it a tutor,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to endow it with human-like capabilities when there are none.\u201d\n\nUnlike humans, who will typically do their best to respond genuinely to a\nquestion, the way AI bots work \u2014by digesting pre-existing texts and other\ninformation to come up with responses that seem human \u2014 is akin to a\n\u201cstatistical illusion,\u201d writes Harvard Business School Professor Karim\nLakhani. \u201cThey\u2019ve just been well-trained by humans to respond to humans.\u201d\n\nResearcher Sidney Pressey\u2019s 1928 Testing Machine, one of a series of so-called\n\u201cteaching machines\u201d that he and others believed would advance education\nthrough automation.\n\nLargely because of this, Nitta said, there\u2019s little evidence that a chatbot\nwill continuously engage people as a good human tutor would.\n\nWhat would change his mind? Several years of research by an independent third\nparty showing that tools like Khanmigo actually make a difference on a large\nscale \u2014 something that doesn\u2019t exist yet.\n\nDiCerbo also maintains her hard-won skepticism. She knows all about the\nhalting early decades of computers a century ago, when experimental, punch-\ncard operated \u201cteaching machines\u201d guided students through rudimentary\nmultiple-choice lessons, often with simple rewards at the end.\n\nIn her talks, DiCerbo urges caution about AI revolutionizing education. As\nmuch as anyone, she is aware of the expensive failures that have come before.\n\nTwo women stand beside open drawers of computer punch card filing cabinets.\n(American Stock/Getty Images)\n\nIn her recent talk at Notre Dame, she did her best to manage expectations of\nthe new AI, which seems so limitless. In one-to-one teaching, she said,\nthere\u2019s an element of humanity \u201cthat we have not been able to \u2014 and probably\nshould not try \u2014 to replicate in artificial intelligence.\u201d In that respect,\nshe\u2019s in agreement with Nitta: Human relationships are key to learning. In the\ntalk, she noted that students who have a person in school who cares about\ntheir learning have higher graduation rates.\n\nBut still.\n\nChatGPT now has 100 million weekly users, according to Open AI. That record-\nfast uptake makes her think \u201cthere\u2019s something interesting and sticky about\nthis for people that we haven\u2019t seen in other places.\u201d\n\nBeing able to engineer prompts in plain English opens the door for more\npeople, not just engineers, to create tools quickly and iterate on what works,\nshe said. That democratization could mean the difference between another\nfailed promise and agile tools that actually deliver at least a version of\nWatson\u2019s promise.\n\nAn early prototype of IBM\u2019s Watson supercomputer in Yorktown Heights, New\nYork. In 2011, the system was the size of a master bedroom. (Wikimedia\nCommons)\n\nSeven years after he left IBM to start his new endeavor, Nitta is\nphilosophical about the effort. He takes virtually full responsibility for the\nfailure of the Watson moonshot. In retrospect, even his 25-year timeline for\nsuccess may have been naive.\n\n\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t appreciate is, I actually was stepping into a couple of million\nyears of human evolution,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing I didn\u2019t appreciate at\nthe time, which I do in the fullness of time: Mistakes happen at various\nlevels, but this was an important one.\u201d\n\nGet stories like these delivered straight to your inbox.
