Indeed, you will NOT have\nseen one of these before. There are three wheels with massive balloon tires\ninside a proprietary monotrack system, a big battery and an electric motor\nwith oodles of grunt. The Oruga is designed for non-expert ease-of-use in very\nrugged conditions: very steep hills, snow, mud, sand.\n\nThe Oruga Unitrack is set to be one of the stars of TechChill 2024, the annual\ntechnology and startup conference beginning tomorrow (April 18-19, 2024) in\nRiga, Latvia.\n\nMore Stories\n\nArchitecture\n\nCarbon-capturing concrete walls conceal a quirky Japanese house\n\nOutdoors\n\nAcoustic navigational tech gets scuba divers using GPS maps\n\nOruga SIA is a Mobility Tech startup established in Latvia in the summer of\n2023, with the Oruga name derived from the Spanish word for caterpillar.\n\nThe company\u2019s point of difference is its proprietary patent-pending monotrack\ntechnology and the company intends to develop and manufacture products\n\u201cdesigned to conquer diverse challenging terrains: from hot sand and muddy\nforests to rocky climbs and snowy landscapes.\u201d\n\nThe Oruga Unitrack is unlikely to be mistaken for any other vehicle. Its\nunique architecture certainly gets the mind working. An initial run of 100\nmodels is planned to begin in 2025, though pricing and details are not yet\navailable.\n\nOruga / New Atlas\n\nOruga\u2019s headquarters is located in Latvia\u2019s capitol, Riga, and the first batch\nof 100 Unitracks will be manufactured in Latvia beginning in mid-2025 and sold\nonline, with pre-orders being taken now.\n\nClearly there are more applications of the monotrack technology that we have\nyet to see, but we\u2019ve been looking at these images for a while, and we\u2019re not\nquite sure how it steers, so we\u2019ve reached out and will update this story as\nsoon as we get a response.\n\nOur best guess is that the top wheel turns in that axle groove, bending the\ntrack around slightly \u2013 but if that's the case it must be the first steering\nsystem we've seen that turns a wheel that's a foot off the ground!\n\nNow most of the adventures that the Oruga Unitrack appears to have been built\nfor are already catered to in the marketplace by motorcycle industry veteran\nRokon.\n\nRokon has catered to this niche since 1957 and although it offers a meager\nseven horsepower, the Rokon\u2019s two-wheel-drive system and those huge balloon\ntires combine with an automatic gearbox to get you to all those same obscure\nplaces the Oruga Unitrack is destined for. Rokon has a range of models ranging\nfrom all-round pack mules to the mototractor for the man on the land, with\nspecial editions for preppers and hunters.\n\nThe full capabilities and the numbers behind the Oruga Unitrack are still\nunknown, but it clearly has some advantages over the 200cc four-stroke Rokon\nin that it offers an eco-conscious tool for paramedics, first responders and\nthe military. Ecological responsibility is not of paramount concern for the\nmilitary, but the off-road mobility offered by the Oruga Unitrack is also\ncompletely silent.\n\nOruga\n\nWe\u2019ll wait until we have more details, but while this might be a niche\nproduct, the prosperity of Rokon and its dedicated legion of followers has\nalready demonstrated the need for a product just like this.\n\nIt\u2019s the capabilities of the bike that will decide its fate, with how it\nrides, but that third wheel sticking up at the front like a unicorn\u2019s horn\nreally does have me intrigued.\n\nI\u2019ve been riding off-road bikes for more than 40 years, and I bet there are a\nfew like me wondering about the positioning of the higher front wheel and at\nwhat angles it becomes engaged with mother earth, and ... anyway, I\u2019ll suspend\ndisbelief until I\u2019ve either thrown a leg over one, or spoken to someone who\nhas.\n\nMore details as soon as we have them.\n\nSource: Oruga\n\nView gallery - 4 images\n\n## Tags\n\nOutdoorsOruga Unitrack ATVMotorcycleElectric VehiclesTracked\nVehiclesSnowmobiles\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * LinkedIn\n\n1 comment\n\nMike Hanlon\n\nAs a photojournalist, Mike\u2019s work has been published in a dozen languages\nacross 20+ countries.
