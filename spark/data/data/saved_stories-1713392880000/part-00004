The finding could one day\nbe harnessed in ultrafast computing memory, the researchers say.\n\nThe scientists formulated a new equation that describes the link between the\namplitude of the magnetic field of light, its frequency and the energy\nabsorption properties of a magnetic material. The scientists published their\nfindings in a study on Jan. 3 in the journal Physical Review Research.\n\nThe equation is \"completely new and also very elemental,\" study co-author Amir\nCapua, a physics professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Live\nScience.\n\nAlthough the discovery builds on the field known as \"magneto-optics,\" this\nrepresents a new paradigm because scientists didn't previously understand that\nthe magnetic component of a rapidly oscillating light wave can control\nmagnets, he said. The equation describes the characteristics of this\ninteraction.\n\nComputer memory uses miniature electromagnets that are magnetized with voltage\nto enable the binary states of \"on\" or \"off\" to encode data, which are read\nand reinterpreted by a processor as 1 or 0.\n\nThe most common computing memory, like those found in laptops or phones, comes\nin the form of dynamic random access memory (DRAM). This is volatile, meaning\nwhen power is switched off, all data held is lost, but it's easier to\nengineer, uses common materials and has low error rates \u2014 and those few errors\nare easy to detect and fix.\n\nThe new finding is more relevant for a technology called magnetoresistive\nrandom access memory (MRAM), which is a non-volatile memory more commonly used\nin spacecraft as well as military and other industrial applications, according\nto MRAM-info.\n\n## Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy\nPolicy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRelated: 'Universal memory' breakthrough brings the next generation of\ncomputers 1 step closer to major speed boost\n\nInteraction between a magnetic material and radiation is well established when\nthey are in equilibrium, but less is known about this relationship when they\nare not in equilibrium. It's also an area that overlaps with the weird laws of\nquantum mechanics, which are being harnessed to build quantum computers.\n\n\"We've arrived at a very elementary equation describing this interaction. It\nlets us completely reconsider optical magnetic recording and navigate our way\nto a dense, energy-efficient, cost-efficient optical magnetic storage device\nthat doesn't even exist yet,\" Capua said.\n\nPrevious efforts to use the magnetic component of a light beam to flip a\nmagnetic bit in this way were not effective, Capua said. But the new equation\ncould help researchers to successfully incorporate the mechanism, he said.\n\nIn the far future, this technology could lead to MRAM components that are\nfaster and more efficient than today's state-of-the-art RAM units, he added.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n\u2014World's 1st graphene semiconductor could power future quantum computers\n\n\u2014Computing 'paradigm shift' could see phones and laptops run twice as fast \u2014\nwithout replacing a single component\n\n\u2014World's 1st PC rediscovered by accident in UK house clearance nearly 50 years\nafter last sighting\n\nOptical cycle times (the time for an optical electromagnetic wave to complete\nan oscillation, in megahertz) in the technology could be a million times\nfaster than in conventional memory. Electrical cycle times operate on\nnanoscale timescales (a second is 1 billion nanoseconds) whereas typical\noptical beams work in picoseconds (a second is 1 trillion seconds).\n\nIt may also one day lead to quantum memory for quantum computers, in which a\nbeam of light can fix a magnetic bit in neither 0 nor 1 but a superposition of\nthe two states \u2014 much like how qubits work in quantum computers. Even though\nthat's beyond the precision engineering of today, Capua said his team's\nfindings could lead to the discovery of materials that could one day be used\nin such technology.\n\nIt can also make digitized memory systems more energy-efficient by giving the\ndevice more control over the strength and duration of the light beam and its\neffects. \"The duration of the optical beam and its energy can be chosen to\nreduce the writing power. Obviously, when the device is idle it doesn't\nconsume any energy since magnetic memories are nonvolatile,\" he said.\n\nDrew Turney\n\nDrew is a freelance science and technology journalist with 20 years of\nexperience.
