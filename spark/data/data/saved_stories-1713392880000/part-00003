Brown archive page\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nWashington, DC, was hot and humid on June 23, 1993, but no one was sweating\nmore than Daniel Goldin, the administrator of NASA. Standing outside the House\nchamber, he watched nervously as votes registered on the electronic tally\nboard. The space station wasn\u2019t going to make it. The United States had spent\nmore than $11 billion on it by then, with thousands of pounds of paperwork to\nshow for it\u2014but zero pounds of flight hardware. Whether there would ever be a\nstation came down, now, to a cancellation vote on the House floor.\n\nPolitically, the space station was something of a wayward orphan. It was a\nnine-year-old Reagan administration initiative, expanded by George H.W. Bush\nas the centerpiece of a would-be return to the moon and an attempt to reach\nMars. When voters replaced Bush with Bill Clinton, Goldin persuaded the new\npresident to keep the station by pitching it as a post-Soviet reconstruction\neffort. The Russians were great at building stations, which would save NASA a\nfortune in R&D. In turn, NASA\u2019s funding would keep Russian rocket scientists\nemployed\u2014and less likely to freelance for hostile foreign powers. Still,\ndissatisfaction with NASA was a bipartisan affair: everyone seemed to agree\nthat the agency was bloated and ossified. Representative Tim Roemer, a\nDemocrat from Indiana, wanted to make some big changes, and he introduced an\namendment to the NASA authorization bill to kill the station once and for all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoldin had made more than 100 phone calls in the day and a half before the\nvote, hoping to sway lawmakers to endorse the station, which he saw as\ncritical for studying biomedicine, electronics, materials engineering, and the\nhuman body in a completely alien environment: microgravity. Things down to the\nmolecular level behave profoundly differently in space, and flying experiments\na week at a time on the shuttle wasn\u2019t enough to learn much. Real research\nrequired a permanent presence in space, and that meant a space station.\n\nSupporters of the space station had gone into the vote expecting to win. Not\nby much\u201420 votes, maybe. But the longer the vote went on, the closer it got.\nEach side began cheering as it pulled ahead. The 110 new members of Congress,\nnone of whom had ever before cast a vote involving the station, revealed\nthemselves to be less reliable than expected.\n\nFinally, the tally reached 215\u2013215, with one vote remaining: Representative\nJohn Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights legend. As Lewis walked down the hall\ntoward the legislative chamber, Goldin\u2019s legislative aide, Jeff Lawrence, told\nthe administrator to say something\u2014anything\u2014to win him over. As Lewis walked\nby, Goldin had only one second, maybe two, and the best he could get out was a\nraw, honest, \u201cCongressman Lewis, the future of the space program depends on\nyou.\u201d He added: \u201cThe nation is counting on you. How will you vote?\u201d\n\n## Related Story\n\nInside NASA\u2019s bid to make spacecraft as small as possible\n\nWhen it comes to exploring the solar system, we must grapple with the hard\nlimits of physics.\n\nLewis smiled as he walked by. He said, \u201cI ain\u2019t telling you.\u201d\n\nThe station, later named the International Space Station, survived by his\nsingle vote, 216\u2013215. Five years later, Russia launched the first module from\nKazakhstan, and since November 2000, not a single day has elapsed without a\nhuman being in space.\n\nNASA designed the International Space Station to fly for 20 years. It has\nlasted six years longer than that, though it is showing its age, and NASA is\ncurrently studying how to safely destroy the space laboratory by around 2030.\nThis will involve a \u201cdeorbit vehicle\u201d docking with the ISS, which is the size\nof a football field (including end zones), and firing thrusters so that the\nstation, which circles the Earth at five miles per second, slams down squarely\nin the middle of the Pacific Ocean, avoiding land, injury, and the loss of\nhuman life.\n\nAs the scorched remains of the station sink to the bottom of the sea, however,\nthe story of America in low Earth orbit (LEO) will continue. The ISS never\nreally became what some had hoped: a launching point for an expanding human\npresence in the solar system. But it did enable fundamental research on\nmaterials and medicine, and it helped us start to understand how space affects\nthe human body. To build on that work, NASA has partnered with private\ncompanies to develop new, commercial space stations for research,\nmanufacturing, and tourism. If they are successful, these companies will bring\nabout a new era of space exploration: private rockets flying to private\ndestinations. They will also demonstrate a new model in which NASA builds\ninfrastructure and the private sector takes it from there, freeing the agency\nto explore deeper and deeper into space, where the process can be repeated.\nThey\u2019re already planning to do it around the moon. One day, Mars could follow.\n\nFrom the dawn of the space age, space stations were envisioned as essential to\nleaving Earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1952, Wernher von Braun, the primary architect of the American space\nprogram, called them \u201cas inevitable as the rising of the sun\u201d and said they\u2019d\nbe integral to any sustainable exploration program, mitigating cost and\ncomplexity. Indeed, he proposed building a space station before a moon or Mars\nprogram, so that expeditions would have a logistical way station for resupply\nand refueling.\n\n\u201cGoing into the 1960s, there\u2019s a lot of consensus and momentum around the idea\nthat space is going to be a three-step process,\u201d says historian David Hitt,\ncoauthor of Homesteading Space: The Skylab Story. Step one, he told me, is\ntransportation. You\u2019ve got to leave Earth somehow, which means developing the\ninfrastructure to build human-safe rockets and launching them. Step two is\nhabitation. You need a place to live once you are in space\u2014for its own sake as\na science laboratory, and also as a logistical waypoint between Earth and\nother celestial objects. \u201cOnce you have transportation and habitation,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cyou can take your next step, which is exploration.\u201d\n\nThe mindset changed after the Soviet Union beat the United States to orbit,\nfirst with its Sputnik I satellite in 1957 and again when cosmonaut Yuri\nGagarin became the first man in space in 1961. President John F. Kennedy\ncommitted the nation to landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to\nEarth \u201cbefore this decade is out.\u201d It was an outrageously ambitious goal,\ngiven that NASA had only managed to launch a human to space three weeks\nearlier. \u201cIt required moving quickly, and the way you do that is to take the\nthree-step plan and get rid of step two,\u201d Hitt told me. \u201cAs it turned out, if\nyou skip the habitation stage, it works\u2014the US got to the moon, but did so in\na way that did not lay the groundwork for the long-term sustainability of the\nprogram.\u201d\n\n> \u201cEven going back to the Mercury program, the goal was always the moon.\n> Skylab is the first time that space itself became the destination.\u201d\n>\n> David Hitt, historian\n\nWe are still working on that. Two years after the final Apollo mission, NASA\nlaunched the first American space station, Skylab. Adapted from the second\nstage of a Saturn V moon rocket, it was enormous: 99 feet (30 meters) long and\nby far the heaviest spacecraft ever launched. NASA would eventually launch\nthree missions of three astronauts each to the station, where they would\nperform more than a hundred experiments.\n\n\u201cIn a very real way, Skylab was the first American space mission,\u201d Hitt says.\n\u201cBefore Skylab, we were flying moon missions\u2014even going back to the Mercury\nprogram, the goal was always the moon. Skylab is the first time that space\nitself became the destination.\u201d Its goals were foundational to what would\nlater come. \u201cThe big thing that Skylab taught us is that human beings can, in\nfact, live and work long durations in a space environment. If we\u2019re serious\nabout going to Mars, you [may] spend way longer in space than you\u2019re going to\nspend on the Martian surface.\u201d\n\nSkylab remains the only space station built and launched solely by the United\nStates. In 1986, the Soviet Union launched the first module of Mir, a modular\nspace station built like Lego blocks, one segment at a time. Because NASA had\ndiscontinued the Saturn V rocket, the agency necessarily adopted the same\nmodular station model, eventually partnering with Russia and other countries\nto build the ISS. Today it shares the skies with Tiangong, China\u2019s permanent\nspace station, the first module of which launched in 2021. None of these\nstations have acted as moon or Mars way stations in the von Braun mold; to\nsatisfy that requirement, NASA is developing a future station called Gateway\nthat is intended to orbit the moon. Its first module could launch next year.\n\nAlthough they never became transportation hubs, each space station has\nadvanced the critical cause of learning what long stretches of space do to the\nhuman body. (Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who flew on Mir, holds the\nall-time record for continuous spaceflight, with 437 days.) Researchers still\nhave a relative paucity of knowledge about how the body responds to space. On\nEarth, we have the collective experience of more than 100 billion human beings\nacross 300,000 years, and still much about the human body remains a mystery.\nWhy do we yawn? What should we eat? Fewer than a thousand people in 63 years\nhave ever been to space. Such studies can only occur on permanent space\nstations.\n\n\u201cDuring the shuttle program, we were studying the effects of just a shorter-\nduration spaceflight\u2014a couple weeks\u2014on the human body,\u201d Steven Platts, chief\nscientist of NASA\u2019s Human Research Program, told me. Among the problems was\n\u201corthostatic intolerance,\u201d which is the body\u2019s inability to regulate blood\npressure. It affected about a quarter of crew members who returned from space.\nOnce NASA and Russia launched the ISS and spaceflight durations increased from\nweeks to months, that number leaped to 80%. \u201cWe spent a lot of time trying to\ntease out that mechanism. And we eventually came up with countermeasures so\nthat that risk is now considered closed,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther challenges include spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome, which\nis a change in the structure and function of the eye, something researchers\nidentified about 10 years ago. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really see it with the shuttle, but\nas we started doing more and more station missions, we saw it,\u201d Platts says.\nThey have also identified small, structural changes in the brain but have yet\nto figure out what that means in the long term: \u201cThat\u2019s a relatively new risk\nthat we didn\u2019t know about before the space station.\u201d\n\nOverall, he says, the ability of the human body to regulate its function in\nspace is \u201camazing.\u201d His group is working on about 30 risks to humans posed by\nspace exploration, which it classifies in a color-coding scheme. Green issues\nare well controlled. Yellow risks are of moderate concern, and red ones must\nbe solved before missions are possible. \u201cRight now, for low Earth orbit there\nare no red. Everything is yellow and green. We understand it pretty well and\nwe can deal with it. But as we get to lunar, we see more yellow and some red,\nand as we get to Mars, we see more red yet,\u201d Platts says. \u201cThere are things\nthat we know right now are a problem, and we\u2019re working hard to try and figure\nthem out, either from a research standpoint or an engineering standpoint.\u201d\n\nSome problems can only be studied as we venture farther into space\u2014the long-\nterm effects of Mars dust on the human body, for example. Others, such as the\nunanticipated development of psychiatric disorders, can be studied closer to\nhome.\n\nNASA and other institutions are currently studying all this on the ISS and\nwill need to continue such research long beyond the space station\u2019s\nretirement\u2014one reason why it is imperative that someone else launch a\nsuccessor space station, and soon. To that end, just as it did with SpaceX\nfrom 2006 through 2011, the agency has seeded several companies with small\ninvestments, promising to lease space on emergent space stations. And right\nnow, the soonest likely to launch is being led out of a sprawling former Fry\u2019s\nElectronics retail store in a shopping center complex in Texas.\n\nI met Michael Baine, the chief technology officer of Axiom Space, on a gray,\ndrizzly January morning at the entrance to its Space Station Development\nFacility in Houston. Baine began his career at NASA Johnson Space Center just\ndown the road, where he worked on everything from the shuttle and station to\nexperimental lunar landers. Later, he left the agency to join Intuitive\nMachines as its chief of engineering. In February, that company\u2019s Nova-C\nspacecraft, Odysseus, became the first US spacecraft to land successfully on\nthe moon since the end of the Apollo program in 1972, making Intuitive\nMachines the first private company to land successfully on a celestial object\nbeyond Earth. Baine has worked at Axiom Space since 2016. The startup\u2019s long-\nterm goal is to build the first private commercial space station. It has\nsuccessfully organized and managed three private missions to the International\nSpace Station, in large part to study firsthand how humans work and live in\nspace, so that they might design a more user-friendly product.\n\nAxiom is not the only company interested in launching private space stations.\nMost notably, Blue Origin announced in 2021 that in partnership with the\naerospace outfit Sierra Nevada, it would build Orbital Reef, a \u201cmixed-use\nbusiness park\u201d capable of supporting up to 10 people simultaneously in low\nEarth orbit. In January, Sierra Nevada successfully stress-tested a one-third-\nscale test article of its habitat module, with the intention of launching a\nstation into orbit on a Blue Origin New Glenn rocket in 2027. Other companies,\nsuch as Lockheed Martin, have made moves into the market, though their\nprogress is less clear.\n\nAxiom plans to build its own orbital facility much differently, Baine told me\nas we entered the facility. Suspended from the wall above, large, low-fidelity\nmodels of spacecraft hung from the ceiling, including the X-38 (an\nexperimental emergency return vehicle for space station crew) and Zvezda, the\nRussian module of the ISS, which today is plagued by age-induced stress\nfractures and consequent leaks. Crew vehicles no longer dock with it.\n\nMichael Baine, the chief technology officer of Axiom Space, began his career\nat NASA Johnson Space Center.\n\nANTHONY RATHBUN\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to build a full, self-sustaining space station and launch\nit in one shot,\u201d Baine said as we walked past an open-concept cube farm\nbeneath the models, where about 500 men and women are designing a space\nstation to replace Zvezda and the rest of the ISS. \u201cWhat you want to do is\nassemble it in space in a piecemeal fashion. The easiest way to do that is to\nstart with something that is already there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201csomething\u201d is the International Space Station itself. In 2026, Baine\nexpects to launch Axiom Hab One, a cylindrical module with crew quarters and\nmanufacturing capabilities that will plug into an open port on the ISS. Later,\nAxiom plans to launch Hab Two, expanding habitation, scientific, and\nmanufacturing services. Then it hopes to launch a research and manufacturing\nfacility, complete with a spacious, fully glassed cupola to give Axiom\nastronauts and visitors on the station access to a complete view of planet\nEarth, as well as the length of the station. Finally, the company intends to\nlaunch a \u201cpower thermal module\u201d with massive solar panels, expanded life\nsupport capabilities, and payload capacity.\n\n> \u201cWe wanted to turn over the keys to the shuttle, the station\u2014all that\u2014to the\n> private sector.\u201d\n>\n> Lori Garver, former deputy administrator of NASA\n\nEach new segment is designed to plug into the preceding Axiom segment. This\nisn\u2019t aspirational; there is a hard deadline in effect. Unless the ISS gets a\nnew lease on life, everything must be launched and assembled by 2030. Once\nNASA officially declares the ISS mission completed, the Lego-like Axiom\nStation will detach from the ISS as its own integrated and fully self-\nsustaining space station. Afterward, the deorbit vehicle will do its job and\npush the ISS into the ocean.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big risk reduction for us to be able to use ISS as a staging point to\nbuild up our capability one element at a time,\u201d Baine explains. That plan also\noffers a huge commercial advantage. There is already a robust, global user\nbase of companies and researchers sending projects to the ISS. \u201cIn order to\ncourt those users to migrate to a commercial solution, it just becomes easier\nif you\u2019re already at a location where they\u2019re at,\u201d he says. Everything from\ntechnical interfaces to the way Axiom Station will handle the outgassing of\nmaterials will be compatible with existing ISS hardware: \u201cWe have to meet the\nsame standards that NASA does.\u201d\n\nThe Axiom Station Earth Observatory module will allow astronauts a 360-degree\nview of their surroundings.\n\nANTHONY RATHBUN\n\nA lot of people are betting that there are fortunes to be made in LEO, and\nbecause of that, the US taxpayer is not paying for Axiom Station. Though NASA\nintends to eventually rent space on Hab One, and has already awarded tens of\nmillions of dollars to kick off early development, the commercial station is\nbeing built by hundreds of millions of private dollars. The cultivation of\ncommercial research and manufacturing is ongoing, which was NASA\u2019s aim going\nall the way back to Dan Goldin\u2019s tenure as administrator.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to turn over the keys to the shuttle, the station\u2014all that\u2014to the\nprivate sector,\u201d says Lori Garver, a former deputy administrator of NASA and\nauthor of Escaping Gravity. \u201cDan believed if we could hand over low-Earth-\norbit infrastructure, NASA could go farther into space, and I really bought\ninto that.\u201d Garver would later pioneer the commercial spaceflight model that\nled SpaceX and other companies to take over launch services, saving the agency\ntens of billions of dollars while simultaneously speeding launch cadence\u2014the\nsame model that led to Axiom\u2019s space station work.\n\n## Related Story\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the moon\n\nRobots\u2014and then humans\u2014are going back to the lunar surface. Here\u2019s what\nthey\u2019ll be doing.\n\n\u201cAfter launching the first module in 1998, we announced that space was open\nfor business,\u201d Garver told me. The first person to reach out was Fisk Johnson,\nof S.C. Johnson & Son. He wanted to work with NASA to develop a bioreactor to\nhelp create new pharmaceuticals for liver disease in a microgravity\nenvironment. \u201cI worked with him for probably three years at NASA,\u201d Garver\nsays. \u201cUnfortunately, their flight mission was Columbia, and we lost the\nexperiment in the tragedy.\u201d\n\nIn the decades to follow, commercial research and development would increase,\nwith limitations. NASA, Russia, and the other partner nations did not design\nthe ISS specifically as a large-scale research and manufacturing facility, and\none reason no company has elected to simply buy the station outright is that\nrefurbishing it would be more complex and expensive than either building a new\nstation, as Axiom has elected to do, or renting space on a modern successor.\n\nAs we came upon a stunning, full-scale mock-up of Hab One at the far end of\nthe building, I asked Baine if starting with the technical solutions already\ndeveloped by NASA\u2014the way environmental systems work, for example\u2014makes Axiom\nStation easier from an engineering perspective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA mock-up of an Axiom station module interior.\n\nANTHONY RATHBUN\n\n\u201cYou would think so,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut these are very demanding standards, and\nthey require a lot of attention to detail.\u201d The voluminous testing and\nanalyses to prove that you meet the requirements necessary to interface with\nISS generate a lot of work, \u201cbut you end up with a structure or a component\nthat is extremely reliable. The chances that a failure could propagate to a\nloss of crew is very, very remote.\u201d\n\nOnly looking at the mock-up did I realize the immensity of the spacecraft. It\nis 15 feet (4.6 meters) at its widest, and 36 feet long. Once docked with the\nISS, Hab One, which weighs 30 metric tons on Earth and can support four\nastronauts, will be the longest element on the station.\n\n> \u201cIt is a spaceship-in-the-bottle problem. You basically have to feed all\n> your systems through a 50-inch hatch.\u201d\n>\n> Michael Baine, chief technology officer, Axiom Space\n\nHere at the Space Station Development Facility, the entire mock-up is made of\nCNC-machined wood. But the module is much further along than the existence of\na \u201cmock-up stage\u201d would suggest. Its pressure vessel (that is, its primary\nshell, which holds air and maintains an Earth-like pressure environment in the\nvacuum of space) and its hatches are essentially completed and will soon be\nshipped from Italy by the same contractor that built many modules of the ISS.\nBaine walked me through a partitioned facility where Axiom Station\u2019s avionics,\npropulsion, life support systems, communications, and other subsystems are\nwell into development. Befitting the former Fry\u2019s Electronics building in\nwhich we stood, there was a home-brew element to the systems, many of which\nwere strewn across tables\u2014an elaborate web of wires, tubes, circuit boards,\nand chips. The station will run on Linux.\n\nAxiom built the mock-up to solve an almost comically fundamental challenge\nthat any project such as this faces: turning the pressure shell and the myriad\nsubsystems and components into a human-safe spacefaring vehicle. You can\u2019t\njust drill holes in the pressure shell, any more than you can punch a hole in\na balloon and expect it to keep its shape. Axiom must build the module inside\nand around it. \u201cIt is a spaceship-in-the-bottle problem,\u201d Baine said. \u201cYou\nbasically have to feed all your systems through a 50-inch hatch and integrate\nthem into the element.\u201d He calls it one of the hardest problems in the\nbusiness, because it\u2019s about more than assembling systems inside a pressure\nshell in Houston\u2014it\u2019s also about making the station user friendly for\nservicing in orbit, if ever a technical issue arises.\n\nAxiom\u2019s R&D facility is housed in a sprawling former Fry\u2019s Electronics retail\nstore in a shopping center complex.\n\nANTHONY RATHBUN\n\nA mock-up of Axiom\u2019s Habitat One (Hab One), which will include crew quarters\nand manufacturing capabilities.\n\nANTHONY RATHBUN\n\nToday, tourism and research are probably the best-known uses of private\nspaceflight. But Axiom has other functions in mind for the station, including\nserving as a destination for countries that have yet to get involved in\nsending humans to space. Last year, the company announced the Axiom Space\nAccess Program, which Tejpaul Bhatia, the company\u2019s chief revenue officer,\ndescribed as a \u201cspace program in a box\u201d for countries around the world. Axiom\nsays the program is evolving, but that it is a pathway for space\nparticipation. Azerbaijan was the first country to sign on.\n\nBut one of the most promising business prospects for the immediate future is\nmanufacturing. Low Earth orbit is an especially good environment for making\nthings in three areas: pharmaceuticals, metallurgy, and optics. Microgravity\neliminates a number of physical phenomena that can interfere with sensitive\nsteps in manufacturing processes, yielding more consistent material properties\nand structures. Axiom and Blue Origin are betting that modern space stations\nbuilt around the insights gleaned from decades of ISS experimentation (but\nfreed of its 1980s and 1990s technology) will pay dividends.\n\nAs part of its push to encourage companies to develop their own space\nstations, NASA has committed to leasing space on those that meet the agency\u2019s\nstringent human-spaceflight requirements. Just as with a major shopping\ncenter, an \u201canchor tenant\u201d can offer financial stability and attract more\ntenants. To help this along, a US national laboratory based in Melbourne,\nFlorida, is specifically funding and supporting non-aerospace companies that\nmight benefit from microgravity research.\n\nBiomedicine in particular has yielded perhaps the best results with the\nnearest-term impact, as best represented by LambdaVision, a company\nestablished in 2009 by molecular biologists Nicole Wagner and Robert Birge.\nWhat makes it the most compelling glimpse of LEO\u2019s promise is that\nLambdaVision was not founded as an aerospace company. Rather, Wagner and Birge\nwere building a traditional, Earth-based company atop their research on a\nprotein called bacteriorhodopsin and its potential to restore neural function.\nBR is a \u201cproton pump,\u201d which is just what it sounds like. It pumps a proton\nfrom one side of a cell to the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey focused on the problems of retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration.\nIn a healthy eye, photoreceptor cells\u2014rods and cones\u2014take in light and convert\nit into a signal that goes to bipolar and ganglion cells, and then to the\noptic nerve. In both diseases, the rods and cones start to die, and once they\nare gone, there is nothing to take in light and turn it into a signal that can\nbe sent to the brain. Retinitis pigmentosa, which afflicts 1.5 million people\naround the world, begins by affecting peripheral vision and encroaches inward,\nleading to severe tunnel vision before causing complete blindness. Macular\ndegeneration works the opposite way, first affecting central vision and then\nspreading outward. About 30 million people around the world suffer from it.\nTreatments exist for both diseases, but even the best can only slow their\nprogression. In the end, blindness wins, and once it does, there is no\ntreatment.\n\nWagner, Birge, and their team at LambdaVision had an idea for something that\nmight help: a simple, flexible implant, about as big as the circle stamped out\nby a hole punch and the thickness of a piece of construction paper, that could\nreplace the damaged light-sensing cells and restore full vision. In principle,\nphysicians could install the patch in the back of the eye, the same way they\ntreat detached retinas, so it would not even require specialized training.\n\nThe problem was making this artificial retina. The implant requires using a\nscaffold\u2014essentially a tightly woven porous material similar to gauze\u2014and\nbinding a polymer to it. Atop that, the researchers begin applying alternating\nlayers of BR protein and polymers. With enough layers, the protein can absorb\nenough light and pump protons\u2014hydrogen ions, specifically\u2014toward the bipolar\nand ganglion cells, which take it from there, restoring vision in high\ndefinition.\n\nTo apply multiple layers, scientists float the scaffold on a solution in\nmultiple beakers, moving from one to the next and repeating the process. The\nproblem is that fluid solutions are never perfect\u2014things float, they sink,\nthey settle, they form sediment, they evaporate, there is convection, there\nare surface-tension variations\u2014and every variation and imperfection can lead\nto a flawed layer.\n\nNicole Wagner is cofounder of LambdaVision, a biotech startup that is working\non making artificial retinas in low Earth orbit.\n\nJULIE BIDWELL\n\nIf an implant requires 200 layers, an imperfection at layer 50 compounds\nmassively by the end. The process is simply inefficient, and rife with\nirregular protein deposition. Early trials revealed that this issue negatively\naffected the artificial retina\u2019s performance.\n\nIt was the sort of thing LambdaVision was hoping to work through as part of\nMassChallenge, a business incubation program in Boston. Wagner was working in\nthe business accelerator\u2019s co-working space one day in 2017. It had a\n\u201cGoogle-y\u201d feel, she felt, with an open-concept office and smart people all\naround, and she was at the desk they\u2019d assigned her when somebody dropped by\nto say that the International Space Station National Laboratory was holding a\nlunch presentation down the hall, and there was free pizza.\n\nWhy not, Wagner thought. It would be pretty cool to hear people from NASA talk\nabout the moon and Mars. When she got there, though, it turned out that it\nwasn\u2019t that sort of presentation at all. Instead, representatives from\nCASIS\u2014the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space, a nonprofit that\noperates the ISS National Lab\u2014gave a talk on how they are using microgravity\nto help people on Earth.\n\nThe US segment of the International Space Station, like Los Alamos, Oak Ridge,\nand Brookhaven, is a national laboratory dedicated to scientific and\ntechnological research. The office simply has a better view. About half the\nscience conducted on the US segment is managed by the ISS National Laboratory\nout of Florida, with the remainder overseen by NASA. This division of\nresources allows for a wide range of scientific investigations on the station.\nWhere NASA\u2019s research typically focuses on exploration, space technology, and\nfundamental science to support future deep-space missions, the ISS National\nLaboratory aims to develop a sustainable low-Earth-orbit economy, encompassing\nfields like materials science, biology, pharmaceutical research, and\ntechnology development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n> \u201cI never envisioned doing anything in space\u2014I didn\u2019t know how to get there,\n> or how it worked. Before that moment, it all sounded like science fiction.\u201d\n>\n> Nicole Wagner, cofounder of LambdaVision\n\nResearch being conducted on the station touches on metallurgy and fiber\noptics. Alloys like nitinol (nickel-titanium) can withstand huge temperature\nswings and are superelastic, with extraordinary potential for medical devices,\naerospace, and robotics. Think artificial muscles. The problem is that nitinol\nis extremely hard to make on Earth because materials settle out and heat can\nget distributed unevenly during manufacturing, which yields an unreliable\nproduct. The same liabilities degrade the quality of fiber optics manufactured\non Earth.\n\nThe solution to both is to go to space: in microgravity, heat distributes more\nuniformly and sedimentation does not occur. Crystallization, the process of\nforming and growing crystals, is consistent across long distances with minimal\ndegradation (meaning pristine fiber-optic signals even as you grow across vast\nstretches). More broadly, however, space-based crystallography has\napplications in almost every field of electronics and biomedicine.\n\nAs Wagner learned, researchers have found immediate gains on the space station\ntoday in everything from development of more effective vaccines (gravity on\nEarth harms the interaction of antigens and adjuvants) to higher-grade drug\nformulations and nanoparticle suspensions. One such drug, made by Taiho\nPharmaceutical, is used to treat muscular dystrophy and has reached final-\nstage trials.\n\n\u201cThey were talking at that time about things like bioprinting on orbit, and\nfuture missions they were planning,\u201d Wagner told me. \u201cIt hit me immediately\nthat we could do this\u2014actually leverage microgravity to manufacture an\nartificial retina. I never envisioned doing anything in space\u2014I didn\u2019t know\nhow to get there, or how it worked. Before that moment, it all sounded like\nscience fiction.\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, she immediately called her team. \u201cThere\u2019s a prize that I\nthink we can win,\u201d she said. It was the CASIS-Boeing Technology in Space\nPrize, which funds research that might benefit from space-station access.\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna do it.\u201d\n\nHer team was immediately skeptical. In truth, she had her doubts as well. She\nwas running a small startup. How were they going to build a small, automated\nscience laboratory, put it on the International Space Station, have\ncommunication with it on the ground\u2014how would they afford that? She pulled up\na web browser and typed in \u201craspberry pi communication with space station.\u201d\nShe thought: What am I getting into?\n\nCOURTESY OF LAMBDAVISION\n\nLambdaVision\u2019s artificial retina can be manufactured inside a small box,\nwithout need of astronaut intervention.\n\nCOURTESY OF LAMBDAVISION\n\n\u201cIt was my super-na\u00efve vision of what space was at the time,\u201d she told me. The\nproper term that now described her company, she soon learned, was \u201cspace\nadjacent\u201d: a business that is not specifically in the aerospace industry but\ncould benefit from\u2014even work better by\u2014leaving planet Earth.\n\nShe was relieved when she found out that LambdaVision didn\u2019t have to develop\nits own mission control and space infrastructure. It already existed, and\nthere were partner companies that specialized in space-adjacent businesses.\nHer company linked up with Space Tango, which focuses on building underlying\nhealth and technology products in space, to develop its hardware. They managed\nto condense their open beaker system to an automated experiment the size of a\nshoebox. And she was right about one thing: they did win the prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team flew its first mission at the end of 2018, and it showed promising\nresults. In the years since, the company has secured additional funding and\nflown a total of nine times to the ISS, most recently launching on January 30.\nWith each mission, they have gradually improved their manufacturing hardware,\nsystem automation and imaging, and orbital processes. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing much more\nevenly coated films in microgravity and overcome other challenges we see in a\ngravity environment,\u201d Wagner says. \u201cThere\u2019s much less waste.\u201d\n\n## Related Story\n\nFuture space food could be made from astronaut breath\n\nNASA asked companies to develop the next generation of space food. Here\u2019s what\nthey came up with.\n\nThe system works autonomously, without need of astronaut intervention.\nEssentially, the team assembles it in a small box, astronauts plug it into\npower on the ISS, and when it has manufactured the sheets of artificial\nretinas, an astronaut unplugs it and ships it back to Earth.\n\n\u201cAt first, we just wanted to demonstrate that it\u2019s feasible to do this in\nspace,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cWe don\u2019t worry about that now\u2014we are thinking hard now\nabout scaling the system up. To support our early clinical trials, we don\u2019t\nneed millions of artificial retinas. We need hundreds, maybe thousands, to\nstart. And that gives us time to determine how we are going to scale that up\nas we transition from the ISS\u2014a public space station\u2014to private, commercial\nspace stations in low Earth orbit.\u201d\n\nSo far, LambdaVision has performed small-animal studies in rats and advanced\nto large-animal studies in pigs, successfully installing the implants and\ndemonstrating their tolerability. The company is continuing preclinical\ndevelopment to support clinical trials\u2014doing such things as testing the\nartificial retinas for efficacy and safety\u2014with a goal of beginning human\ntrials as soon as early 2027.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about doing it in space and talking about cost and efficiency, I\ndon\u2019t think about it any differently than if somebody said, \u2018Hey I\u2019m gonna go\ndo this in China\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m gonna go do this in California,\u2019\u201d Wagner says. \u201cA\nspace station is actually closer. It\u2019s only 250 miles in the sky, versus 3,000\nmiles to California.\u201d\n\nIf LambdaVision is successful, that alone would practically justify the vote\ncast by John Lewis 31 years ago. It is hard to think of an achievement more\nprofound than curing blindness for millions. But even more than delivering\nsuch sweeping and life-changing results, one of the most significant\naccomplishments of the ISS might be proving that such results can even be\nachieved in the first place.\n\nSo far, no major medicines born on the space station have been brought to\nmarket. No mass-produced technologies have yet emerged from low Earth orbit.\nResearch has been iterative, and in-space manufacturing remains in the early\nstages. But according to Ariel Ekblaw, CEO of the Aurelia Institute, a\nnonprofit space research center dedicated to working on \u201ccritical path\u201d\ninfrastructure for space architectures, NASA\u2019s groundwork for the ISS has made\na next generation of more product-focused work possible.\n\n\u201cMaybe Dan Goldin was ahead of his time in thinking that such work was going\nto be achieved within the time span of humanity\u2019s first-ever truly large-scale\ninternational space station,\u201d she told me, \u201cand what we see now is not just\nbasic science, but entities like biotech companies actually taking what we\nlearned from NASA and the National Lab over the last 20-plus years, and\nenvision putting mass-produced products or mass-produced infrastructure in\nspace.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA mock-up of NASA\u2019s Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) module, the first\ncomponent of a planned moon-orbiting Gateway station.\n\nJAMES BLAIR/NASA\n\nIf indeed the handoff of low Earth orbit from NASA-led to commercial\noperations succeeds, it would be a promising glimpse of the future of the\nlunar economy. There, as in LEO, NASA is methodically building infrastructure\nand solving fundamental problems of exploration. The moon-orbiting Gateway\nstation\u2014a NASA-led international effort\u2014is deep into development, with the\nHabitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) module set to launch as early as next\nyear. That station will serve as the \u201csecond step\u201d of a sustainable moon\nstrategy that was excised from the Apollo program 60 years ago. From there,\nNASA hopes to cultivate a presence on the lunar surface.\n\nIf the LEO model holds, the agency could one day transfer moon-base operations\nto the private sector and turn to Mars. There might be a lot of money to be\nmade simply in harvesting water on the moon, to say nothing of rare earth\nelements that lend themselves to manufacturing as well.\n\nOne of the harshest restraints on progress in space has been, ironically,\nspace. \u201cRight now, on a good day, only 11 people fit in orbit on ISS and\nTiangong,\u201d says Ekblaw. The age of private space stations is going to be\nfundamentally transformative if only because there will be more room for\ndedicated researchers.\n\nAxiom\u2019s goal is to double its infrastructure in space every five years. This\nmeans doubling the number of people in orbit, the number of hosted payloads,\nand the amount of manufacturing they are capable of doing.\n\n\u201cWithin two to three years, I could send a graduate student to space with\nAxiom,\u201d Ekblaw says. \u201cIt requires a little creative fundraising, but I think\nthat that is opening up a realm of possibility.\u201d In the past, she explains, a\ndoctoral researcher would be unbelievably fortunate to have research fly as\npart of a single flight mission.Today, however, researchers even in a master\u2019s\nprogram can fly experiments repeatedly because of the increased opportunities\nafforded by commercial spaceflight.In the future, rather than relying on\ncareer NASA astronauts\u2014who have myriad responsibilities in orbit and spend a\ngood amount of time as guinea pigs themselves\u2014scientists could go up\npersonally to run their own research projects in greater depth.\n\n\u201cAnd that,\u201d she says, \u201cis a future that is very, very near.\u201d\n\nDavid W.
