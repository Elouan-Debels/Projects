He had a bold idea to share: Humans\u2019 burning of fuel was making the\nplanet warmer.\n\nBy Callendar\u2019s calculations, over the past half century, humanity had added\n150 billion tons of CO_2 to the atmosphere, raising the average global\ntemperature about 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade\u2014a trend, he noted, that\ncould accelerate.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nCallendar, an engineer whose day job was concerned with steam engines and\nturbines, knew he was going up against mainstream scientific wisdom. As he\nwrote at the very beginning of the paper detailing his findings, he was well\naware that few scientists \u201cwould be prepared to admit that the activities of\nman could have any influence upon phenomena of so vast a scale.\u201d^1 But calmly,\nmethodically, he proceeded.\n\nSure enough, Callendar\u2019s presentation immediately met skepticism. Sir George\nSimpson, a prominent scientist soon to head the Royal Meteorological Society,\ndismissed the proposed link between rising CO_2 levels and temperature as\n\u201crather a coincidence.\u201d He also implied that a non-expert could not possibly\nunderstand atmospheric processes well enough to calculate the effects of solar\nradiation which Callendar had asserted was being absorbed in greater\nquantities by increased CO_2 in the atmosphere. Others pointed to alleged\nshortcomings such as the supposed unreliability of Callendar\u2019s data.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\n> Many people thought it impossible that humanity could upset a seemingly\n> stable natural\u2014or divinely ordained\u2014planetary order.\n\nCallendar lucidly answered these criticisms. By prevailing scientific\nstandards, he truly was no expert, though. He was not a Ph.D. scientist but\nheld a certificate from an engineering college; he analyzed climate not within\na large research institution but worked alone, at the home he shared with his\nwife and their two young daughters. But Callendar was not entirely an outsider\nto rigorous scientific research. He was the son of Hugh Callendar, a\ndistinguished British physicist called a \u201cuniversal genius\u201d by Nobel laureate\nErnest Rutherford.\n\nHugh Callendar had studied radiation, meteorology, and many other subjects.\nWith an improved type of thermometer he developed, he also gathered unique,\nwidely used data about steam and steam engines. His son Guy was raised in a\n\u201chousehold filled with books and a vast array of technical gadgets,\u201d according\nto Guy\u2019s biographer James Rodger Fleming. Guy\u2019s scientific education\naccelerated when he apprenticed in his father\u2019s lab at Imperial College London\nin 1922, where Guy learned to perform painstaking research. However, he did\nnot choose academia. After his father died in 1930, he used his knowledge of\nsteam to become a steam engineer.\n\nINCONVENIENT TRUTH-TELLER: Guy Stewart Callendar, a scientifically trained\nsteam engineer, spent years gathering and crunching data by hand to arrive at\na new way of looking at the world\u2014and humans\u2019 power to change it. His\npersistence in arguing for CO_2\u2019s role in raising global temperatures paid off\nonly after his lifetime.

Log in or Join now .\n\nWith this background, the younger Callendar had been excellently, if\nunusually, trained in physics and as a careful researcher. This prepared him\nto deeply explore the possibility that human-produced CO_2 changed global\ntemperatures, an idea hinted at but rejected in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1856, American scientist Eunice Foote had first shown that atmospheric CO_2\nand water vapor strongly absorb heat from sunlight.^2 Later, Irish physicist\nJohn Tyndall proved that the absorption occurs at infrared wavelengths and\nthereby discovered the greenhouse effect. Heat from sunlight radiates from the\nEarth\u2019s surface as infrared light. Before this heat escapes into space, it is\nabsorbed by CO_2 and water vapor, and the accumulated heat warms the Earth.\nWater vapor was thought to be more important than CO_2 in this process. But in\n1896, future Nobel laureate Svante Arrhenius argued that CO_2 could have\noutsized effects. He calculated that the added CO_2 from burning coal could\nchange global temperatures, although based on current industrial production,\nthat would take centuries.\n\nHowever, Arrhenius\u2019 calculation was unpersuasive. The science of the time did\nnot fully understand how CO_2 absorbs infrared light, and many scientists\nthought that added CO_2 could never be a significant factor. Moreover, the\ncalculation was purely theoretical; it was not supported by actual evidence of\nrising CO_2 levels or world temperatures. Also many people, scientist or not,\nthought it impossible that humanity could upset a seemingly stable natural\u2014or\ndivinely ordained\u2014planetary order. For these reasons, Arrhenius\u2019 result was\nlargely ignored.\n\n> Callendar knew he was going up against mainstream scientific wisdom.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nCallendar, however, presented real evidence for a long-term connection between\nanthropogenic (that is, human-produced) atmospheric CO_2_ and a warming trend\noccurring in the present, not the far future; then he explained the trend with\na scientifically sound theory. And despite his initial poor reception, he\npressed on with more research to support his conclusions.\n\nCallendar\u2019s bold persistence in the face of a dubious scientific community was\nsurely bolstered by confidence in his own scientific training and judgment,\nwhich he had received under his father\u2019s tutelage.\n\nOne need was for good data. Callendar found the trends he reported by\ngathering far-flung reports of early measurements of atmospheric CO_2 and by\nporing over decades of data in World Weather Records from the Smithsonian\nInstitution, with its \u201cmass of statistical detail, including many millions of\naccurate and standardized readings of temperature,\u201d as he described in his\n1938 paper. He scrupulously selected the most reliable CO_2 data and chose 147\nsites that gave a balanced picture of global temperatures. He laboriously\nmined and analyzed these datasets by hand, a precursor to what scientists now\ndo routinely\u2014in a digital flash\u2014with massive collections of big data.\n\nThe second need was to explain the observed trends. Callendar used fundamental\nphysics to model how CO_2 in the atmosphere changes the temperature of the\nEarth\u2019s surface. This model, also calculated by hand, was a precursor to\nmodern computer-based (likely eventually AI-based) simulations that are\nessential for climate research and prediction.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

At the time, these were often seen as\nlandmarks of human progress. Not many \u201cwould be prepared to admit that the\nactivities of man could have any influence upon phenomena of so vast a scale,\u201d\nCallendar wrote in his landmark 1938 paper. Image by Everett Collection /\nShutterstock.\n\nThe claims in Callendar\u2019s daring paper have been borne out in the subsequent\neight decades of science. He was the first to find real evidence that the\nhuman burning of fossil fuels had already increased atmospheric CO_2 (by 6\npercent over that past half century)\u2014and to determine the parallel increase in\ntemperature over the same period. His calculations were the first analysis\nthat demonstrated how much the rise in CO_2 had actually changed temperatures.\nCallendar also determined that most of the human-added CO_2 would not be\nremoved by the natural cycle that transports carbon through the Earth\u2019s\nsystems, so he thought anthropogenic atmospheric CO_2 would continue rising.\n\nThere was more. He predicted how far climate zones would shift, calculating a\nretreat of about 22 miles and 79 miles for polar zones in the 20th and 22nd\ncenturies, respectively. He pinpointed a trend in the data for higher-\nelevation sites to warm more quickly than those closer to sea level. He\naccounted for increased \u201cheat-island\u201d effects of urban areas as they grew and\ndeveloped over his study period. (So, he determined that the highest-quality\nreadings came from isolated places like Upernivik, Greenland and Apia, Samoa.)\nAnd to further challenge his own ideas, he looked back in geological time to\ninvestigate the last ice ages and warming periods, to see if similar natural\nforces could be at play in his era\u2014but could not make a plausible case for it.\n\nThus, Callendar concluded, \u201cthe combustion of fossil fuel, whether it be peat\nfrom the surface or oil from 10,000 feet below,\u201d is the cause of the increase\nin global temperatures. Although he had solid arguments to support this, a\nsingle research paper could hardly convince a scientific community that\ndoubted its whole premise. Nevertheless, merely putting forth what came to be\ncalled the Callendar Effect, with the questions and criticisms it evoked,\npropelled research by others, and by Callendar himself. In nearly three dozen\nlater papers, he refined some of the numbers he cited in 1938 but never\nchanged his overall claims.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nBy the time Callendar died in 1964, scientists had not yet widely accepted the\nreality of human-induced warming, although he lived to see the first signs of\na shift. In 1960, Charles Keeling of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography\nbegan publishing data from the pristine air in Antarctica and later at\nHawaii\u2019s Mauna Loa volcano that clearly revealed a growing level of CO_2 (he\nshowed it at 315 parts per million in 1958; today it is 421 ppm; in the pre-\nindustrial 19th century, it had rested around 280 ppm).^3 Other evidence\nmounted, and a tipping point came circa 1990, when the United Nations\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, scientific societies, and\nresearchers began reaching a consensus that human-caused warming is underway\nand would cause dire effects, as is now happening.\n\n> A single research paper could hardly convince a scientific community that\n> doubted its whole premise.\n\nCallendar would have been surprised to learn of these negative outcomes from\nthe warming he had found. He had been quite confident this warming \u201cis likely\nto prove beneficial to mankind.\u201d Europe\u2019s Little Ice Age (circa\n1300-1850)\u2014during which the average temperatures dropped some 2 degrees\nCelsius in the U.K., leading to crop failures, starvation, and mass death\u2014had\nconcluded only during his grandparents\u2019 lifetimes. A little extra warmth,\nCallander posited, would not only expand the range and seasons of crops, but\nalso, he concludes, \u201cthe return of the deadly glaciers should be delayed\nindefinitely.\u201d He estimated that the planet held enough fossil fuels to\nmultiply the amount of CO_2 in the air tenfold. Only later did computer\nclimate modeling begin to foretell the unwelcome effects from global warming.\n\nModern reviews show that Callendar\u2019s work was more accurate and prescient than\nits critics. In 2013, the 75^th anniversary of the 1938 paper, and again in\n2021, the temperatures Callendar cited for 1880 to 1935 were shown to agree\nwell with new, more comprehensive data. Another paper in 2016 examined the\npioneering temperature calculations by Arrhenius and Callendar.^4 Callendar\nwas judged to have used better data and a more realistic atmospheric model,\nbut like Arrhenius, he underestimated the growth rate for atmospheric\ngreenhouse gasses. Correcting for this, the authors found that Callendar\u2019s\napproach, projected 62 years forward to 2000, predicts a global temperature\nrise of 0.52 degrees Celsius, very close to the measured value of 0.6 degrees\nCelsius. These reviews call Callendar\u2019s work \u201cmeticulous\u201d and \u201cremarkable,\u201d\nand note that the physics he used is still the core of modern climate models.\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .\n\nCallendar\u2019s 1938 paper has now been so heavily referenced that it has become a\nclassic, but it was hardly cited at all during Callendar\u2019s lifetime. According\nto Callendar\u2019s biography, he felt some frustration over his lack of\nrecognition. In 1960, listing reasons for the unpopularity of the Callendar\nEffect among leading climate scientists, he put the last reason as, \u201cThey did\nnot think of it themselves!\u201d Such feelings, however, had not kept Callendar\nfrom steadfastly continuing to make his case.\n\nWhen Guy Callendar stood before the Royal Meteorological Society in 1938, he\nbegan a revolution in thinking about humanity\u2019s effects on its own planet\u2014one\nthat is ongoing. Other scientists eventually joined, but it was Callendar who\nkept the revolution alive for decades. Described as a balanced and unassuming\nperson, devoted to work and family, he likely never would have called himself\na rabble rouser. Today, at last, we clearly hear and appreciate that quiet\nvoice.\n\nLead image: Everett Collection / Shutterstock\n\nReferences\n\nNautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.
