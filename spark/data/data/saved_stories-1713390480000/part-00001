In this article\nwe discuss 5 ways to conduct audience research, even when you can\u2019t talk to\npeople.\n\nLet\u2019s start by making it clear. The best design work requires user research,\nwhatever the circumstances.\n\nWithout research, we\u2019re just guessing. Sure, these might be well-educated\nguesses based on our experience... but how can we be certain our solutions are\nthe right ones?\n\nSkipping research can seem like a tempting shortcut to delivering your product\na little sooner. But it\u2019s an incredibly risky move. Not understanding your\naudience from the outset can result in the final product being unusable.\nNeedless to say, it can spell doom for a business.\n\nIn spite of the risks, many organisations are still skeptical about the value\nof user research. To many organisations, research can seem over-expensive and\ntoo time consuming. This is particularly true when research participants are\nelusive, expensive or just generally hard to pin down.\n\nThanks to the changing ways of working brought into effect during the\nCoronavirus pandemic, we\u2019ve all become intimately familiar with tools like\nZoom and Google Hangouts. They\u2019ve allowed us to continue running the more\ntraditional moderated kinds of research (such as user testing & interviews)\nwithout too much issue.\n\nBut what about when contact with our users is totally off the table... Even\nremotely?\n\n## What about when we CAN\u2019T talk to users?\n\nSometimes, for whatever reason, we can\u2019t speak to our audience directly.\n\nIt could be due to extreme time constraints or resistance from our clients, or\nthe very nature of the users themselves. Not being able to speak to users at\nall is an unfortunate reality you\u2019ll sometimes have to face.\n\nThis sounds like a dramatic scenario, but it really does happen. We recently\nworked on an app where the target audience were time-poor investment\nprofessionals. We had limited time & budget for the project, making it very\ndifficult to access these people directly. We did some interviewing when we\ncould, but couldn\u2019t afford the incentives these people needed to take part in\nmoderated user testing sessions.\n\nIn cases like these, what are we to do?\n\nWell, it\u2019s time to get flexible and adapt. We need to seek some alternative,\nad-hoc methods. Here are 5 to get your started. They\u2019re ways to gain some real\nuser insight \u2013 even when you can\u2019t access these people directly.\n\n## 1\\. Trawl the forums\n\nIf you have an existing user base, then they\u2019re probably already talking about\nyou online.\n\nThe internet is a big place. Most industries have a huge choice of online\ncommunities where people can go to rant about products & services. Including\nyours, most likely.\n\nFind out where these conversations are happening. If you\u2019re established\nenough, people will have probably mentioned you for better or worse.\n\nIf not, check out what people are saying about your competitors instead. Find\nout where the opportunities are.\n\n  * Are people crying out for a feature that nobody else is giving them?\n  * Are people using your product in a way that you didn\u2019t expect?\n  * Why aren\u2019t people using your (or a competitor\u2019s) product?\n  * What kinds of lifestyles or attitudes do your users have?\n\nReading through other people\u2019s conversations can be amazingly insightful.\n\nYou\u2019ll build a real picture of your users, and their personalities. It\u2019ll help\nyou understand how they feel about your product and the problem area. You\u2019ll\nlearn the words they use, and the kinds of scenarios they face.\n\nForums are open communities where people discuss what they like (and what they\ndon\u2019t) about products & services... Including yours, most likely.\n\nForums are open communities where people discuss what they like (and what they\ndon\u2019t) about products & services... Including yours, most likely.[/caption]\n\nForum discussions might also help you to understand the language your audience\nuses. Pay attention to the specific words and phrases. If you notice any clear\npatterns, you can adjust the text in your user interface accordingly.\n\nYou\u2019re unlikely to pinpoint specific usability issues with this kind of\nresearch. What it will do is highlight pain points or attitudes you may not\nhave expected.\n\n## 2\\. Read reviews\n\nLike forums, user reviews can be a great source of insight.\n\nThis is especially true if you\u2019re designing an app or digital service. For\nthese types of projects, the reviews section of the App Store should be your\nfirst stop. The people who are willing to write reviews of your work (positive\nor negative) are among your most important users. They\u2019re the most emotionally\ninvested in your product. They\u2019re dedicated enough to commit time writing the\nreview.\n\nPay close attention to how they feel, and any issues they have.\n\nIf you have an app, pay close attention to reviews. They can bring to light\nusability issues, or ideas for new features.\n\nIf you have an app, pay close attention to reviews. They can bring to light\nusability issues, or ideas for new features.[/caption]\n\nThe nature of a review means they\u2019ll be quite specific about what they like,\nand what they don\u2019t. You might identify some granular usability issues or\nbugs.\n\nTry to notice patterns in the feedback and focus only on the recurring\nproblems. Broadly speaking, if 80% of your audience are happy with a certain\nfeature but 20% aren\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s probably ok. You can\u2019t please everyone. If you\nleap on every criticism or suggestion made, you may end up playing \u2018feedback\nwhack-a-mole\u2019.\n\n## 3\\. Speak to those on the front-lines\n\nIn most larger organisations, there will be people whose actual job it is to\nlisten to customer problems and complaints. If you need to understand customer\npain-points, these people will have the insight.\n\nFor example :\n\n  * Ecommerce websites. Shoppers will call customer services if they have a problem.\n  * Internal productivity tools. Workers send complaints and help requests to IT.\n  * Company intranets. Staff who are stuck will email HR asking for help.\n\nThese people can be fairly low down the organisational pecking order, at least\nwhen digital strategy is concerned. Because of this, executives often neglect\nto engage them at all.\n\nThis is a terrible oversight of in-house expertise. The people on the front-\nlines of your business often have the best understanding of the customers.\nAfter all, they deal with them every day. Just talking to these people can\nprovide a whole load of valuable insight and direction.\n\nSpeak to the people on your businesses\u2019 front-lines, like customer support\nstaff. They know your audience best.\n\nSpeak to the people on your businesses\u2019 front-lines, like customer support\nstaff. They know your audience best.\n\nEven if you\u2019re in a position to interview users directly we would still\nrecommend getting close to these customer support teams. They\u2019ll have so much\nknowledge that\u2019ll be helpful to you.\n\nTry asking them :\n\n  * What feedback do you hear most often?\n  * What do you help users with most often?\n  * What do you think the best & worst parts of the existing product are?\n\nDon\u2019t be nervous about approaching these people. After all, your design\nimprovements will make their lives a lot easier, so they should be happy to\nhelp.\n\n## 4\\. Check your analytics data\n\nMost websites should already have something like Google Analytics set up.\n\nBecause analytics tools are often viewed as the marketing team\u2019s remit,\nthey\u2019re often forgotten by designers & developers. This is a massive shame,\nbecause they offer a mind-boggling amount of information about your site\nvisitors.\n\nIf the tool is already set up, then you\u2019ve already got a whole load of insight\nready to be uncovered at the click of a button.\n\nJust one warning. When it comes to analytics data, be cautious of \u2018Analysis\nParalysis\u2019.\n\nTools like Google Analytics have provided us with amazing opportunities to get\nreal user insight quickly and easily... But if it\u2019s not used to drive any\nactions or decisions, then it\u2019s not helpful.\n\nMake sure that you always have a research goal before diving into your\nanalytics.\n\nUse it to answer questions, rather than aimlessly browsing around. Try\nquestions like :\n\n  * Which sections do people visit the most often?\n  * What are people searching for, and do they find what they need?\n  * How do the behaviours of first time visitors differ from returning visitors?\n  * Do people behave differently on mobile to desktop?\n\nSet these questions first, otherwise you\u2019ll end up falling victim to The Cobra\nEffect.\n\nTools like HotJar and FullStory offer user session recordings, and are the\nnext best thing to moderated user testing.\n\nTools like HotJar and FullStory offer user session recordings, and are the\nnext best thing to moderated user testing.\n\n## 5\\. Watch remote session recordings & heat maps\n\nOnline analytics tools have really come a long way in the last few years.\n\nGoogle analytics has always been great for highlighting which parts of the\nsite are underperforming, but it can\u2019t tell you exactly what\u2019s going on there.\n\nA new breed of tools have recently sprung up, dedicated to tracking sessions &\nuser behaviours on the page. There are quite a few to choose from. Industry\nfavourites include HotJar, CrazyEgg, and MouseFlow.\n\nThese tools let you see how far people scroll, what they spend the most time\nlooking at, and where they eventually click.\n\nAt Pixel Fridge we\u2019ve been using HotJar a lot recently. This is because we\nfind the reporting interface quite easy to use and the price is pretty fair.\nYou can actually use it for free up to a certain number of session recordings,\nso there\u2019s value to be had even if you can\u2019t afford the subscription.\n\nHotJar also gives the ability to add little pop-up surveys to your page, which\ncan trigger after the user takes certain actions. It\u2019s a great little bonus,\nand an opportunity to get additional some qualitative data, too.\n\n## All research is good research\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Ideally we\u2019d always be doing our research in-person. We\u2019d\nalways spend time in moderated sessions running interviews and tests, until\nwe\u2019d gotten everything just right.\n\nBut life is rarely that ideal. Sometimes we need to resort to secondary\nmethods like these to get the job done. And that\u2019s OK.\n\nWhatever kind of research you do, primary or secondary, it\u2019s always better\nthan nothing.\n\nThese techniques can also act a \u2018gateway drug\u2019 for more intensive user\nresearch. Seeing results from more ad-hoc methods can whet bosses & clients\nappetites for further learning. It can unlock the gate to doing moderated\nforms of research.\n\nDon\u2019t skip research, even when your users are inaccessible. Make the most of a\nsituation. Do what you can. It always pays off in the long-run.\n\nChris Myhill\n\n\u2014 Director of Experience\n\n## Latest posts\n\nMore blogs\n\n### Our second Impact Report\n\n28th March 2024\n\n### B Corp Month: Our focus on employees at Pixel Fridge\n\n25th March 2024\n\n### International Women\u2019s Day: Spotlight on our Women\n\n8th March 2024\n\n### Celebrating 5 years of Pixel Fridge!\n\n2nd February 2024\n\n0.41g of CO_2/viewWebsite Carbon\n\nCleaner than 57% of pages tested\n\n#### Let's make something brilliant\n\nHave a project you\u2019d like to discuss?
