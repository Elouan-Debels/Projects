I\u2019m happy to say that applying to YC was not one of them, as YC\nhas given us 3 competitive edges we didn\u2019t expect when we first got in. Want\nto know what they are? Scroll to the bottom to find out \ud83d\ude42\n\n# So.. why did we even apply to YC in the first place?\n\nApplying to YC was the easiest choice we ever made. We knew the odds of us\ngetting in were slim, but it was a low-risk option to try and apply.\n\nOur first startup idea, Ikonomos, was a product that helped software engineers\nonboard into companies. While we were building Ikonomos, we made all of the\nmistakes you could imagine\n\n  1. We built a product without talking to any users (\u201dI know what users want!\u201d)\n  2. Squabbled about tons of unnecessary features (\u201dWe need this to be ready for thousands of users\u201d)\n  3. Built a tarpit idea that definitely no one had ever thought of before\n\nWe didn\u2019t realize we were approaching startups incorrectly until we started\nwatching YC\u2019s startup school videos, and YC\u2019s how to start a startup stanford\nlecture series. We realized that startups could be approached with a pretty\nreasonable framework:\n\n  1. Talk to users (and sell the product)\n  2. Build the product that would achieve the sale\n  3. Repeat (but don\u2019t forget about the million nuances in between)\n\nWe also came across several blog posts Paul Graham wrote about starting a\nstartup, which all help shine a light onto something we knew very little\nabout: the mechanics of actually starting a company from nothing.\n\n# Amazing.. so you applied and got in right?\n\nWrong. We were actually rejected on our first try. We were fortunate enough to\nbe invited for an interview, only to blunder every question that probed into\nany business-facing decision we had made about our startup.\n\nWe knew that we could build product and ship code, but we hadn\u2019t been able to\nanswer one fundamental question: \u201cWhy would someone want to use your product\u201d.\nIt was clear that we were approaching building a startup wrong, and it was\ntime to recalibrate.\n\n# So what happened after that??\n\nWe spent a few months trying to sell Ikonomos to no avail \u2014 it turns out no\none wanted to buy what we had built. After talking to over 100 engineering\nleaders, we realized something that we should have realized earlier: the\nbiggest problem companies had with onboarding wasn\u2019t their internal tooling\n(Notion is pretty good at this), but instead was an organizational problem.\n\nWe knew we had to pivot.\n\n# YC\u2019s advice \u2014 founder market fit\n\nWe decided to back to the drawing board and started coming up with tons of new\nstartup ideas. I spent a lot of time interviewing my friends, my neighbours,\nanyone I could talk to to understand what problems they were having.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until we watched Dalton\u2019s video about pivoting where something\nclicked \u2014 perhaps we should build a framework for evaluating startup ideas and\nfocus on problems we\u2019ve had in the past!\n\nThis is how we landed on the idea we got into YC with: Wyvern \u2014 a machine\nlearning platform to help marketplace optimize revenue through better product\nranking.\n\n# Applying the second time\n\nBy this point, we were seasoned startup scrubs. We were talking to lots of\npeople working in marketplaces to see if they would benefit from a specialized\nplatform for ML, and we even managed to find our first customer! The only\nproblem was.. we didn\u2019t even have a product yet. All we had were a series of\ndocuments describing how the product would work if the company purchases it\nfrom us.\n\nWe were rapidly approaching the YC Application deadline, which required\nsubmitting a demo so we did the unthinkable \u2014 we wrote the application on the\nlast day, recorded a demo video showing how our product would work if it\nexisted, and submitted it\n\n# Getting the interview\n\nIn the month following our YC application, we were working around the clock to\nsatisfy this customer and bring our product to life. We even managed to show\nenough progress to get this customer to sign a contract saying they are ready\nto pay for and use our product and will help us build it! A few days after\nthis happened, we were invited for an interview.\n\nFor anyone that doesn\u2019t know, YC\u2019s interview process is pretty intense: It\u2019s a\n10 minute interview that decides your fate. YC gives you ~2-3 days notice\nbefore the actual interview.\n\nShortly after we got our invitation, I messaged every naturally skeptical\nperson I know to set up mock interviewing sessions. I wanted to make sure I\u2019ve\nthought though every flaw in our startup plan. Two gruelling days of practice\nlater, I was convinced that our startup idea sucked, since there were a\nmillion things that could go wrong with it.\n\n# Second time\u2019s the charm??\n\nOne of two things can happen after every YC interview:\n\n  1. If you were rejected, they will notify you with an email which includes some feedback about what they were unsure about\n  2. If you are accepted, they call you on the phone to invite you to join them\n\nSo.. after our interview, we were awaiting our fate. I remember the hours\nrolled by with no answer.. until suddenly we got an email: \u201cAre you free for a\nfollow-up call tomorrow\u201d?\n\nWHAT? This wasn\u2019t one of the two scenarios they\u2019ve outlined. What does this\nmean?? Is it going to be a second interview? Some live feedback? It turns out\nthey wanted to ask us a few more follow-up questions, and invited us to join\nYC!!! YAY!!!\n\n# Didn\u2019t you say there were surprising benefits or something?\n\nAlright alright, I\u2019ll get right to the point. One of the most common questions\nI get is \u201cwhat are the benefits of applying to YC\u201d?\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that 90% of this post talked about life before YC, and how the\npublic YC content helped us make a tremendous amount of progress. I just want\nto re-iterate that point: most of YC\u2019s wisdom is actually open-source. All of\nthe information you need to get started with a startup can be found in the\nlinks above (and in YC\u2019s knowledge base). That being said...\n\nThere are 3 surprising benefits to YC:\n\n  1. YC helps you create a peer-group of founders in the same position as you, which can be an incredibly motivating force\n  2. Bookface, YC\u2019s internal social forum, is a trove of high quality discourse, and acts as an implicit source of warm intros to other YC founders\n  3. YC\u2019s Launch pad is great for getting your product in front of lots of startup-minded people\n\nAnd there are 2 things that ended up mattering less than I thought:\n\n  1. Fundraising \u2014 it turns out that building a great product and generating revenue far outweigh YC\u2019s brand when raising money\n  2. YC\u2019s Brand \u2014 while useful as social proof, it doesn\u2019t replace the need to have a great product / solve a real problem\n\n## Sign up for more like this.\n\nEnter your email\n\nSubscribe\n\n## We open-sourced and ended up #1 on Hackernews\n\nSkyvern?
