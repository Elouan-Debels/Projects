floods\n\nPublished Wed, Apr 17 20245:26 AM EDTUpdated 4 Hours Ago\n\nJoan Muwahed@joanmuwahed\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nKey Points\n\n  * The NCM said it had tracked the incoming heavy rainfall but did not target any clouds during that period, attributing the storm to natural rainfall.\n  * The Gulf state has experienced a rise in rainfall in the last few years and precipitation is expected to increase by 30% in the coming years, according to a report from the science journal Nature.\n\nA view of the street after heavy rainfall as adverse weather conditions affect\ndaily life in Dubai.\n\nAnadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 The National Center of Meteorology, a government\ntaskforce responsible for cloud seeding missions in the United Arab Emirates,\ndenied reports that it carried out the weather modification technique in the\nrun-up to heavy storms across the country, therefore exacerbating flooding in\nplaces like Dubai.\n\nThe organization told CNBC that it did not dispatch pilots for seeding\noperations before or during the storm that struck the UAE on Tuesday.\n\nOmar AlYazeedi, deputy director general of the NCM, said the agency \u201cdid not\nconduct any seeding operations during this event.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOne of the basic principles of cloud seeding is that you have to\ntarget clouds in its early stage before it rains, if you have a severe\nthunderstorm situation then it is too late to conduct any seeding operation.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the country experienced its heaviest downpour to date, with more\nthan 250 millimeters (10 inches) of rainfall in the Emirate of Al Ain,\naccording to NCM figures, and recording more than 100 mm in places like Dubai.\nThe annual rainfall in the UAE averages between 140 to 200 mm.\n\nThe NCM denial follows an earlier Bloomberg report, in which Ahmed Habib, a\nspecialist meteorologist, had said that the Tuesday rains had stemmed partly\nfrom cloud seeding. Habib later told CNBC that six pilots had flown missions\nas part of regular protocol, but had not seeded any clouds. CNBC was not able\nto independently verify the reports.\n\nwatch now\n\nVIDEO9:2309:23\n\nHow does a desert turn green?\n\nInternational Digital Originals\n\nCloud seeding, a process used to enhance rainfall, has been an integral part\nof the UAE\u2019s mission to solve water shortages. Seeding missions were\nintroduced in the 1990s, and more than 1,000 hours of cloud seeding are now\nperformed annually.\n\nThe NCM said it had tracked the incoming heavy rainfall but did not target any\nclouds during that period, attributing the storm to natural rainfall.\n\nThe deputy director general added: \u201cWe take the safety of our people, pilots,\nand aircrafts very seriously. The NCM does not conduct cloud seeding\noperations during extreme weather events.\u201d\n\nThe Gulf state has experienced a rise in rainfall in the last few years, and\nprecipitation is expected to increase by 15%-30% in the coming years,\naccording to a report from the science journal Nature.\n\nTraditionally characterized by its desert climate and scarce rainfall, the UAE\nhas experienced shifts in weather patterns over time as a consequence of\nclimate change.\n\nThe UAE government\u2019s National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management\nAuthority issued warnings on social media platform X ahead of the unstable\nweather conditions and urged residents to stay home and adhere to safety\nguidelines.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s infrastructure and buildings are designed to endure weather patterns\ntypical to the region, such as minimal rainfall. The Emirates\u2019 drainage\nsystems struggled to cope during the unprecedented downpours, resulting in\nflooded roads and airports and halting the country\u2019s main operations.\n\nVehicles are stranded on a flooded street following heavy rains in Dubai early\non April 17, 2024. Dubai, the Middle East\u2019s financial center, has been\nparalyzed by the torrential rain that caused floods across the UAE and Bahrain\nand left 18 dead in Oman on April 14 and 15.\n\nGiuseppe Cacace | Afp | Getty Images\n\nTV\n\nWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
