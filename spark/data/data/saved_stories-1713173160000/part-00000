For starters, the annual cost of a full-time senior-level iOS\nEngineer in the US now exceeds $150,000, plus benefits (and good luck finding\none available). Aside from that, you may not always have enough work to keep\nthem busy at all times, so you're stuck paying for time you aren't able to\nutilize. With the monthly plan, you can pause and resume your subscription as\noften as you need to ensure you're only paying your iOS Engineer when you have\nwork available for them.\n\nIs there a limit to how many requests I can have?\n\nOnce subscribed, you're able to add as many development requests to your queue\nas you'd like, and they will be delivered one by one.\n\nHow fast will tasks be completed?\n\nOn average, most requests are completed in just two days or less. However,\nmore complex requests can take longer.\n\nWho are the iOS engineers?\n\nOur iOS engineering team consists of two highly skilled professionals: the co-\nfounders of SwiftAppLab. With our combined expertise, we bring years of\nexperience in iOS development to the table. As the founders, we are deeply\ncommitted to delivering top-notch solutions and ensuring your projects receive\nthe attention and expertise they deserve. When you work with us, you'll have\ndirect access to both of us, allowing for seamless communication and\ncollaboration throughout the development process.\n\nHow does the pause feature work?\n\nWe understand you may not have enough development work to fill up entire\nmonth. Perhaps you only have one or two development requests at the moment.\nThat's where pausing your subscription comes in handy. Billing cycles are\nbased on 31 day period. Let's say you sign up and use the service for 21 days,\nand then decide to pause your subscription. This means that the billing cycle\nwill be paused and you'll have 10 days of service remaining to be used anytime\nin the future.\n\nAre there any refunds if I don't like the service?\n\nDue to the high quality nature of the work, there will be no refunds issued.\n\n### Still have questions?\n\nLet's chat\n\nBased in Dallas, Texas \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf1\n\nThank you!
