They reportedly face charges ranging from\nviolating banking law, bribery and abuse of power. According to Thanh Nien, 84\nhave received sentences, which range from 3 years suspended prison to life\nimprisonment.\n\n## Crucial Quote\n\nIn her final remarks to the court last week, Lan appeared to indicate she had\nexperienced thoughts of suicide, according to AFP and state media. \u201cIn my\ndesperation, I thought of death,\u201d she said. \u201cI am so angry that I was stupid\nenough to get involved in this very fierce business environment \u2013 the banking\nsector \u2013 which I have little knowledge of.\u201d\n\n## Key Background\n\nLan\u2019s trial comes as part of a broader crackdown on corruption by Vietnam\u2019s\ncommunist government. The project, which Vietnam\u2019s general secretary and\nleader Nguyen Phu Trong dubbed \u201cblazing furnace,\u201d has claimed the careers of\ntwo presidents in as many years, as well as thousands of other officials and\nbureaucrats. Lan was arrested under the corruption drive in 2022. According to\nthe BBC, Lan comes from a Sino-Vietnamese family in Ho Chi Minh City, which\nwas formerly known as Saigon, and began as a market stall vendor, later\nfounding her real estate company VTP and buying land and property amid\neconomic reforms in the 1980s.\n\n## Big Number\n\n6 tonnes. That\u2019s how much the 104 boxes of evidence used in the trial weighed,\naccording to the BBC.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nBBC NewsTruong My Lan: Vietnamese billionaire accused in multi-billion dollar\nbank fraud\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
