In trials, this process has been shown to reduce the\naverage length of a VAR decision by 31 seconds.\n\nSheffield United deducted two points by EFL for defaulting on payments\n\nRead more\n\nClubs voted unanimously to introduce the technology at a Premier League\nshareholders\u2019 meeting on Thursday, with its first use expected in the autumn\nbut not at the season\u2019s start. The league had previously expressed\nreservations over adopting the technology but it has received the full backing\nof the referees\u2019 chief Howard Webb, who said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the news.\n\nSemi-automated offside technology was used successfully during the 2022 World\nCup in Qatar. It eliminates the need for VARs to manually add lines to camera\nimages and will produce graphics that can be shown to fans in stadiums. VARs\nmay still be required to assess offside decisions in the event of a goal being\nscored, depending on the complexity of the assessment.\n\nWebb and the referees\u2019 body PGMOL are in discussions over allowing fans to see\nthe footage examined by referees at VAR monitors at the same time as\nofficials. There is the expectation that short messages on the outcome of VAR\ndecisions will be announced by referees in stadiums next season.\n\nIn a statement the league said: \u201cThe technology will provide quicker and\nconsistent placement of the virtual offside line, based on optical player\ntracking, and will produce high-quality broadcast graphics to ensure an\nenhanced in-stadium and broadcast experience for supporters.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Football\n  * Video assistant referees (VARs)\n  * Laws of football\n  * Referees\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Football\n  * Live scores\n  * Tables\n  * Fixtures\n  * Results\n  * Competitions\n  * Clubs\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
