Wholf\n\nUpdated on: April 10, 2024 / 10:38 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nFirst national standard for drinking water\n\nBiden administration announces national standard for drinking water 01:33\n\nFor the first time ever, the Environmental Protection Agency announced\nWednesday it is issuing a national regulation limiting the amount of certain\nper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, found in drinking water.\n\nCommonly called \"forever chemicals,\" PFAS are synthetic chemicals found nearly\neverywhere \u2013 in air, water, and soil \u2013 and can take thousands of years to\nbreak down in the environment.\n\nThe EPA has stated there is no safe level of exposure to PFAS without risk of\nhealth impacts, but now it will require that public water utilities test for\nsix different types of PFAS chemicals to reduce exposure in drinking water.\nThe new standards will reduce PFAS exposure for 100 million people, according\nto the EPA, and prevent thousands of deaths and illnesses.\n\n\"Drinking water contaminated with PFAS has plagued communities across this\ncountry for too long,\" EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan said in a statement\nWednesday.\n\nFor public water utility companies to comply with the new drinking water\nstandards, the EPA is making $1 billion available to states and territories to\nimplement PFAS testing and treatment at public water systems. That money is\npart of a $9 billion investment made possible by the 2021 Bipartisan\nInfrastructure Law to assist communities impacted by PFAS contamination.\n\n\"President Biden believes that everyone deserves access to clean, safe\ndrinking water, and he is delivering on that promise,\" said Brenda Mallory,\nChair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, in a statement.\n\nPFAS have been in use since the 1940s, often to repel oil and water, and are\nheat resistant, which makes them popular for a variety of products. But\naccording to industry documentation, manufacturers have known for decades that\nPFAS are toxic.\n\n\"They can be found in everything from nonstick cookware to cleaning and\npersonal care products,\" said Regan during a press briefing. \"But there's no\ndoubt that many of these chemicals can be harmful to our health and our\nenvironment.\"\n\nResearch confirms that exposure to certain levels of PFAS in the environment\ncan cause a range of health issues, from reproductive problems, including\ndecreased fertility, to developmental delays in children and low birth weight,\nas well as a suppressed immune system, increased cholesterol levels, impacts\nto the cardiovascular system, and certain types of cancer.\n\n\"I think the strongest data is for kidney cancer and then testicular cancer,\"\nDr. Linda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute of Environmental\nSciences, told CBS News. \"But evidence is growing for several other forms of\ncancer.\"\n\nCritics argue the EPA didn't go far enough because there are more than 15,000\nPFAS chemicals, and this standard only regulates six.\n\n\"I think that we need to begin addressing PFAS as a whole class of chemicals,\"\nBirnbaum said. \"And we need to ask the question, do we really need them?\"\n\nThe EPA estimates that of the 66,000 public water utility systems impacted by\nthe standard, 6% to 10% may need to act to comply with the regulations.\nOperators will have three years to test for PFAS pollution, then an additional\ntwo years to identify, purchase and install necessary technology to treat\ncontaminated water.\n\nErik D. Olson, senior strategic director of health at the Natural Resources\nDefense Council, tells CBS News that the EPA estimates it will cost about $1.5\nbillion \"to treat all this water and to protect people's health. The benefits,\nin our view, far outweigh those costs.\"\n\nDespite knowing the risks for several years, it's taken a significant amount\nof time to regulate PFAS on the federal level.\n\n\"There's just a huge amount of political opposition from the chemical industry\nand, frankly, from some of the water utilities, that don't want EPA to\nregulate these chemicals, because they know that once EPA cracks down on them,\nit's going to cost them a lot of money, and they don't want to spend that\nmoney,\" Olson said.\n\nWhile the onus on clean up will come at the cost of the water utility\ncompanies, the new regulations do little to hold polluters accountable for the\ndamage PFAS have done to the environment and human health. There have been\nseveral major settlements in recent years by chemical companies over PFAS\ncontamination, a notable one being a $10.3 billion settlement reached by 3M in\nJune 2023.\n\nIf you want to limit your exposure to PFAS in drinking water, you can ask your\nwater utility how it is testing for the chemicals, or have your water tested\nby a state-certified laboratory using EPA-testing standards. There are several\ntechnologies available to purchase to filter PFAS from your home water source.\nAs for PFAS found in other common goods, there are several running lists to\nhelp track which companies have banned PFAS from their products.\n\n### More from CBS News\n\nDude Perfect's latest trick \u2014 sinking up to $300 million in private funding\n\nAre no-penalty CDs a smart choice this spring?
