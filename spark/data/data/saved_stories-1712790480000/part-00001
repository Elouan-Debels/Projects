So if he wants to introduce you to the biological complexity\nthat makes them worthy of study, be prepared to follow a deliberately cautious\nroute climbing over boulders and stepping over logs.\n\nTake San Timoteo Canyon, a river valley near the San Bernardino County city of\nRedlands offering all the creature comforts rattlesnakes need to multiply and\nprosper: rock outcrops on which to bask in the sun, thickets of vegetation for\ncamouflage, and loads of ground squirrels to feed on.\n\nOn a recent sunny morning, it didn\u2019t take Hayes long to find what he was\nlooking for: a red diamond rattlesnake buzzing a fearsome drum roll as it\nslithered through tall, lush grass and, just a few feet away, a Pacific\nrattlesnake, its forked-tongue flicking as it peered at him from the shade of\na bush.\n\n\u201cRattlesnakes are among the most feared, misunderstood and abused animals of\nall,\u201d the 62-year-old said as he nodded toward the venomous serpents. \u201cYet,\nthey are not all that different from us. They, too, have fears, emotions and\nfind comfort in companionship.\u201d\n\nWilliam Hayes, a research biologist at Loma Linda University and expert on\nSouthern California rattlesnakes, searches for rattlers recently.\n\nRecent studies have led Hayes and a team of mostly Loma Linda University\nresearchers to the provocative conclusion that rattlesnakes are anything but\njust instinctive people killers. They are individuals in complex communities\nthat show a spectrum of temperament and emotions that can persist over time in\ndifferent situations.\n\nA year ago, the team discovered the first evidence that a stressed rattlesnake\ncan find solace in the presence of a nearby companion, or \u201cfriend,\u201d leading to\na healthy, stable heart rate, similar to the way humans calm each other down.\n\nAggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health\nand science.\n\nExplore our new section\n\nNow, they have seized on a new explanation for the unusually heightened levels\nof defensive behavior of rattlesnakes on Santa Catalina Island: It pays to\nrattle more, bite more often and inject more toxin on an island where they\ncould be trampled or stomped to death by imported goats, pigs, bison and deer,\naccording to a study published recently in the scientific journal Toxins.\n\n\u201cThe results of this study unambiguously revealed substantially greater\ndefensiveness in Catalina rattlesnakes compared to mainland rattlesnakes,\u201d the\nstudy says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe finding is particularly significant because it suggests a paradoxical\nexception to \u201cisland tameness,\u201d the phenomenon noted by Charles Darwin 180\nyears ago: Finches, fur seals and marine iguanas on the Galapagos Islands were\nmore docile than mainland birds, seals and reptiles. Darwin attributed their\ntameness to a lack of predators and large nonnative ungulates in their native\nhaunts.\n\nAn adult male red diamond rattlesnake.\n\nNot so on Catalina, about 22 miles off the coast of Los Angeles.\n\nHumans are believed to have populated Catalina about 8,000 years ago, bringing\nwith them the large nonnative mammals whose density \u201chas likely exceeded that\non the mainland in recent centuries and up to the present,\u201d the study says.\n\nOver the last three decades, the conservancy that owns nine-tenths of the\nisland has shot, trapped, and shipped out all the invasive goats and pigs, and\nnearly all the bison that were literally eating away the island\u2019s native\nvegetation.\n\nNow, a plan to use helicopter-mounted sharpshooters to kill a remnant mule\ndeer population that varies from about 1,500 to 2,000 roaming the mountains of\nCatalina has ignited a storm of protest among residents of the popular resort\ndestination and prompted calls to state wildlife authorities to block the\nhunt.\n\nIn the meantime, Catalina\u2019s rattlesnakes are biting back at deer herds with\nall the rattling and venom they can muster, the study says.\n\n\u201cBy introducing mammalian predators and antagonists to Catalina, humans have\nmade encounters with rattlesnakes more dangerous,\u201d the study suggests, \u201ca fact\nthat should be appreciated by those who currently oppose the removal of deer\nfrom Catalina.\u201d\n\nA mule deer doe walks through a hillside on Catalina Island.\n\n(Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)\n\nJulie King, a co-author of the study and expert on Santa Catalina Island\necology, said, \u201cThe rattlesnakes see deer as a threat that could squash them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they have developed a social language and behavior,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\nwarns, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m down here, don\u2019t step on me or you\u2019ll be sorry.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe study suggests that an additional potential cause for the unusual\naggressiveness of the Catalina rattlesnakes is that they are smaller \u2014 on\naverage \u2014 than those on the mainland. Even though they are smaller, they prey\nupon native ground squirrels and deer mice with formidable teeth and claws\nthat are larger than those on the mainland.\n\n\u201cTo minimize the risks of retaliatory injury,\u201d the study suggests,\n\u201crattlesnakes and other vipers have evolved unique strategies to acquire\ndangerous prey, including the release of prey immediately after the\nenvenomating bite, followed by chemosensory searching to relocate their meal,\nwhich often travels meters or before succumbing to the venom.\u201d\n\nThe study points out that these behavioral changes can increase \u201crisks\nassociated with humans interacting with snakes from this population, and\npotentially suffering severe or even fatal envenomation.\u201d\n\nGerad Fox, 42, a co-author of the study, said, \u201cOur findings, and the recent\ndiscoveries of others, have only scratched the surface of rattlesnake\npersonality.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is so much more to learn,\u201d Fox added. \u201cBit by bit, we\u2019re building a\nbetter understanding of an important part of our natural world, one that\ndeserves our respect and protection.\u201d\n\n### More to Read\n\n  * ### Letters to the Editor: Burrowing owls deserve better from California\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\n  * ### Editorial: California\u2019s rat poison bans aren\u2019t working.
