I want to talk about\nsomething else: the remarkable clarity of the writing done by Ritchie and the\nother early Unix developers at Bell Labs.\n\nThe early Unix user\u2019s manuals, both the man pages and the longer pieces, were\nwritten by the programmers themselves. You might think this a recipe for\ndisaster; as a class, programmers aren\u2019t known for their facility with\nEnglish. But the early Unix developers weren\u2019t ordinary programmers. They were\nresearchers who thought deeply about how programs, languages, and operating\nsystems ought to be organized, and they expected to write technical papers\nabout their work.\n\nScholarly papers have a reputation for dullness, but good ones aren\u2019t dull to\npeople who know, or want to learn, the topic. If you have any interest in\nUnix, you should take a look at Dennis Ritchie\u2019s old home page. Not only will\nyou find links to wonderful old papers about C and Unix, you\u2019ll get an\nimmediate sense of the man behind them. Here\u2019s the section he labels History:\n\n> For many years, I worked in the Computing Sciences Research Center of Bell\n> Labs. On October 2005, a reorganization redistributed this group, and I\u2019m\n> now with the center called by the slightly ungainly name of Convergence,\n> Software and Computer Science Laboratory (but still in the same office).\n> This experience has been more varied than it might seem; here\u2019s some of the\n> history:\n>\n> When I joined in 1967, Bell Labs was a corporation jointly owned by American\n> Telephone and Telegraph Company and its subsidiary Western Electric. Its\n> official name was Bell Telephone Laboratories, Incorporated.  \n> ---  \n> Soon after, Ken Thompson, together with me and others, first started work on\n> Unix. Also soon after, AT&T, which still owned most of the Bell System,\n> updated its logo (I doubt the events were related). The new logo just\n> updated the image; corporate structure remained the same. The material\n> published by us during the period up to 1984 used this Bell logo and the\n> name \u201cBell Laboratories.\u201d  \n> In 1984, AT&T, under a negotiated consent decree, divested the local\n> telephone companies it had owned and in the process gave up the Bell logo\n> and the Bell name except in connection with Bell Laboratories. Bell\n> Telephone Laboratories Inc. was dissolved as a corporation and became an\n> integrated unit of AT&T. We lost the Wehrmacht helmet and gained the\n> Deathstar, and now identified ourselves as working at \u201cAT&T Bell\n> Laboratories.\u201d  \n> In 1996, AT&T (this time voluntarily) spun off its systems and technology\n> organizations into Lucent Technologies, while AT&T kept the services\n> business. Bell Labs stayed mostly with Lucent, though some of our colleagues\n> helped form a new AT&T labs, much as some of us went to Bellcore in 1984.\n> The new corporate logo usually includes the line \u201cBell Labs Innovations.\u201d  \n> Lucent and Alcatel merged as of Dec 1, 2006. Another new name and logo! and\n> still the same office.  \n>  \n> Bell Labs has remained a remarkably good place to do work that has enduring\n> impact over the long run, no matter what the company, the courts, the PR\n> types or upper management decide should be our name and logo on a given day\n> or year.\n\nConcise, factual, gently humorous. The same style you see in most of the old\nUnix stuff.\n\nRitchie\u2019s most famous piece of writing is, of course, The C Programming\nLanguage, which he wrote with Brian Kernighan. K&R is basically a rewrite of\nKernighan\u2019s C tutorial, Ritchie\u2019s C reference manual, and a paper with the\nsame title written by Ritchie, Kernighan, Steve Johnson, and Mike Lesk for a\n1978 issue of the Bell System Technical Journal that was all about Unix. Most\nC programming books could substitute as boat anchors; K&R is only half an inch\nthick but always seems to have the answer you\u2019re looking for.\n\n(These are my copies of the 1978 and 1984 special Unix issues of the Bell\nSystem Technical Journal. Why do I have them? I found them on the giveaway\nshelves at my local library. This isn\u2019t as weird as it sounds. I live in\nNaperville, Illinois, home to one of the Bell Labs facilities. People often\ndonate their old books to the library, and the library gives away those it\ncan\u2019t make use of. Someone from the Labs must have dropped these off when\nclearing out their own library shelves. I\u2019ve scored a handful of Unix books\nthis way.)\n\nKernighan (the K in AWK) was probably the best writer of the group. I am\ncontinually amazed at how he manages to get across complex ideas in so few\nwords. My favorite passage in any piece of technical writing is in the user\nmanual for eqn\n\n^1 he wrote with Lorinda Cherry:\n\n> A word of warning about matrices\u2014each column must have the same number of\n> elements in it. The world will end if you get this wrong.\n\nAlfred Aho (the A in AWK) cowrote the Dragon books on compiler design. Ken\nThompson wrote \u201cReflections on Trusting Trust\u201d, which says, in a very simple\nand understandable way, things about compilers that Aho would probably prefer\nto sweep under a rug.\n\nThe clarity of these guys\u2019 writing is undoubtedly a reflection of the clarity\nof their thoughts\u2014the same clarity that makes Unix such a pleasure to use. We\nMac and Linux users are lucky to have had such brilliant forebears.\n\nOne more thing. If you\u2019re a proponent of plain text files, you have another\nreason to appreciate Dennis Ritchie and the old Unix developers: they wrote a\nton of tools for manipulating text. Both the tools they wrote directly\u2014like\ntroff, grep, awk, sed, sort, wc, tr, and so on\u2014and the later tools they\ninspired\u2014like Perl, Python, and Ruby\u2014are the basis for all the\nMarkdown/HTML/PDF transformations that are part of your daily workflow.\n\nUpdate 10/18/11 The Ritchie family recently updated the DMR page at Bell Labs.\nThe old content is still there, but they\u2019ve added this:\n\n> Dennis died in early October, 2011. This is a note from his sister and\n> brothers: As Dennis\u2019s siblings, Lynn, John, and Bill Ritchie\u2014on behalf of\n> the entire Ritchie family\u2014we wanted to convey to all of you how deeply\n> moved, astonished, and appreciative we are of the loving tributes to Dennis\n> that we have been reading. We can confirm what we keep hearing again and\n> again:\n>\n> Dennis was an unfailingly kind, sweet, unassuming, and generous brother\u2014and\n> of course a complete geek. He had a hilariously dry sense of humor, and a\n> keen appreciation for life\u2019s absurdities\u2014though his world view was entirely\n> devoid of cynicism or mean-spiritedness.\n>\n> We are terribly sad to have lost him, but touched beyond words to realize\n> what a mark he made on the world, and how well his gentle personality\u2014beyond\n> his accomplishments\u2014seems to be understood.\n>\n> Lynn, John, and Bill Ritchie\n\n  1.
