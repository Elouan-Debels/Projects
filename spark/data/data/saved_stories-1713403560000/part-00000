Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation\nCommission\n\nSomething strange is happening to fish off the coast of Florida.\n\nAt least 40 different species have been spotted \u201cspinning and whirling\u201d in the\nwater near the Lower Florida Keys, and some of the fish have died, according\nto a statement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n(NOAA). So far, scientists can\u2019t explain what\u2019s causing this abnormal trend.\n\nThe affected creatures range \u201call the way from the very small bait-type fish,\nlike pinfish, all the way up to things like groupers and even some stingrays,\u201d\nsays Dean Grubbs, a marine biologist at Florida State University, to NBC News\u2019\nMarissa Parra, Maria Pi\u00f1ero and Lora Kolodny.\n\nThough the bizarre behavior is concerning across the board, wildlife\nbiologists are particularly worried about how it has impacted the smalltooth\nsawfish (Pristis pectinata), an endangered species with a long, flat nose and\nsharp, chainsaw-like teeth.\n\nMore than 28 dead smalltooth sawfish had been recorded as of March 24, per\nNOAA. But the true death toll is likely even higher, because the bodies of\nthese fish, which can grow up to 16 feet long, typically sink.\n\nA total of 109 smalltooth sawfish have been observed spinning, including the\n28 that ultimately died.\n\nCraig Schertzer spotted a sawfish that had washed up in the tide between Big\nPine Key and Marathon in early March. It was still alive, but it appeared to\nbe struggling to get back to open water, according to videos Schertzer posted\non social media.\n\n\u201cIt was in such distress and there was nothing anybody could do,\u201d Schertzer\ntells FOX 13 News\u2019 Kimberly Kuizon.\n\nWhy are fish spinning to death in Florida?\n\nWatch on\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many smalltooth sawfish still exist in the wild in the\nUnited States, but \u201cit is believed that the population is currently only a\nsmall fraction of its historic size,\u201d according to a NOAA fact sheet. The\ncreatures used to live in coastal waters between Texas and North Carolina but\nare now primarily found near Florida.\n\n\u201cGiven the limited population size of smalltooth sawfish, the mortality of at\nleast two dozen sawfish could have an impact on the recovery of this species,\u201d\nsays Adam Brame, the sawfish recovery coordinator for NOAA Fisheries, in the\nstatement.\n\nNOAA, in partnership with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation\nCommission and local aquariums, now plans to launch its first-ever emergency\nresponse effort to try to save Florida\u2019s smalltooth sawfish.\n\nRipley\u2019s Aquariums, the Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium and Dynasty Marine\nAssociates Inc. have offered to temporarily house wild sawfish in quarantine\nfacilities until the cause of the mysterious behavior can be identified.\n\nThe logistics of the emergency response will be complex, because biologists\nhave never attempted to rescue smalltooth sawfish before. They\u2019re not sure how\nthey will transport them, whether that\u2019s towing them in a vessel or putting\nthem into a sling, reports the Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Max Chesnes.\n\n\u201cPeople do these rescues for sea turtles, dolphins and manatees all the time,\u201d\nsays Tonya Wiley, founder of Havenworth Coastal Conservation, a research group\nparticipating in the recovery effort, to the Tampa Bay Times. \u201cBut it\u2019s never\nbeen done for a 14-foot sawfish before. We\u2019re blazing a trail here.\u201d\n\nAlready, wildlife officials have ruled out several potential triggers for the\ncurious behavior, including bacterial infections, algal toxins, chemicals and\ncommunicable diseases. Staff with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation\nCommission have also determined that temperature, salinity, pH and dissolved\noxygen were not responsible for the deaths.\n\nThey\u2019re continuing to analyze water samples and perform necropsies on dead\nfish in hopes of identifying the source of the issue. So far, the Florida Fish\nand Wildlife Conservation Commission has sent 12 smalltooth sawfish and\nindividuals of other species to the University of South Alabama for further\nstudy.\n\n\u201cIt almost seems as if it is a neurological response to some kind of agent,\u201d\nsays Michael Crosby, president and chief executive officer of Mote Marine\nLaboratory and Aquarium, to CBS News\u2019 Aliza Chasan. \u201cNot at all sure what it\nis yet, [the] scientific community has not identified a smoking gun as of\nyet.\u201d\n\nSo far, whatever is causing the fish to behave oddly does not seem to be\naffecting humans.\n\nMembers of the public are encouraged to record videos and take pictures of any\nfish they see behaving strangely, then upload them to citizen science\nplatforms like iNaturalist.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also asks people to\nreport any and all smalltooth sawfish sightings\u2014whether behaving normally or\nabnormally\u2014via phone or email: sawfish@myfwc.com and 1-844-472-9347. Any\nsightings of dead fish or fish behaving abnormally can be reported to the\ncommission\u2019s Fish Kill Hotline at 800-636-0511.\n\n\u201cPublic reports are an essential resource for our investigation into this\nevent,\u201d according to the commission.\n\nGet the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.\n\nSarah Kuta | READ MORE\n\nSarah Kuta is a writer and editor based in Longmont, Colorado.
