While this copy\nis undated, it forms part of a manuscript (collecting various Arabic\nscientific texts) bound in the seventeenth century and preserved at Berlin\u2019s\nStaatsbibliothek (Ms. or Fol. 3306).\n\nAl-Jazar\u012b, who passed away in 1206, served as the chief engineer for the court\nof the Artuqids in Diyarbakir. His Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical\nDevices lives up to its name, detailing lock-like devices for raising water,\nsophisticated zodiac clocks, avian automata able to produce song, and a\nshowering system for King Salih, who \u201cdisliked a servant or slave girl pouring\nwater onto his hands for him\u201d. He invented bloodletting technologies,\nmischievous fountains, segmental gears, and a chest (sund\u016bq) that featured a\nsecurity system with four combination dials \u2014 presumably a safe for storing\nvalued possessions \u2014 and has been subsequently dubbed \u201cthe father of\nrobotics\u201d, due to his creation of a life-like butler who could offer guests a\nhand towel after their ablutions. Al-Jazar\u012b\u2019s contemporaries already\nrecognized his eminence as an engineer, referring to him as unique and\nunrivaled, learned and worthy. He stood on the shoulders of Persian, Greek,\nIndian, and Chinese precursors, while Renaissance inventors, in turn, stood on\nhis.\n\nThe Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices contains some fifty\nmechanical devices divided into six categories: clocks; vessels and figures\nfor drinking sessions; pitchers, basins, and other washing devices; fountains\nand perpetual flutes; machines for raising water; and a miscellaneous\ncategory, where we find a self-closing door. The second category is perhaps\nthe most intriguing, and grants some insight into the extravagant concerns of\nal-Jazar\u012b\u2019s courtly patrons. One machine \u2014 \u201ca standing slave holding a fish\nand a goblet from which he serves wine to the king\u201d \u2014 is programmed to\ndispense clarified wine every eighth of an hour for a certain period. Numerous\nsimilar devices follow: robots that drink from goblets, which are filled from\nthe recycled contents of their stomachs; automaton shaykhs that serve each\nother wine that each consumes in turn; a boat full of mechanical slave girls\nthat play instruments during drinking parties. Not unlike our \u201cAI assistants\u201d,\nal-Jazar\u012b\u2019s inventions are never allowed to transcend the category of\nindentured laborer, reproducing the inequalities of social relations across\nthe human-machine divide.\n\nThe illustrations from the Berlin manuscript are notably different than some\nof its sister specimens, such as the ornate pair of manuscripts held in\nLeiden. Here the images are mainly in-line illustrations and seem more focused\non technical details and inner workings than other versions, which tend to\nlean toward aesthetic exteriors. Red and yellow predominate, offset by the\noccasional body of water in indigo blue. Gears and levers are rich in tone,\nwhile humanoid figures get left as simple, colorless sketches. To the\ncontemporary viewer, the illustrations invert the power dynamic that is so\npresent in al-Jazar\u012b\u2019s text. Machines come to the foreground; humans are\nincidental figures, almost irrelevant.\n\nFor more on al-Jazar\u012b\u2019s mechanical devices, visit this helpful webpage.
