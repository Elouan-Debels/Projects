We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a\n> hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk\n> exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin\n> matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times\n> fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences\n> significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the\n> hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference\n> they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale\n> Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for\n> efficient distributed training.\n\nComments:| 25 pages, 11 figures  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2402.19427 [cs.LG]  \n(or arXiv:2402.19427v1 [cs.LG] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.19427arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Aleksandar Botev [view email] [v1] Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:24:46 UTC (260\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Griffin: Mixing Gated Linear Recurrences with\nLocal Attention for Efficient Language Models, by Soham De and 15 other\nauthors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2402\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.CL\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nIArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
