I\nam very saddened, and I will miss him sorely.\u201d\n\nJon Butterworth, a member of the Atlas collaboration, said Higgs was \u201ca hero\nto the particle physics community\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven though he didn\u2019t much enjoy it, he felt a responsibility to use the\npublic profile his achievements brought him for the good of science, and he\ndid so many times. The particle that carries his name is perhaps the single\nmost stunning example of how seemingly abstract mathematical ideas can make\npredictions which turn out to have huge physical consequences.\u201d\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the Nobel, said at the\ntime the standard model of physics which underpins the scientific\nunderstanding of the universe \u201crests on the existence of a special kind of\nparticle: the Higgs particle. This particle originates from an invisible field\nthat fills up all space.\n\n\u201cEven when the universe seems empty this field is there. Without it, we would\nnot exist, because it is from contact with the field that particles acquire\nmass. The theory proposed by Englert and Higgs describes this process.\u201d\n\nAn immensely shy man who disliked the fuss, Higgs had left home for a quiet\nlunch of soup and trout in Leith on the day of the announcement, to be stopped\nby a former neighbour who gave him the news on his way home.\n\nBorn in Newcastle upon Tyne, Higgs leaves two sons, Chris and Jonny, his\ndaughter in law Suzanne and two grandchildren. His wife, Jody, a linguistics\nlecturer from whom he was separated, died in 2008.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Peter Higgs\n  * Higgs boson\n  * Particle physics\n  * Physics\n  * Scotland\n  * Nobel prizes\n  * People in science\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Peter Higgs interview: 'I have this kind of underlying incompetence'\n\n6 Dec 2013\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Peter Higgs: I wouldn't be productive enough for today's academic system\n\n6 Dec 2013\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Cern aims to build \u20ac20bn collider to unlock secrets of universe\n\n5 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Father of 'the God particle' Peter Higgs says fame is a bit of a nuisance\n\n17 Feb 2014\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Cern gears up for more discoveries 10 years after \u2018God particle\u2019 find\n\n4 Jul 2022\n\n  * ### Getting to the bottom of the Higgs boson\n\n17 Jul 2017\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### From gravity to the Higgs we're still waiting for new physics\n\n24 Mar 2017\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### Is the Standard Model isolated?\n\n12 Mar 2017\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
