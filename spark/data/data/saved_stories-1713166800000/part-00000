In this method, we suppose a cascade\nof holograms in which the first hologram is a color image displayed on the\nmobile phone screen. The hologram cascade is synthesized by solving an inverse\nproblem with respect to the propagation of incoherent light. We demonstrate a\nthree-dimensional color image reproduction using a two-layered hologram\ncascade composed of an iPhone and a spatial light modulator.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Optica Publishing Group\n\nFull Article | PDF Article\n\nMore Like This\n\nIncoherent computer-generated holography\n\nRyutaro Suda, Makoto Naruse, and Ryoichi Horisaki Opt.
