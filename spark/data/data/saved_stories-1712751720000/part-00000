A new bipartisan proposal called\nAPRA could break the impasse.\n\nSenator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) has led the charge on a federal data privacy\nbill.Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nCongress may be closer than ever to passing a comprehensive data privacy\nframework after key House and Senate committee leaders released a new proposal\non Sunday.\n\nThe bipartisan proposal, titled the American Privacy Rights Act, or APRA,\nwould limit the types of consumer data that companies can collect, retain, and\nuse, allowing solely what they\u2019d need to operate their services. Users would\nalso be allowed to opt out of targeted advertising, and have the ability to\nview, correct, delete, and download their data from online services. The\nproposal would also create a national registry of data brokers, and force\nthose companies to allow users to opt out of having their data sold.\n\n\u201cThis landmark legislation gives Americans the right to control where their\ninformation goes and who can sell it,\u201d Cathy McMorris Rodgers, House Energy\nand Commerce Committee chair, said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cIt reins in Big\nTech by prohibiting them from tracking, predicting, and manipulating people\u2019s\nbehaviors for profit without their knowledge and consent. Americans\noverwhelmingly want these rights, and they are looking to us, their elected\nrepresentatives, to act.\u201d\n\nFeatured Video\n\nCongress has tried to put together a comprehensive federal law protecting user\ndata for decades. Lawmakers have remained divided, though, on whether that\nlegislation should prevent states from issuing tougher rules, and whether to\nallow a \u201cprivate right of action\u201d that would enable people to sue companies in\nresponse to privacy violations.\n\nIn an interview with The Spokesman Review on Sunday, McMorris Rodgers claimed\nthat the draft\u2019s language is stronger than any active laws, seemingly as an\nattempt to assuage the concerns of Democrats who have long fought attempts to\npreempt preexisting state-level protections. APRA does allow states to pass\ntheir own privacy laws related to civil rights and consumer protections, among\nother exceptions.\n\nIn the previous session of Congress, the leaders of the House Energy and\nCommerce Committees brokered a deal with Roger Wicker, the top Republican on\nthe Senate Commerce Committee, on a bill that would preempt state laws with\nthe exception of the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Biometric\nInformation Privacy Act of Illinois. That measure, titled the American Data\nPrivacy and Protection Act, also created a weaker private right of action than\nmost Democrats were willing to support. Maria Cantwell, Senate Commerce\nCommittee chair, refused to support the measure, instead circulating her own\ndraft legislation. The ADPPA hasn\u2019t been reintroduced, but APRA was designed\nas a compromise.\n\n\u201cI think we have threaded a very important needle here,\u201d Cantwell told The\nSpokesman Review. \u201cWe are preserving those standards that California and\nIllinois and Washington have.\u201d\n\nAPRA includes language from California\u2019s landmark privacy law allowing people\nto sue companies when they are harmed by a data breach. It also provides the\nFederal Trade Commission, state attorneys general, and private citizens the\nauthority to sue companies when they violate the law.\n\nThe categories of data that would be impacted by APRA include certain\ncategories of \u201cinformation that identifies or is linked or reasonably linkable\nto an individual or device,\u201d according to a Senate Commerce Committee summary\nof the legislation. Small businesses\u2014those with $40 million or less in annual\nrevenue and limited data collection\u2014would be exempt under APRA, with\nenforcement focused on businesses with $250 million or more in yearly revenue.\nGovernments and \u201centities working on behalf of governments\u201d are excluded under\nthe bill, as are the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and,\napart from certain cybersecurity provisions, \u201cfraud-fighting\u201d nonprofits.\n\nFrank Pallone, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee,\ncalled the draft \u201cvery strong\u201d in a Sunday statement, but said he wanted to\n\u201cstrengthen\u201d it with tighter child safety provisions.\n\nStill, it remains unclear whether APRA will receive the necessary support for\napproval. On Sunday, committee aids said that conversations on other lawmakers\nsigning onto the legislation are ongoing. The current proposal is a\n\u201cdiscussion draft\u201d; while there\u2019s no official date for introducing a bill,\nCantwell and McMorris Rodgers will likely shop around the text to colleagues\nfor feedback over the coming weeks, and plan to send it to committees this\nmonth.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.
