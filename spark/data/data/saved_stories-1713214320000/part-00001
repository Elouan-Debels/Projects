It\u2019s designed to produce good decisions that are fair and\nmanifest the collective intelligence of the group. And it\u2019s designed to work\nat scale.\n\nThis is not easy, especially on the Internet, where bad-faith actors can\neasily create bots and sock-puppets to try to manipulate the results. And even\nif everyone acts in good faith, collective intelligence does not always scale\nwell. Large groups often fail to come to consensus on even basic facts, let\nalone optimal actions.\n\nBut in this essay I argue that intelligent group decision-making can scale\nwith the right process.\n\nA deliberative consensus protocol is like a blockchain consensus protocol,\nwhich induces users to give honest answers to questions of sufficiently\nuncontroversial facts (such as the state of the blockchain). But unlike a\nblockchain consensus protocol, which only works when there is no honest\ndisagreement about the correct answer, a deliberative consensus protocol does\nnot punish disagreement. Instead, it rewards honest opinions. It then uses a\ndeliberative process to discover the most informed and unbiased opinion of the\ngroup.\n\nAlthough it is like a blockchain consensus protocol, a deliberative consensus\nprotocol does not require a blockchain. It can be used anywhere an online\ngroup needs to make decisions: governance of open-source projects and DAOs,\ndirect democracy, open fact-checking and peer review, moderating online\nforums, or improving social-media ranking algorithms to combat misinformation.\n\nBut a deliberative consensus protocol can facilitate not just more intelligent\ndecisions, but also more intelligent conversations, by promoting a more\nhealthy conversation dynamic that incentivizes informed honesty, rather than\ndishonest conformity.\n\n## Fair Decisions\n\nBlockchain protocols consistently (and amazingly) produce a consensus on the\ntruth when it comes to questions of unambiguous, uncontroversial fact. For an\nintuition of just how this miracle occurs, read my essay on Truthtelling\nGames.\n\nUnfortunately, no protocol can consistently give us the \u201ctruth\u201d when the facts\nare uncertain or subjective, or when values or preferences conflict. The best\nwe can do is try to create a protocol that produces the most fair decision.\n\nWhat constitutes a fair decision? Well, let\u2019s consider some examples of unfair\ndecisions. In a criminal trial, if exculpatory evidence is withheld, that\u2019s\nunfair. If the jurors are bribed to not give their honest opinion, that\u2019s\nunfair. And if the jury isn\u2019t representative of the defendant\u2019s peers, that\u2019s\nalso unfair.\n\nSo I would propose that a fair trail would be one that discovers the 1) honest\nand 2) fully-informed opinion of an 3) unbiased jury.\n\nThis is what a deliberative consensus protocol is designed to do. It uses a\ndeliberative process to discover what an unbiased (e.g. representative) sample\nof the group would honestly believe after they have considered all the most\ninformative \u2013 or convincing \u2013 comments made by other users.\n\nTo accomplish this, the protocol uses three different technologies, that\ncorrect in turn for 1) dishonesty, 2) ignorance, and 3) bias.\n\n## 1) Correcting for Dishonesty using Game Theory\n\nFirst, to address the problem of dishonesty and coordinated manipulation, a\ndeliberative consensus protocol can use game-theoretical mechanisms such as\nthe Bayesian truth serum. BTS is an extraordinary mechanism (developed at MIT)\nthat rewards users for giving honest answers even if users believe that most\npeople disagree with them.\n\nTo make these game-theoretical mechanisms work, there must be some sort of\nreward. If a deliberative consensus protocol is not a blockchain protocol, and\nthe reward is not cryptocurrency, then what is the reward?\n\nIn the deliberative consensus protocol, the reward currency can be attention.\nAs I argue in The Law Of Attention, if nobody pays any attention to your posts\nin an online platform, you will stop posting. If your votes have no effect on\nother posts, you will stop voting.\n\nSo using a reputation system where reputation translates to the ability to\ninfluence the attention of other users, we can use an increase or decrease in\nreputation as the reward currency. This allows a deliberative consensus\nprotocol to fully employ the tools of game theory and mechanism design, and\nengineer a protocol that creates an equilibrium where everyone answers\nhonestly, because they expect other users to do the same.\n\n## 2) Correcting for Ignorance using Deliberation\n\nSecond, to address the problem of ignorance, a deliberative consensus protocol\ncan use an algorithm such as the Global brain algorithm to curate\nconversations that discover the most convincing arguments on each side of a\nquestion, in order to determine the opinion of users who have considered all\nof these arguments.\n\nThe global brain algorithm works by analyzing a threaded conversation tree and\nconsidering the upvotes and downvotes on each comment, depending on who has\nseen what other comments before they voted. It then filters and ranks comments\nto influence how much attention each receives, in order to deepen the most\ninformed conversation threads while pruning uninformative threads that do not\neffect voting behavior.\n\nThe integration of a truthtelling protocol such as the Bayesian Truth Serum\nwith a deliberative protocol such as the Global Brain Algorithm can produce an\nequilibrium at informed honesty, where users maximize their influence on the\nplatform by voting according to their honest opinion given the information\nthat has been shown to them.\n\nThis is the opposite of the effect of many social media algorithms, which\ncreate an equilibrium on dishonest conformity: where people are rewarded for\nposts that are easily recognized as conforming to the biases and dogmas of the\ngroup, even if that requires ignoring nuance and reason.\n\n## 3) Correcting for Bias using Machine Learning\n\nHowever, even if all members of a group are honest and informed of the most\nconvincing information and arguments posted by other users, the result will\nstill depend on who you ask, because people have different core values, belief\nsystems, and preferences. And because participation in online discussions is\nnecessarily optional, votes will often be a biased sample of the opinions of\nthe group.\n\nTo address this problem of self-selection bias, an unsupervised machine-\nlearning algorithm can be used discover latent factors that predictably affect\nusers\u2019 votes, and adjust for these biases so that the results are\nrepresentative of the overall opinions of the group. A similar algorithm is\nused by X\u2019s Community Notes to correct for political bias.\n\n## Summary\n\nA deliberative consensus protocol does not solve all the problems of group\ndecision-making. For example, the dilemmas in designing fair democratic voting\nmechanisms addressed by social choice theory still exist when there are\nconflicting goals and preferences. But a deliberative consensus protocol can\nenhanced online group decision-making processes by more effectively\ndistributing information and producing a fair decision that represents the\ncollective intelligence of the group.\n\nBut the greatest potential of these protocols may simply be the improvement in\ndiscourse. In a sense, the most important decision for any group to make is\nhow to allocate their attention. In any online discussion platform, the global\nbrain algorithm can be used to focus attention on the most informative\nconversation threads and on comments that stand up to scrutiny, thereby\npromoting deep, honest, informed, and intelligent conversations.\n\n  * RSS\n  * GitHub\n  * Mastodon\n  * Medium\n  * Substack\n  * Twitter\n  * Made with\n\n", "frontpage": true}
