(AP) \u2014 South Florida researchers trying to prevent\npredatory fish from devouring laboratory-grown coral are grasping at\nbiodegradable straws in an effort to restore what some call the rainforest of\nthe sea.\n\nScientists around the world have been working for years to address the decline\nof coral reef populations. Just last summer, reef rescue groups in South\nFlorida and the Florida Keys were trying to save coral from rising ocean\ntemperatures. Besides working to keep existing coral alive, researchers have\nalso been growing new coral in labs and then placing them in the ocean.\n\nBut protecting the underwater ecosystem that maintains upwards of 25% of all\nmarine species is not easy. Even more challenging is making sure that coral\ngrown in a laboratory and placed into the ocean doesn\u2019t become expensive fish\nfood.\n\nMarine researcher Kyle Pisano said one problem is that predators like parrot\nfish attempt to bite and destroy the newly transplanted coral in areas like\nSouth Florida, leaving them with less than a 40% survival rate. With projects\ncalling for thousands of coral to be planted over the next year and tens of\nthousands of coral to be planted over the next decade, the losses add up when\ncoral pieces can cost more than $100 each.\n\nPisano and his partner, Kirk Dotson, have developed the Coral Fort, claiming\nthe small biodegradable cage that\u2019s made in part with drinking straws boosts\nthe survival rate of transplanted coral to over 90%.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nBook Review: Hampton Sides revisits Captain James Cook, a divisive figure in\nthe South Pacific\n\nWhat is a whale native to the North Pacific doing off New England? Climate\nchange could be the key\n\nStudy says 2023\u2019s crazy Atlantic ocean heat, low Antarctic sea ice give\nglimpse of much hotter world\n\n\u201cParrot fish on the reef really, really enjoy biting a newly transplanted\ncoral,\u201d Pisano said. \u201cThey treat it kind of like popcorn.\u201d\n\nFortunately the fish eventually lose interest in the coral as it matures, but\nscientists need to protect the coral in the meantime. Stainless steel and PVC\npipe barriers have been set up around transplanted coral in the past, but\nthose barriers needed to be cleaned of algae growth and eventually removed.\n\nPisano had the idea of creating a protective barrier that would eventually\ndissolve, eliminating the need to maintain or remove it. He began conducting\noffshore experiments with biodegradable coral cages as part of a master\u2019s\ndegree program at Nova Southeastern University. He used a substance called\npolyhydroxyalkanoate, a biopolymer derived from the fermentation of canola\noil. PHA biodegrades in ocean, leaving only water and carbon dioxide. His\nfindings were published last year.\n\nThe coral cage consists of a limestone disc surrounded by eight vertical phade\nbrand drinking straws, made by Atlanta-based WinCup Inc. The device doesn\u2019t\nhave a top, Pisano said, because the juvenile coral needs sunlight and the\nparrot fish don\u2019t generally want to position themselves facing downward to\neat.\n\nDotson, a retired aerospace engineer, met Pisano through his professor at Nova\nSoutheastern, and the two formed Reef Fortify Inc. to further develop and\nmarket the patent-pending Coral Fort. The first batch of cages were priced at\n$12 each, but Pisano and Dotson believe that could change as production scales\nup.\n\nEarly prototypes of the cage made from phade\u2019s standard drinking straws were\nable to protect the coral for about two months before dissolving in the ocean,\nbut that wasn\u2019t quite long enough to outlast the interest of parrot fish. When\nPisano and Dotson reached out to phade for help, the company assured them that\nit could make virtually any custom shape from its biodegradable PHA material.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s turning out that the boba straws, straight out of the box, work just\nfine,\u201d Dotson said.\n\nBoba straws are wider and thicker than normal drinking straws. They\u2019re used\nfor a tea-based drink that includes tapioca balls at the bottom of the cup.\nFor Pisano and Dotson, that extra thickness means the straws last just long\nenough to protect the growing coral before harmlessly disappearing.\n\nReef Fortify is hoping to work with reef restoration projects all over the\nworld. The Coral Forts already already being used by researchers at Nova\nSoutheastern and the University of Miami, as well as Hawaii\u2019s Division of\nAquatic Resources.\n\nRich Karp, a coral researcher at the University of Miami, said they\u2019ve been\nusing the Coral Forts for about a month. He pointed out that doing any work\nunderwater takes a great deal of time and effort, so having a protective cage\nthat dissolves when it\u2019s no longer needed basically cuts their work in half.\n\n\u201cSimply caging corals and then removing the cages later, that\u2019s two times the\namount of work, two times the amount of bottom time,\u201d Karp said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not\nreally scalable.\u201d\n\nExperts say coral reefs are a significant part of the oceanic ecosystem. They\noccupy less than 1% of the ocean worldwide but provide food and shelter to\nnearly 25 percent of sea life. Coral reefs also help to protect humans and\ntheir homes along the coastline from storm surges during hurricanes.\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to\nfactual reporting.
