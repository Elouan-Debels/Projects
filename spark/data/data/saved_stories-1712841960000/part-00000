My journey has introduced me to diverse communities, cultures,\nand \"benevolent dictators for life,\" teaching me the critical importance of\nencouraging participation in the development of software we rely on.\n\n## Beyond Code: The Essence of Open Source\n\nMario S\u00e9rgio and me\n\nOpen source is also about evangelizing and helping on board new members\n\nWhile software consists of instructions, data, or programs designed to perform\nspecific tasks, open-source software embodies more. Successful projects demand\nvarious skills: robust documentation, a welcoming community to guide\nnewcomers, issue triage by diligent managers, and enthusiastic evangelists to\ngrow the project's reach.\n\nMajor projects like Linux, Kubernetes, and Python benefit from corporate\nbacking, providing essential resources and support. Meanwhile, community-\nmanaged initiatives like Plone thrive thanks to a dedicated volunteer base.\nProjects such as FastAPI or Py5 seem powered by tireless individuals capable\nof significant contributions across multiple roles.\n\n## Your Contribution Is Needed Now\n\nEvery open-source project you use and depend on needs your help. Contribution\nextends beyond code; it's about caring for the tools you use. Consider it akin\nto maintaining a shared garden with your neighbors: not everyone needs a green\nthumb. Contributions can range from maintenance tasks to financial support,\nall vital for the garden's prosperity.\n\n## How You Can Contribute\n\n  * Engage in online help forums.\n  * Offer assistance to newcomers.\n  * Report bugs.\n  * Contribute to or review documentation.\n  * Share your project experiences through posts or talks.\n  * Express your gratitude for projects on social media.\n  * Translate content into languages you're fluent in.\n  * Donate to support project maintainers.\n\nIn recent years, my contributions have spanned code to supporting entities and\nindividuals vital to the open source ecosystem:\n\n  * The Plone Foundation, fostering the CMS and its community.\n  * Tiangolo (Sebasti\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez), for giving the world FastAPI and Typer.\n  * Dunossauro, for his invaluable content for the Brazilian community.\n  * Fosstodon, a key space in the Fediverse.\n  * Py5, essential for my daily creative endeavors.\n  * Alexandre Villares, an exceptional programming educator.\n\nAlexandre Villares\n\nNoite de Processing\n\nDunossauro and a fan\n\n## Act Now: Your Support Matters\n\nYour support keeps the open-source ecosystem alive; Choose a way to contribute\nand take action today. Even if you lack time, funds, or specific skills, a\nsimple \"thank you\" on social media to maintainers and community members can\nmake a huge difference.\n\nPython,Community,Open Source,Plone\n\nPowered by Plone & Python\n\n", "frontpage": false}
