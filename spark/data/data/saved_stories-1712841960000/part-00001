Ultimately, I couldn't find a way to include it in my\nresearch - so you're getting my cast offs.\n\nSo, I present to you some choice predictions from \"Technology and the office\nof the future\" by B. W. Manley.\n\nLow cost computers (VDU) - yup! Data storage - the article talks about storing\n\"the entire contents of the Encyclopaedia Britannica on one side of a disc \u2014\nwords and pictures\".\n\nDigital networking! Brilliant! Voice Command! Wait... what?\n\nBy 1991 we didn't really have practical voice recognition systems. And\ncertainly nothing that could replace the keyboard. Here we are FORTY YEARS\nlater and most of us are thumping away on keyboards for long-form writing. If\nwe're driving, we can scream \"CALL MUM\" and Siri will probably get it right.\nAnd there's the occasional use of voice recognition to compose a quick text.\nBut we're not in 1981's future yet.\n\nWhat about video? Sadly, too expensive and not useful enough.\n\nAfter a year of COVID, I think we can all agree that Zoom has encouraged more\nmeetings than are strictly necessary!\n\nThe humble FAX was about to become the big tech of the 1980s. Sadly, some\nplaces are still stuck with it - despite the obvious limitations.\n\n## What have we learned today?\n\nPredicting the future is hard. Saying that something will always be too\nexpensive is never a good bet.\n\nKnowing that a technology has serious shortcomings - like not being able to\nsearch a fax - is irrelevant when it is simply a more convenient version of\nthe existing paradigm.\n\nUnintended consequences are the most exciting part of any technology. We don't\nuse voice control in a noisy, open plan office - but we use it at home.\nVideocalls do increase the number of meetings - as predicted - but they also\ndo slash travel budgets.\n\nWhat's your favourite prediction from the 1980s?\n\n## Share this post on...\n\n  * Mastodon\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * HackerNews\n  * Lobsters\n  * Pocket\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Telegram\n\n## The AlgorithmTM suggests:\n\n  * Rejected Sci-Fi Ramblings from my MSc\n\n2023\n\n  * MSc Dissertation: Exploring the visualisation of hierarchical cybersecurity data within the Metaverse\n\n2023\n\n  * MSc - completed!\n\n2023\n\n  * MSc: \"So, You Have to Write a Literature Review\"\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n2022\n\n## One thought on \u201cPredicting The Future - What 1981 Got Wrong\u201d\n\n  1. 2021-04-11 13:58\n\n### Alex Gibson says:\n\nHoverboards.
