The UPC aim\nto legalize software patents in Europe, without any intervention possible of\nthe European Court of Justice (CJEU), with part-time technical judges working\nalso for large corporations such as Nokia or Airbus.\n\nTwo days before the launch of the Unified Patent Court (UPC), former CJEU\u2019s\nAvocate general Melchior Wathelet said in a conference that the whole\nconstruction was running against the jurisprudence of the CJEU on \u2018Autonomy of\nEU law\u2019, as National Courts cannot be removed from interpreting EU law by the\nUnified Patent Court.\n\nMelchior Wathelet mentioned the jurisprudence Achmea (on which he issued an\nopinion as Avocate general) where the CJEU declared an intra-EU investment\ncourt between the Netherlands and Slovakia as not being a \u2018Common Court\u2019\nbetween Member States, as the UPC claims to be. This investment court had to\ninterpret EU law, without any link to National Courts, the guardians of EU\nlaw. The Court found such international investment court was an infringement\nof Art267TFEU.\n\nFFII attended the conference, and it was mentioned that Art267TFEU was raised\nin front of the German Constitutional Court, but the Court found a way not to\nescalate the question to the CJEU, using a dubious excuse that the complainant\nwas not directly \u201cconcerned\u201d by the issue.\n\nThe Unified Patent Court has to interpret EU law, such as the 2004\nIntellectual Property Enforcement Directive (IPRED), outside of National\nCourts.\n\nThe UPCA was designed to ignore the 2011 Opinion 1/09 on the previous attempt\nto install a pan-European Patent Court (UPLS):\n\n> 80\\. While it is true that the Court has no jurisdiction to rule on direct\n> actions between individuals in the field of patents, since that jurisdiction\n> is held by the courts of the Member States, nonetheless the Member States\n> cannot confer the jurisdiction to resolve such disputes on a court created\n> by an international agreement which would deprive those courts of their\n> task, as \u2018ordinary\u2019 courts within the European Union legal order, to\n> implement European Union law and, thereby, of the power provided for in\n> Article 267 TFEU, or, as the case may be, the obligation, to refer questions\n> for a preliminary ruling in the field concerned.\n>\n> 81\\. The draft agreement provides for a preliminary ruling mechanism which\n> reserves, within the scope of that agreement, the power to refer questions\n> for a preliminary ruling to the Patent Court (PC) while removing that power\n> from the national courts.\n>\n> CJEU Opinion 1/09 para 80 and 81 eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-\n> content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:62009CV0001\n\nWhile the validity of the UPCA Treaty itself could not be directly challenged\nat the CJEU, since the EU is not party to the Agreement, however a part of the\nEU law (the Brussels1 regulation) had to be modified to say that the Unified\nPatent Court is a \u2018common court\u2019 to the Member States, on the same level as\nthe Benelux Court of Justice, which involves National Courts:\n\n> For the purposes of this Regulation, each of the following courts shall be a\n> common court: (a) the Unified Patent Court established by the Agreement on a\n> Unified Patent Court signed on 19 February 2013 (the \u2018UPC Agreement\u2019); and\n> (b) the Benelux Court of Justice established by the Treaty of 31 March 1965\n> concerning the establishment and statute of a Benelux Court of Justice (the\n> \u2018Benelux Court of Justice Treaty\u2019).\n>\n> BRUSSELS1, REGULATION (EU) No 542/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE\n> COUNCIL of 15 May 2014 amending Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 as regards the\n> rules to be applied with respect to the Unified Patent Court and the Benelux\n> Court of Justice, eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-\n> content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0542\n\nAny EU citizen, a company or an association could ask a National Court to\nverify the validity of such regulation, and ask a preducial question to the\nCJEU.\n\n#### References\n\nCRIDES Conference \u201cThe Unitary Patent Package (30.05.23) THE UNITARY PATENT\nPACKAGE: A START ON SHAKY TRACKS?\u201d https://uclouvain.be/fr/instituts-\nrecherche/juri/crides/evenements/conference-the-unitary-patent-\npackage-30-05-23.html\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related News\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n### Support the FFII\n\nThe FFII is funded through individual membership fees as well as through\ndonations from individuals, civil society organizations, and enterprises.\nPlease consider becoming a contributing member and donate to our cause.
