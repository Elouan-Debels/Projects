A Sunday\nPhantom strip was added to newspapers on May 28, 1939.^[4] During Moore's\nWorld War II military service, he left the strip to his assistant, Wilson\nMcCoy. Upon Moore's return, he worked on the strip on and off until 1949, when\nMcCoy succeeded him.^[5] Following McCoy's death in 1961, Carmine Infantino\nand Bill Lignante (who would later draw several Phantom stories directly for\ncomic books) filled in before Sy Barry was chosen as a successor.^[6] Barry\nwould continue working on the strip for over 30 years before retiring in\n1994.^[7]\n\nBarry's longtime assistant, George Olesen, remained on the strip as penciller,\nwith Keith Williams joining as the inker for the daily strip.^[citation\nneeded] The Sunday strip was inked by Eric Doescher until Fred Fredericks\nbecame the regular inker in 1995.^[citation needed]\n\nFalk continued to script Phantom until his death on March 13, 1999. His last\ndaily and Sunday strip stories, \"Terror at the Opera\" and \"The Kidnappers\",\nrespectively, were finished by his wife, Elizabeth Falk, after the\nhospitalized Falk had torn off his oxygen mask to dictate the adventures.^[8]\nAfter Falk's passing, King Features Syndicate collaborated with the European\ncomics publisher Egmont on the strip. They went from initially publishing\nPhantom stories in licensed comic books to providing the stories for the\nnewspaper strip by adapting their own comic-book stories. Tony DePaul and\nClaes Reimerthi alternated as writers of the daily and Sunday newspaper\nstrips, respectively. DePaul would later become the sole writer of the strip.\n\nIn 2000, Olesen and Fredericks retired from the Sunday strip, which was then\ntaken over by artist Graham Nolan. Olesen and Williams left the daily strip\nafter Olesen retired, and artist Paul Ryan took over the daily in early 2005.\nRyan succeeded Nolan as artist on the Sunday strip in 2007.^[9] On July 31,\n2011, Eduardo Barreto became the Sunday artist. Barreto died after only a few\nmonths of working on the strip, and Ryan did the January 15, 2012, Sunday page\nand the following week's comics before Terry Beatty became Barreto's permanent\nreplacement.^[10]\n\n### Comic books[edit]\n\nSee also: The Phantom \u00a7 Internationally\n\nThrough the 1940s, The Phantom strips were reprinted in David McKay\nPublications' Ace Comics. The following decade, Harvey Comics published The\nPhantom comic book. In 1962, Gold Key Comics took over, followed by King\nComics in 1966 and Charlton Comics in 1969. This lasted until 1977, with a\ntotal of 73 issues being published. Some of the main Phantom artists during\nthese years were Bill Lignante, Don Newton, Jim Aparo, and Pat Boyette.^[11]\n\nDC Comics published a Phantom comic book from 1988 to 1990. The initial\nminiseries (dated May\u2013August 1988) were written by Peter David and drawn by\nJoe Orlando and Dennis Janke. The subsequent series, written by Mark Verheiden\nand drawn by Luke McDonnell, ran for 13 issues (March 1989 \u2013 March 1990).^[12]\n\nIn 1987, Marvel Comics published a four-issue miniseries based on the\nDefenders of the Earth TV series, written by Stan Lee. A subsequent three-\nissue Marvel miniseries, The Phantom: The Ghost Who Walks (Feb.-April 1995),\nwas written and drawn by David de Vries and Glenn Lumsden. Marvel released\nanother four-issue miniseries (May\u2013August 1995) pencilled by Spider-Man co-\ncreator Steve Ditko, based on the Phantom 2040 TV series.^[13] One issue\nfeatured a pin-up by the original two Spider-Man signature artists, Ditko and\nJohn Romita Sr.\n\nBeginning in 2002, Moonstone Books published five Phantom graphic novels,\nwritten by Tom DeFalco, Ben Raab, and Ron Goulart. In 2003, Moonstone debuted\na Phantom comic-book series written by Raab, Rafael Nieves, and Chuck Dixon,\nand drawn by artists including Pat Quinn, Jerry DeCaire, Nick Derington, Rich\nBurchett, and EricJ. After 11 issues, Mike Bullock took over scripting, with\nGabriel Rearte and Carlos Magno creating the artwork before Silvestre Szilagyi\nbecame the regular artist in 2007.^[14] In 2006, Moonstone published a retcon\nof the Phantom's origin, called Legacy, by Raab and Quinn. That same year, the\ncompany published a hybrid comic book and prose book it called \"wide-vision\",\npremiering the format with the Phantom story \"Law of the Jungle\". Moonstone\nalso released the first American Phantom annual. A second annual teamed up the\nPhantom with Mandrake the Magician.^[citation needed]\n\nIn 2009, Moonstone re-launched the series as The Phantom: Ghost Who Walks,\nstarting with issue #0 (an origin retelling).^[15] That same year, Moonstone\nlaunched the 21 issue series Phantom Generations, with each of the 21 Phantoms\nspotlighted in his own story, by different creative teams including writers\nBen Raab, Tom DeFalco, Tony Bedard, Will Murray, and Mike Bullock, and artists\nincluding Pat Quinn, Alex Saviuk, Don Hudson, Scott Brooks, and Zeu.^[citation\nneeded] Moonstone also published \"Phantom Action\", written by Mike Bullock,\nthat depicted the Phantom meeting Captain Action, a five-issue black-and-white\nminiseries called \"The Phantom Double Shot: KGB Noir\", and a two-issue\nminiseries, \"The Phantom: Unmasked\".^[citation needed]\n\nIn August 2010, Dynamite Entertainment debuted the monthly series The Last\nPhantom, by writer Scott Beatty and artist Eduardo Ferigato, with covers\npainted by Alex Ross.^[16]^[17] In 2013, the Phantom appeared in Dynamite's\nfive-issue miniseries Kings Watch. The story, written by Jeff Parker and drawn\nby Marc Laming, saw the Phantom teaming up with Flash Gordon and Mandrake the\nMagician to fight Ming the Merciless and prevent his attempt to take over the\nplanet.^[18]\n\nIn 2014, Hermes Press announced the publication of a Phantom comic-book\nminiseries written by Peter David and illustrated by Sal Velluto.^[19] It\ndebuted October 31, 2014.^[20] For Free Comic Book Day 2015, Hermes published\na Phantom comic book with art by Bill Lignante and samples of the new\nminiseries.^[21]\n\n## Fictional character biography[edit]\n\nIn the jungles of the fictional African country of Bangalla,^[22] there is a\nmyth featuring The Ghost Who Walks, a powerful and indestructible guardian of\nthe innocent and fighter of all types of injustice. Because he seems to have\nexisted for generations, many believe him to be immortal. In reality, the\nPhantom is a legacy hero, descended from 20 previous generations of\ncrimefighters who all adopt the same persona. When a new Phantom takes the\ntask from his dying father, he swears the Oath of the Skull: \"I swear to\ndevote my life to the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty, and injustice, in\nall their forms, and my sons and their sons shall follow me\". The first\nPhantom married Christina, the daughter of a Norwegian sea captain, Eric the\nRover. The second Phantom married Marabella, the granddaughter of Christopher\nColumbus.^[23]\n\nThe comic sometimes runs flashback adventures of previous Phantoms written by\nvarious authors who sometimes confuse Phantom history. Current stories have\nMarabella as the daughter of Columbus and marrying the first\nPhantom.^[24]^[25] As Columbus died in 1506 while, according to the new\nhistory, Marabella first meets the Phantom in 1544, this results in another\ninconsistency, requiring her to be at least 38 years old despite being\ndepicted as in her early 20s. Inconsistencies in storylines and histories are\nnot corrected as a mark of respect to authors, but Falk's original history\ntakes precedence.^[26]\n\nAlthough most of the Phantoms have been male, there has been one woman who\ntook up the role: Julie Walker, twin sister of the 17th Phantom. While her\nbrother was injured, Julie donned the Phantom costume and defeated a band of\npirates.^[27]^[28]\n\nThe present Phantom is the 21st in the line. Unlike most costumed heroes, he\nhas no superhuman powers, relying only on his wits, physical strength, skill\nwith his weapons, and fearsome reputation to fight crime. His real name is Kit\nWalker. References to \"Mr. Walker\" are in the strip often accompanied by a\nfootnote saying \"For 'The Ghost Who Walks'\", although some versions of the\nPhantom's history suggest that Walker was actually the original surname of the\nman who became the first Phantom.\n\n### Origin[edit]\n\nThe story of the Phantom started with a young sailor named Christopher Walker\n(sometimes called Christopher Standish in certain versions of the story^[29]).\nChristopher was born in 1516 in Portsmouth.^[30] His father, also named\nChristopher Walker, had been a seaman since he was a young boy, and was the\ncabin boy on Christopher Columbus' ship, the Santa Mar\u00eda, when he sailed to\nthe Americas. Christopher Jr. became a shipboy on his father's ship in 1526.\n\nIn 1536, when Christopher was 20 years old, he was a part of what was supposed\nto be his father's last voyage. The ship was attacked somewhere in the Bay of\nBengal ^[31] by pirates and Christopher's father was murdered. He was the sole\nsurvivor and was washed ashore on a Bengalla beach, where he was found by\npygmies of the Bandar tribe, who nursed him back to health and took care of\nhim.^[32] He vows revenge on \"the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty, and\ninjustice, in all their forms!\"^[33]\n\nThe Bandars showed Christopher to a cave, which resembled a human skull in\nappearance. Christopher later carved the features out to enhance this. The\nSkull Cave became his home.^[34]\n\nWearing a costume based on the demon god, Christopher became the first of what\nwould later be known as the Phantom. When he died, his son took over for him,\nwhen the second Phantom died, his son took over, and so on. So it would go on\nthrough the centuries, causing people to believe that the Phantom was\nimmortal. These people gave him nicknames including \"The Ghost Who Walks\" and\n\"The Man Who Cannot Die\".^[35]\n\nHis base is in the Deep Woods of Bengali (originally \"Bengalla\", or \"Bangalla\"\nand renamed Denkali in the Indian edition^[36]), a fictional country initially\nsaid to be set in Asia, near India, but depicted as in Africa during and after\nthe 1960s. The Phantom's base is the fabled Skull Cave, where all of the\nprevious Phantoms are buried.\n\nThe Phantom is the commander of Bangalla's Jungle Patrol.^[37] Because of a\nbetrayal leading to the death of the 14th Phantom, the identity of the\ncommander has been kept hidden from members of the patrol ever since. The\nPhantom uses several ways to stay in contact. These include radio and a safe\nwith a false bottom.\n\nMap of countries printing The Phantom as of 2006^[update]. Green countries\nhave regular Phantom publications, while blue countries print the\ndailies/Sundays in newspapers.\n\n### Kit Walker, the 21st Phantom[edit]\n\nThe 21st Phantom's birth name is Kit Walker, as was the name of many of the\nPhantoms before him. Kit was born in Skull Cave and spent his first years in\nthe jungle of Bangalla. His mother, Maud Thorne McPatrick, who had previously\nworked as Rita Hayworth's stunt double, was born in Mississippi, where Kit was\nsent to study when he was 12 years old, living with his aunt Lucy and uncle\nJasper in the town of Clarksville, Missouri.\n\nHere, he met his wife-to-be, Diana Palmer. Kit was an extremely talented\nsportsman and was predicted to become the world champion in many different\nevents (even knocking out the world heavyweight boxing champion in a sparring\nmatch when the champion visited Clarksville). Despite the opportunity to\nchoose practically any career he wanted, Kit faithfully returned to Bengalla\nto take over the role of the Phantom when he received word from Guran that his\nfather was dying from a knife wound.^[38]\n\nOne of Kit's first missions as the Phantom was to find his father's killer,\nRama Singh, who had betrayed and murdered the 20th Phantom by first helping\nhim to blow up a fleet of ships owned by the Singh Brotherhood, only to then\nstab him in the back, stealing his special gunbelt in the process. The 21st\nPhantom eventually found him and reclaimed the belt at the island of Gullique,\nbut before he could avenge his father and bring the killer to jail, the\ndesperate Rama blew up his lair, killing himself and his henchmen in the\nprocess.^[39]\n\nThe Phantom has several animal helpers: the mountain wolf Devil, the horse\nHero, and the falcon Fraka. From 1962 on, The Phantom raised an orphan named\n\"Rex King\", who was later revealed to be the prince of the kingdom of\nBaronkhan. He also has two dolphins named Solomon and Nefertiti, and numerous\nother animals kept on the island of Eden.\n\nIn 1978, he married his sweetheart, Diana Palmer, who works at the United\nNations. The Phantom and Diana have two children, Kit and Heloise.^[40] His\nchief aide and ally is Guran, chief of the local pygmy Bandar tribe, who are\nthe only tribe to know the Phantom's true nature. Guran has been the Phantom's\nbest friend since childhood and a supporter of his cause. Other allies of the\n21st Phantom include Doctor Axel, a Scandinavian doctor working in\nBangalla,^[41] and Miss Tagama, the African teacher of Rex, Kit and\nHeloise.^[42]\n\n### Costume and weapons[edit]\n\nAs part of the official uniform, the Phantom wears a black domino mask and a\npurple skintight bodysuit. He also carries period-appropriate sidearms,\ncurrently two M1911 pistols^[43] in a special belt with a skull-like buckle.\nFalk has insisted that the Phantom only uses his guns to shoot out the guns of\nhis opponents, a fact that writer Peter David was unaware of when he wrote DC\nComics' 1988 four-issue Phantom miniseries, in which he had the Phantom shoot\nto wound his enemies.^[44] However, there are some early instances (in the Lee\nFalk strips) of the Phantom using his guns to shoot and kill people (sometimes\nin self-defense).\n\nWhile there had been masked crime fighters like the costumed Zorro, The\nShadow, or the business-suited The Clock, the Phantom was the first fictional\ncharacter to wear the skintight costume and eyes with no visible pupils that\nhas become a trademark of superheroes. Creator Lee Falk had originally\nenvisioned a gray costume and even considered naming his creation \"The Gray\nGhost\". It was not until the Phantom Sunday strip debuted in 1939 that the\ncostume was shown to be purple. Falk, however, continued to refer to the\ncostume as gray in the text of the strip on several occasions afterward, but\nfinally accepted the purple color.^[45] In a Sunday strip story published in\nthe 1960s it was shown that the first Phantom chose the costume based on the\nappearance of a jungle idol, and colored the cloth with purple jungle berries.\n\nAs part of a modernization of the character in the Moonstone Books' series,\nThe Phantom: Ghost Who Walks, the Phantom began wearing a costume made of\nkevlar.^[46]\n\n### The Phantom Rings[edit]\n\nA signature of the character is his two rings. One has a pattern formed like\nfour crossing sabres, \"The Good Mark\", that he leaves on visitors whom he\nbefriends, placing the person under his protection. The other, \"The Evil Mark\"\nor \"Skull Mark\" has a skull shape, which leaves a scar of the corresponding\nshape on the enemies he punches with it. He wears the Good Mark on his left\nhand because it is closer to the heart, and the Evil Mark on his right hand.\nAccording to the Team Fantomen stories, the Skull Ring was given to the first\nPhantom by Paracelsus.^[47] The original owner of the Skull Ring was Emperor\nNero of the Roman empire and it would later be revealed that the ring had been\nmade from the nails that hung Jesus to the cross. The Good Mark ring was made\nafter the sixth Phantom founded the Jungle Patrol.^[48]\n\n### Enemies[edit]\n\nThe most dangerous and lasting enemy of the Phantom is the Singh Brotherhood,\nactive for centuries and responsible for the death of the 21st Phantom's\nfather.^[49] In the 1970s, Falk's comics changed the group's name to the\n\"Sengh Brotherhood\", or \"Sanngh Brotherhood\". This is because \"Singh\" is a\ncommon name in India, and Falk wished to avoid offending Indian readers by\nimplying that the organization originated in that country.^[50] The group's\nname was changed to \"the Singa Pirates\" in the Indian comics for the same\nreason.^[36] In Egmont's Phantom comics, the brotherhood has evolved into a\nmodern company called Singh Corporations.\n\nAnother criminal organization that the Phantom repeatedly clashes with is the\nSky Band, a group of all-female air pirates.^[49] Frequent antagonists of\nsuccessive Phantoms are the depraved inhabitants of the \"Eastern Dark\" region\n(also known as \"Dakk\") who carry out human sacrifice and drug trafficking. The\nPhantom's repeated role in thwarting the activities of the Dakk people is the\nsource of his \"Guardian of the Eastern Dark\" title.^[51]^[52] Recurring\nvillainous characters in the newspaper strips are pirate leader Baron\nGrover,^[50] terrorist commander Skul,^[50] warmonger General Bababu, and\ninternational terrorist The Python. Antagonists in the Team Fantomen stories\ninclude larcenous art collector Jason Parnassos,^[50] thief Vasti Riba,^[53]\ndictator Prince Grigor,^[50] murderous treasure hunter Bail, and Goldhand,\nnamed for his prosthetic hand made of solid gold.^[54] A major threat to the\nPhantom was Kigali Lubanga, the President of Bengalla for several years.^[55]\nFoes of the Phantom in the Moonstone stories include disfigured kickboxer\nManuel Ortega,^[56] Ali Gutaale and HIM.^[57] Other enemies of the Phantom\ninclude Rebecca Madison (in the Phantom 2040 series), and Xander Drax (in the\n1996 film). Another villainous gang that has been a sworn enemy of The Phantom\nis the \"Vultures\". They have several \"nests\" spread across the world, and as\ntheir name suggests, they prey on the weak and fallen. They will strike the\nhelpless, especially during crisis situations.\n\n## In other media[edit]\n\n### Novels and short stories[edit]\n\nMain article: Phantom novels\n\n#### Whitman[edit]\n\nThe first novel about the Phantom was published in 1944 by Whitman Publishing\nCompany, and was called \"The Son of the Phantom\". Written by Dale Robertson,\nthe book was based on Lee Falk's comic strip story \"Childhood of the Phantom\",\nalthough Falk had no involvement with the novel. It featured a cover drawn by\nWilson McCoy.\n\n#### Avon[edit]\n\nAvon Publications in the United States put out 15 books based on Lee Falk's\nstories. The series ran from 1972 to 1975, and was written by several authors,\nincluding Falk; the covers were done by George Wilson.^[58] Many of the books\nwere translated into foreign languages.\n\n  1.

It was written by Rob MacGregor.^[60]\n\nHermes Press also published a reprint of the Avon novels.^[61]\n\n#### Moonstone Books[edit]\n\nIn 2007, Moonstone Books released The Phantom Chronicles, a collection of\nshort stories written by authors Mike Bullock, Ron Fortier, Jim Alexander,\nDavid Michelinie, Craig Shaw Gardner, CJ Henderson, Clay and Susan Griffith,\nWill Murray, Mike Oliveri, Nancy Kilpatrick, Ed Rhoades, David Bishop, Grant\nSuave, Trina Robbins, Richard Dean Starr, Dan Wickline, and Martin Powell.\n\nThe book was released in both a softcover and limited hardcover edition, and\nfeatured an introduction written by Lee Falk's daughter, Valerie Falk.\n\nThe Phantom Chronicles 2 was released in 2010. It features an unfinished\nstory, written by Harlan Ellison, where the Phantom would have teamed up with\nGreen Hornet, and has a foreword written by Diane Falk.^[62]\n\n#### Other appearances[edit]\n\nIn Umberto Eco's novel, The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, the main\ncharacter describes his childhood experiences of reading The Phantom, as well\nas other comic strip characters like Flash Gordon and Mandrake the Magician.\nThe book also features illustrations of the Phantom, drawn by Ray Moore.\n\nIn Papua New Guinea, the Wahgi people have used images of the Phantom on their\nceremonial war shields, or \"kumbe reipe\". Art historian N.F. Karlins believes\nthat comic books featuring the Phantom may have been brought to Papua New\nGuinea by American troops as early as the 1940s.^[63] The Phantom's popularity\namongst the Wahgi has been attributed to his being a \"man who cannot die\", and\nwho vanquishes his enemies by using his \"strength, intelligence, and fearsome\nreputation\";^[64] Karlins has suggested that, as Wahgi warriors wear masks,\nthe Phantom's own mask may have also been a contributing factor.^[63]\nSimilarly, anthropologist Susan Cochrane has described the Wahgi\ninterpretation of the Phantom as being a \"modern spirit\".^[65]\n\n### Live-action adaptations[edit]\n\n#### The Phantom serials[edit]\n\nMain article: The Phantom (serial)\n\nA 15-episode, 240-minute movie serial, starring Tom Tyler in the title role,\nwas made in 1943 by Columbia Pictures and directed by action specialist B.\nReeves Eason, featuring Jeanne Bates as Diana Palmer, Frank Shannon as her\nuncle Professor Davidson, and Ace the Wonder Dog as Devil. Creator Lee Falk\nwas billed on screen as \"Leon Falk\". The story shows the 21st Phantom's first\nmission after taking over the mantle of the Ghost Who Walks from his murdered\nfather: to find the Lost City of Zoloz and prevent the evil Dr. Bremmer,\nplayed by Kenneth MacDonald, from building a secret airbase in the jungle. The\nserial has been released on DVD through VCI.\n\nThe Phantom's real name in the serial was Geoffrey Prescott, as the alias of\nKit Walker had not been mentioned in the strip at that point.^[66] However, he\ngoes by the alias of Mr. Walker after having become the Phantom.\n\nTwo episodes loosely adapted Lee Falk's story \"The Fire Princess\" for the\nscreen, and fit it into the plot of the Phantom's fight against Dr. Bremmer.\nTom Tyler in costume bore a striking resemblance to the comic-strip character,\nand the serial was a success.^[67]\n\nIn 1955, when Columbia's serial producer Sam Katzman was making low-budget\nremakes of older cliffhangers, he cast John Hart in a sequel, filmed as Return\nof the Phantom.^[66] Hart's new scenes as the Phantom were combined with older\nscenes of Tom Tyler in the identical costume. Katzman failed to check with the\nstudio's legal department, and found that its rights to the Phantom character\nhad lapsed. Katzman, unwilling to meet the rights holder's high price, reshot\nmuch of the action with Hart in a vaguely similar costume (helmet, mask,\nsweater, and riding breeches) to match the old footage with Tom Tyler.\nKatzman, having been forced to delete many of the action scenes from The\nPhantom, filled the gaps with scenes from two more old serials, The Desert\nHawk and Jungle Menace. The new mashup was finally released as The Adventures\nof Captain Africa.^[68]\n\n#### The Phantom (1996)[edit]\n\nMain article: The Phantom (1996 film)\n\nThe Phantom was also adapted into a live-action film in 1996. Produced and\nreleased by Paramount Pictures, the movie was set in the 1930s, and\nincorporated elements from several of the Phantom's earliest comic-strip\nadventures. It starred Billy Zane in the title role, Kristy Swanson as Diana\nPalmer, and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Sala, an aviator. It was directed by Simon\nWincer, after director Joe Dante and producer Michael Douglas dropped out of\nthe project,^[69] and was written by Jeffrey Boam, who also wrote Indiana\nJones and the Last Crusade. Cult-icon Bruce Campbell was another choice for\nthe role,^[70] but Zane, already a huge fan of the comic strip since being\nintroduced to Australian Frew comics on the set of Dead Calm, ended up getting\nthe part after actively lobbying for it for years. After his casting, he\npumped iron for a year and a half to fill the Phantom's costume, refusing to\nwear a costume with moulded muscles. He also closely studied panels of the\ncomic to capture the character's body language. Though the film was not a\ntheatrical success, it was the reason why Zane was cast as Caledon Hockley in\nTitanic, the world's third most commercially successful film,^[71] and has\nsold well on VHS and DVD.^[72]\n\nThe movie was filmed on location in Australia, Thailand, and Los Angeles, and\nfeatured the Phantom in his attempt to stop madman Xander Drax (Treat\nWilliams) from obtaining a weapon of doom, the legendary \"Skulls of Touganda\".\nThe story also features the Singh Brotherhood, the all-female clan of air\npirates known as the Sky Band, of whom Sala is the leader and a subplot\nwherein the 21st Phantom recovers his father's gunbelt and avenges his\nfather's murder, inspired by the Lee Falk/Wilson McCoy story \"The Belt\". The\nfilm also has elements taken from the 1936 story \"The Singh Brotherhood\", the\nfirst Phantom story, and its 1937 continuation \"The Sky Band\".^[73]\n\nIn 2008, syndicated gossip columnist Liz Smith claimed that Paramount was\nputting a sequel into development, with Zane returning to play the title role,\nbecause of the good VHS and DVD sales of the first film.^[74] The Phantom was\nreleased on Blu-ray February 2010 by Lionsgate.^[75]\n\n#### The Phantom: Legacy[edit]\n\nSherlock Symington Productions secured the rights to the Phantom in December\n2008, and were set to make a film called The Phantom: Legacy (unrelated to the\nMoonstone Books 2006 graphic novel of the same name and any other screen\nincarnation of the character). The film was set to have a budget of $130\nmillion, and be written by Tim Boyle.\n\nBruce Sherlock, executive producer and head of Sherlock Symington Productions,\nsaid that The Phantom: Legacy would follow the lead of films like The Dark\nKnight and Iron Man, and present a serious treatment of the character. The\nfilm will be set in the present day, and revolve around the relationship\nbetween the Phantom and his son, and what it means to be the Phantom. Work on\nthe film was expected to begin in 2009. Filming was scheduled to take place in\nAustralia, and producers were in talks with both Australian and international\nactors to work on the film.^[76]\n\nIn an interview with Dark Horizons, Boyle said the film would feature two main\nantagonists, one taken from the comic and one created for the movie. The\nPhantom's costume was expected to be updated for the screen, with Boyle\nseeking to make it more reality-based.^[77] Characters such as Diana Palmer,\nKit, Heloise Walker, Colonel Worubu, President Lamanda Luaga, and Guran would\nappear. The film was said to be heavily focused on the mythology of the\ncomics, with a lot of screen time expected to be devoted to the origin of the\n1st Phantom. The Phantom's eyes behind his mask would be white, unlike in\nprevious film-versions.^[78] Actor Sam Worthington was considered to play the\nPhantom, after having worked with Boyle on the film Fink.\n\nBoyle was originally considered to direct the film, but in 2011 confirmed he\nwas only attached as the writer.^[79]\n\n#### 2014 announcement[edit]\n\nIn 2014 Mark Gordon and his production company were developing a new film with\nManagement 360, Drew Simon was executive producing, and they were looking for\na new writer on the script.^[80]\n\n#### Cameos[edit]\n\nThe Phantom made an appearance alongside other King Features characters in the\n1972 animated movie Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter.^[81] He also\nappeared in the animated Beatles movie Yellow Submarine.^[70]^[82]\n\n#### Unauthorized versions[edit]\n\nAt least three unauthorized Phantom movies were made in Turkey. Two were made\nin 1968 and both were titled K\u0131z\u0131l Maske (the Turkish name for the Phantom,\ntranslated as \"Red Mask\"). The Phantom was played by Ismet Erten^[83] and\nIrfan Atasoy.^[83] The costume worn by Irfan Atasoy bears little resemblance\nto the one seen in the comic strip, but the uniforms worn by Ismet Erten and\nin K\u0131z\u0131l Maske'nin Intikam\u0131 (Revenge of the Red Mask), released in 1971,\nstayed close to the original outfit.^[84]\n\n### Television[edit]\n\nMain articles: The Phantom (1961 film), Phantom 2040, Defenders of the Earth,\nand The Phantom (miniseries)\n\n#### 1961 pilot[edit]\n\nAn unaired color Phantom TV-pilot was made in 1961 starring Roger Creed as the\nPhantom, with Lon Chaney Jr. and Paulette Goddard as the antagonists, and\nRichard Kiel as the assassin \"Big Mike\". Called \"No Escape\", the pilot saw the\nPhantom breaking up a slave camp in the jungle.\n\nMade on a limited budget, the pilot features fight scenes and the Phantom\nterrorizing villains in the jungle. Writer John Carr originally wrote four\nepisodes, but because the pilot was not picked up by a network, the remaining\nthree were never filmed. Actress Marilyn Manning had originally been cast as\nDiana Palmer, but never appeared in the pilot.^[85] Devil, Hero, and the\nJungle Patrol all appear throughout the course of the story.\n\nThe pilot was shown at the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in 2008 and has\nalso been shown at Comic Con in San Diego.^[86]\n\n#### Defenders of the Earth[edit]\n\nIn Defenders of the Earth, which ran from 1986 to 1987, the 27th Phantom,^[87]\nvoiced by actor Peter Mark Richman, teams up with fellow King Features\nadventurers Flash Gordon, Mandrake the Magician, and Mandrake's bodyguard and\nassistant Lothar. The cartoon also featured a daughter, Jedda Walker, who\nbriefly took on the Phantom mantle in an episode where she believed her father\nto have perished.^[88]\n\nOther episodes of the series featured classic Phantom villains like the Sky\nBand, the Phantom's evil older brother Kurt Walker (created specifically for\nthe show), and a flashback to the days of the first Phantom. The episode\n\"Return of the Sky Band\" also featured lengthy flashbacks to the Phantom of\nLee Falk's comic strip, the 21st Phantom, showing him and his wife, Diana\nPalmer, and their encounter with the original Sky Band.\n\nIn the original presentation pilot for the series, the Phantom had a son, Kit\nWalker, and Flash Gordon had a daughter, but this was changed for the final\nseries.^[89]\n\nIn Defenders of the Earth, the Phantom was able to use supernatural means to\ngive himself increased strength and speed, by saying the incantation:\n\n\"By jungle law, the ghost who walks calls forth the power of ten tigers!\"\n\nIt is only in this cartoon series that the Phantom has such an ability. In the\nseries, the Phantom also used a special helicopter nicknamed the Skull Copter,\nand had an updated Skull Ring that would shoot a laser on to the faces of\nantagonists, marking them for life.^[89]\n\nThe complete series has been released on DVD in several editions, the latest\nin 2010.^[90]\n\n#### Phantom 2040[edit]\n\nPremiering in 1994 to widespread critical acclaim,^[91] Phantom 2040 depicts\nthe adventures of the 24th Phantom on a future Earth rife with pollution and\nheavy industrialization. Young Kit Walker, was living happily with his aunt\nHeloise (daughter of the 21st Phantom) in the city of Metropia (previously\nknown as New York^[92]) in the year 2040, knowing nothing about his family's\nlegacy, when one day, The Phantom's friend Guran turned up to reveal the\nsecret of the Phantom legacy. Kit takes up the mantle of the Phantom, and\nstarts a battle against the evil company Maximum Inc., and their plans for the\n\"Maximum Era\" (a horrific plan for world domination through mass extinction by\nthe complete collapse of Earth's ecosystem). He also tries to solve the\nmystery of the death of his father, the 23rd Phantom.\n\nThis animated series, created by David J. Corbett and Judith and Garfield\nReeves-Stevens, lasted two seasons (35 episodes) and spawned a number of\nmerchandise tie-ins, a comic book series, and a video game. The show's ahead-\nof-its time voice casting and vocal direction by Stuart M. Rosen had a lasting\nimpact on animated adventure television, introducing (alongside Andrea\nRomano's acclaimed work on Batman: The Animated Series) a new level of\nmaturity and complexity to animated vocal performance that set the standard\nfor all TV animation that followed.\n\nThe Phantom was voiced by actor Scott Valentine and J.D.Hall played The\nPhantom's mentor Guran. Margot Kidder voiced main antagonist Rebecca Madison\nwhile Jeff Bennett played her sociopathic son Max Madison Jr. Ron Perlman\n(and, later, Richard Lynch) played tortured cyborg Graft, Debbie Harry played\nVaingloria, and Mark Hamill lent his voice to the character of Dr. Jak.^[93]\n\nThe first four episodes of the series were edited into a feature-length film\nand released on VHS in 1994 and 1996 (and later on DVD in 2004), called\nPhantom 2040: The Ghost Who Walks. Other episodes of the series were released\non VHS in 1995. Season One (containing the first 20 episodes of the show) was\nreleased on DVD in Australia in 2013.\n\n#### Betaal Pachisi[edit]\n\nA series aired on Doordarshan in 1997 named Betaal Pachisi depicting the 25th\nPhantom played by Shahbaz Khan. He is shown fighting poachers and supernatural\nentities. Krutika Desai Khan plays Naina Jogan, the jungle spirit in love with\nBetaal (the Phantom). Sonu Walia plays a TV reporter who becomes his love\ninterest.\n\n#### The Phantom (Syfy)[edit]\n\nScreenwriter Daniel Knauf and his son and collaborator Charles Knauf completed\na four-hour TV-movie script for Sci Fi Channel, later renamed Syfy, starring\nthe 22nd Phantom.^[94] The mini-series, simply called The Phantom, and was\nproduced by Muse Entertainment and RHI Entertainment. It premiered in Canada\non The Movie Network in December 2009, as a two-part mini-series, a total of\nthree hours.\n\nRyan Carnes stars as the Phantom, with Paolo Barzman directing. The series was\nshot in New York City, Costa Rica and Montreal.^[95]\n\nThe story sees law student Kit learning that he was adopted, and that he is\nactually the son of the 21st Phantom and Diana Palmer Walker. He joins the\nPhantom team in the jungles of Bengalla (in this version, Bengalla is a small\nisland in Indonesia), and is trained in martial arts and combat, emerging as\nthe next Phantom to battle the Singh Brotherhood and save the only man who can\nbring peace to the Middle East.^[96] The 22nd Phantom wears a modified costume\nthat is highly resistant to bullets, blades and falls, doubles his strength\nand can make him move faster.^[97]\n\nThe mini-series aired on Syfy in June 2010, and was released on Blu-ray and\nDVD by Vivendi Entertainment.^[98]\n\n#### Parodies[edit]\n\nPaul Hogan, of Crocodile Dundee fame, continually parodied the Phantom on his\nAustralian TV-show, The Paul Hogan Show.^[99] He would dress up in the purple\nPhantom costume, and act out different humorous situations. The Phantom had\nalso been frequently parodied on Scandinavian television, in different humor\nprograms.\n\nIn 1984, Australian stand-up comedian Austen Tayshus released a single Phantom\nShuffle^[100] in the video of which he appeared in Phantom costume, wearing\nsunglasses instead of a mask. Many elements of the Phantom myth were parodied,\nsuch as him being \"Mr Walker, the man who cannot drive\".\n\nIn 2017, Australian comedian Sammy J began touring with a new show, Hero\nComplex, in which he pays tribute to what he says is the role the Phantom has\nplayed in his life: \"a chance encounter set off a chain of events that led to\nme meeting my wife and ended with police searching my attic\".^[101] Hero\nComplex has won a \"Best Comedy\" award or nomination in every festival in which\nit has featured.\n\nIn the Adult Swim show The Venture Bros., the character The Phantom Limb bears\na strong visual resemblance to the Phantom, right down to the same purple suit\nand mask, except that the Phantom Limb's limbs are invisible, making him look\nlike a floating torso. However, The Phantom Limb is a villainous character.\n\nThe myth surrounding the Phantom also provided Turkish humorists with a lot of\nmaterial. The humor magazine Leman has published many comic strips some of\nwhich were inspired by the (imaginary) saying \"in the jungle, it is rumored\nthat the Phantom has the strength of ten tigers\" where Phantom runs into\ntrouble with 11 or more tigers.\n\nThe Phantom was parodied in a 2007 episode of Robot Chicken titled \"Werewolf\nvs. Unicorn\", where he appeared alongside Flash Gordon and Mandrake the\nMagician. He was voiced by Frank Welker.^[102]\n\nThe Phantom was a frequently appearing character in the Finnish comic strip\nFingerpori by Pertti Jarla. He was often involved in humorous situations such\nas using his throne as a toilet seat.\n\n#### Documentaries[edit]\n\nIn 1996, the A&E Network created a documentary about the history of the\nPhantom for television, called The Phantom: Comic Strip Crusader. Narrated by\nPeter Graves, it featured interviews with creator Lee Falk, actors Billy Zane\nand Kristy Swanson, director Simon Wincer, Frew-editor Jim Shepherd, George\nOlesen, Keith Williams, and president of the US Phantom fan club Friends of\nthe Phantom, Ed Rhoades. The documentary was released on DVD in 2006.\n\nTo promote the 1996 Paramount Phantom movie, an HBO special called \"Making of\nThe Phantom\" was made. It featured behind-the-scenes information on the movie\nand the comic.\n\nAn original documentary presentation called History of the Phantom was shown\nat the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in September 2008.\n\n#### MythBusters \"Superhero Hour\"[edit]\n\nOn MythBusters season 5, episode 17 \"Superhero Hour\", it was tested whether\nthe Phantom's skull ring would make an imprint on someone when you punch them\nwhile wearing it, as it did in the comic. The result was that the myth was\n\"busted\", in that hitting a person in the face hard enough to leave a ring\nimprint on the skin required more than enough force to crush a human\nskull.^[103]\n\nIn The Last Phantom comic, it had been revealed that the Phantom's ring\nactually had sharp edges and was covered with a permanent ink synthesized from\nplants found in the depths of the Bengallan jungle, leaving a permanent scar-\nlike mark. It was, in effect, an instant tattoo.\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\nSee also: Phantom 2040 (video game)\n\nThe Phantom has appeared as a playable character in two video games, Phantom\n2040 and Defenders of the Earth. Both were based on the animated series with\nthe same titles. However, in Defenders of the Earth, the Phantom was not the\nonly playable character, as players were given the choice to control Mandrake\nthe Magician and Flash Gordon as well.\n\nIn Phantom 2040, released on Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Super NES, the\nPhantom was the only playable character. He had use of a number of his special\nskills and high-tech gadgets from the Phantom 2040 TV-series. The game had a\ncomplex storyline and featured several different endings, which were dependent\non the choices the player made during the game.\n\nIn 2003, a video game made for Game Boy Advance was announced, called \"The\nPhantom: The Ghost Who Walks\". It was developed by 7th Sense and produced by\nMicroids, and it was described as a free-roaming jungle adventure.^[104]\nDuring the development process, Microids went bankrupt, and the game was never\nreleased.\n\nIn 2006, The Phantom Mobile Game became available for cellphones, where the\nPhantom fought zombies, floating skulls, and other magical creatures to find\nhis kidnapped wife, Diana Palmer. It was described as a free-roaming jungle\nadventure, with a film-like plot.^[105]\n\n### Theme park[edit]\n\n\"Fantomenland\" (\"Phantom Land\") was a part of the Swedish zoo Parken Zoo,\nEskilstuna, where audiences could visit the Skull Cave, and several other\nplaces from the comic, like the Whispering Grove and the headquarters of the\nJungle Patrol. Visitors could also meet actors dressed up as the Phantom and\nwitness short plays featuring the characters of the comic.^[106] Fantomenland\nwas inaugurated by Lee Falk in 1986. Fantomenland closed in April 2010.^[107]\n\n### Fine art[edit]\n\nA gallery in Brisbane, Australia, ran an exhibit of Phantom-inspired artwork\nin 1973. Australian Galleries ran an exhibit, \"The Phantom Show\", consisting\nof traditional art inspired by the Phantom, from December 9\u201321,\n2014.^[108]^[109] Curated by Peter Kingston, \"The Phantom Show\" opened in\nSydney in 2014 and travelled across Australia, stopping in Wollongong, Mackay,\nToowoomba and Broken Hill.^[110] Contributing artists, all fans of The\nPhantom, sought to revive the spirit of Ray Moore and Wilsom McCoy's work on\nthe original comic strip before, as Kingston put it, \"The Phantom became a\nslick, purple superhero\".^[110]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n  1. ^ Romance and the Vesta Pirates, Frew, edition 4, December 1948, also as a daily newspaper strip in American newspapers from the 31st of March 1947 through till the 29th of November 1947\n  2. ^ \"The Phantom\".
