For my subscribers\nusing screenreaders and others who love audio: I\u2019ve got a voiced version of\nthis post just below this paragraph \u2014 let me know if your software is not able\nto locate it. And the alt text edit function isn\u2019t working, so I\u2019ve got image\ndescriptions in audio and in the captions this time.\n\n1\u00d7\n\n0:00\n\n-13:17\n\nFaro caf\u00e9, in Harvard Square, gets its name from the Spanish word for\n\u201clighthouse,\u201d and it\u2019s got a no-laptops policy that is gently, but strictly,\nenforced.\n\nThe big windows that line Faro\u2019s facade beckon with warm light and greenery.\nImage via.\n\nYou can look at your phone. You can use a little gaming tablet. But they\u2019ve\noutlawed laptops \u2014 upright and rectangular cognitive anchors that suck all\nenergy toward themselves. Multiplied across a room, laptops erect an office\nwhere a caf\u00e9 had been. And Faro is trying to keep the office at bay.\n\nBut the office-style caf\u00e9 is really great, you say. It is! You can go a few\ndoors down in a couple directions and find some good ones. But Faro has their\nlittle manifesto printed and hung on one wall \u2014 unobtrusive, easy to miss \u2014\nand they just want something else happening in the space.\n\nI sent my architecture students to Faro and two other nearby sites this spring\n\u2014 a scavenger hunt to find some of the \u201climiting virtues\u201d embedded in\nbuildings. I got inspired by David McPherson\u2019s The Virtues of Limits, where he\nlays out humility, reverence, moderation, contentment, neighborliness, and\nloyalty as virtues that constrain us in order to set us free.\n\nAll these virtues are laudable, surely, but not exactly high on the\naspirational list in a culture more enamored of the active virtues, like\ncourage and magnanimity. I wanted students to see where a built space takes\naway some freedoms \u2014 enforcing the moderation and contentment that mitigates\nall-screens-all-the-time, for example \u2014 and thereby opens up other freedoms. A\nno-laptops policy means you can\u2019t get a certain kind of work done, but it does\nmean everyone present will be a little more eyes-up-and-talking, or maybe\nabsorbed by a book or notebook. The activities will be at the speed of the\nbody, one to another. Is it nostalgic and precious? Maybe. But it\u2019s not the\nonly caf\u00e9 in town to make this move, and I think there\u2019s some signal there.\nFaro started out with no-laptops only on weekends, and the policy was welcome\nenough to make it a daily norm. Over at Zuzu\u2019s Petals, it\u2019s no devices of any\nkind.\n\nThe soaring heights of stone, arches, and columns at St Paul\u2019s. Image via.\n\nAcross the street from Faro is St. Paul\u2019s Parish, where you can come exactly\nas you are, but reverence is always encouraged \u2014 including in the weekday noon\nmasses sung by a boys\u2019 choir, complete with Elizabethan collars. (St. Paul\u2019s\nhas one of the only choir schools in the United States!) Sacred spaces aren\u2019t\na popular subject in architecture schools except as antiquarian study, I find.\nI suggested students visit either this great cavernous space in the middle of\nthe bustling university square or the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center\nnearby, with its beautifully pared-down top floor of a grand old Victorian\nhouse. I could also have suggested a visit to the nearby monks\u2019 dwelling at\nthe Society of Saint John the Evangelist, whose exquisite stone chapel often\nfeatures a sandwich board out front, enticing passersby not with lunch deals\nor storewide discounts but that rarest (limiting) thing: silence.\n\nAnd speaking of silence, their last stop was the main branch of the Cambridge\nPublic Library, especially its contemporary addition to the 19th century\noriginal.\n\nThe 19th century neo-Romanesque structure of the original library conjoined to\nits modern steel and glass addition, with a big sunny expanse of lawn and\ntrees out front. Image via.\n\nThe library holds a gradation of the limiting virtues: a half-quiet first\nfloor with new books, tables and chairs for afterschool tutoring, and the\ninformation desks for everyone \u2014 the neighborliness of a public institution\u2019s\nfront door. The second floor features enclosed meeting spaces for groups on a\nfirst-come, first-serve basis, plus a really really quiet room for patrons\nwanting the moderation of all notifications off. The entire third floor is\ndevoted to children \u2014 a beautiful raucous energy, with activity rooms, cozy\nnooks, and floor-to-ceiling windows on every side. A teen room in the old\nstructure holds high-backed wing chairs and booths for semi-sedentary\nsocializing, and a maker space occupies much of the basement. Things you can\ndo and things you can\u2019t, by design.\n\nThe sunny first floor of the library features desktop monitors for research,\ntables and chairs, and rows of new books, in contemporary blond wood. Image\nvia.\n\nMcPherson writes that the limiting virtues are grounded in the dispositional\nsubstrate of an \u201caccepting-appreciating\u201d stance toward the world, as opposed\nto the \u201cchoosing-controlling\u201d stance that is the naturalized, invisible, and\ntotalizing definition of 21st century technocratic freedom. No one wants life\nwithout choices, of course. But McPherson writes that the limiting virtue of\nloyalty \u2014 especially \u201cloyalty to the given world\u201d \u2014 is one way to cultivate\nthis accepting-appreciating posture and to enjoy the freedom that it brings.\n\nShare\n\nWhat\u2019s the opposite of loyalty to the given world? Maybe it\u2019s what Tyler\nAustin Harper calls \u201ctherapeutic libertarianism\u201d:\n\n> the belief that self-improvement is the ultimate goal of life, and that no\n> formal or informal constraints \u2014 whether imposed by states, faith systems,\n> or other people \u2014should impede each of us from achieving personal growth.\n> This attitude is therapeutic because it is invariably couched in self-help\n> babble. And it is libertarian not only because it makes a cult out of\n> personal freedom, but because it applies market logic to human beings. We\n> are all our own start-ups. We must all adopt a pro-growth mindset for our\n> personhood and deregulate our desires. We must all assess and reassess our\n> own \u201cfulfillment,\u201d a kind of psychological Gross Domestic Product, on a\n> near-constant basis. And like the GDP, our fulfillment must always increase.\n\nHarper, reviewing Molly Roden Winter\u2019s More: A Memoir of an Open Marriage,\nfinds its account of polyamory not a breathless liberation but an anguished\nslog of misery, led by endless choices. Some philosophers would call this\n\u201cradical autonomy\u201d \u2014 the idea that a choice is automatically good just for\nhaving been chosen. Harper is skewering the particular alloy of individualism\nand therapy-speak among the cosseted classes:\n\n> In this way, More is a near-perfect time capsule of the banal pleasure-\n> seeking of wealthy, elite culture in the 2020s, and a neat encapsulation of\n> its flaws. This culture would have us believe that interminable self-\n> improvement projects, navel-gazing, and sexual peccadilloes are the new face\n> of progress. The climate warms, wars rage, and our country lurches toward a\n> perilous election\u2014all problems that require real action, real progress. And\n> somehow \u201cyou do you\u201d has become the American ruling class\u2019s three-word\n> bible.\n>\n> The philosopher Charles Taylor has argued that, since at least the late 20th\n> century, Western societies have been defined by \u201ca generalized culture of\n> \u2018authenticity,\u2019 or expressive individualism, in which people are encouraged\n> to find their own way, discover their own fulfillment, \u2018do their own\n> thing.\u2019\u201d Taylor describes a phenomenon that\u2019s all too easy to recognize in\n> today\u2019s pop psychology and the maundering of wellness influencers, but his\n> concept doesn\u2019t quite capture the extent to which this relentless quest for\n> self-optimizing authenticity has infused our social and even political\n> sensibilities.\n\nI want architecture students to see that the flexible, modular, all-purpose\nand all-choices box of a room isn\u2019t always what\u2019s called for. It sounds right\n\u2014 surely your client wants a space that could be anything you need it to be \u2014\nbut unprogrammed space is often tractionless, characterless. A city should\ncontain a whole panoply of richly imagined and specific spaces, containers\nbuilt with interior features for freedoms and limits alike. McPherson calls us\nto a life with \u201cenhanced autonomy\u201d\u2014 a life with choices that are also informed\nby our loyalty to the given, unchosen world \u2014 what we might just call living\nwith obligations. I\u2019d like to see designers take a renewed look at limits in\ntheir partnership for civic goods: rules that constrain and liberate.\n\nThanks for reading. I\u2019ve been quiet here because I made a 22-minute\ndocumentary film, start to finish, between January and this week \u2014 a\npartnership with my husband and co-producer, Brian Funck, who is a genius.\nIt\u2019ll premiere at the Design for All? show at Museum f\u00fcr Gestaltung Z\u00fcrich\nthis summer and afterward in an online channel near you, I hope! Stay tuned.\nI\u2019ve got the short film bug for sure; at least two others, also in dialogue\nwith scientific ideas, are in the hopper.\n\nI\u2019m finishing up my first year at Northeastern and headed to my studio for the\nlong summer soon. Got a new book idea and some painting-sculpture hybrids in\nthe works.\n\nThings I loved the last few months: Seeing Martina Majok\u2019s Cost of Living.\nReading the first two Earthsea books with my youngest, who just turned 14.\nIntroducing my students to Penny Lane\u2019s The Voyagers. Discovering Sir John\nTavener\u2019s Funeral Canticle. Wendell Berry\u2019s Jayber Crow and Jordan Castro\u2019s\nThe Novelist. A class trip to the Arnold Arboretum to talk with Matthew\nBattles about the riotous life and history of trees, and reading aloud in\nclass his stunningly beautiful editor\u2019s note for Arnoldia: \u201cBalm for a World\nof Wounds.\u201d\n\nShare\n\n60 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n12 Restacks\n\n60\n\nShare this post\n\n#### the city and the limiting virtues\n\nsarahendren.substack.com\n\n6\n\nShare\n\n6 Comments\n\nKaren MorrisApr 7Liked by Sara HendrenSuch fascinating thoughts.

I think about\nthis a lot in the emotional world: a commitment to a relationship, or work,\ntakes away some freedoms and leads you deeper. Interesting that it operates in\nthe physical realm, too.
