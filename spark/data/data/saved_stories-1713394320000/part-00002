You can explore it. And then die, when\nsomeone in your party remembers a tragic incident involving meat and perishes\nof sadness.\n\nBay 12 Games/Kitfox\n\n#### reader comments\n\n14\n\n\"I'm crying for some reason,\" says Tarn Adams, demonstrating Dwarf Fortress'\n\"Adventure Mode\" for a Discord stream full of games writers and PR folk. His\nadventurer is crying, that is. \"Something must have upset me. Probably the\ndead bodies... I have great grouchiness, though.\"\n\nAdventure Mode, out today, builds on the graphical version of Dwarf Fortress\nand the work you've put into it. The adventurers you create and send out into\nthe world traverse the overland and underground places you yourself crafted.\nThis allows you to both appreciate the realms carved out by your imagination\nand also be a kind of dungeon master for other adventurers (with, hopefully,\nan easier fortress-swapping mechanic to come soon). You can also generate a\nnew world if you prefer the simulation's weird choices to your own.\n\nRelease trailer for Dwarf Fortress' Adventure Mode update.\n\nEverything about the standard simulation version of playing Dwarf Fortress\napplies to playing it as a hardcore CRPG. Everything has layers, all is\ndescribed, and the combination of deep logic and utter silliness is unmatched.\n\nTarn Adams and his brother, Zach Adams, creators of Dwarf Fortress, noted some\nof the games' differences from traditional role-playing games in their\ndemonstration. The people you encounter aren't put there by narrative-minded\ndesigners, eager to guide you onward in your quest. They only know what they\nare capable of knowing, as determined by the simulation. You can ask about the\ntemple you've been tasked with clearing out, and they might just say they have\nno idea. This kind of cold calculus changes with difficulty level, but don't\nexpect everyone you meet to be a font of useful exposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * You get far more origin options, especially of the hybrid animal/human kind, in Adventure Mode. Look out world, here comes Louse man.\n\nBay 12 Games/Kitfox\n\n  * As with the base game, the inventory in Adventure Mode is detailed. You get the item, the material, the origin, condition, and, of course, keyboard shortcuts.\n\nBay 12 Games/Kitfox\n\n  * Combat is turn-based, unlike the base game, so you can absorb everything that's happening. \"This is a fight! I feel no terror,\" says the slim goblin lasher.\n\nBay 12 Games/Kitfox\n\n  * You can see all the conditions of chats you have with people in a fortress. It's nice to see a Human Swordsman with a neutral attitude toward a goblin.\n\nBay 12 Games/Kitfox\n\n  * \"He dreams of bathing the world in chaos,\" but \"he has no ambition whatsoever.\" At least he is \"very slow to anger.\" He's a complicated dwarf, and nobody understands him but his party boss.\n\nBay 12 Games/Kitfox\n\nPrevious SlideNext Slide\n\nThe same goes for combat, which is just as brutal as in the core game. Tarn\ntook on a bear in his demo, the hard way. \"Let's put away our weapon. Let's\nwrestle with the bear. You gotta wrestle with the bear, right?\" he said. Tarn\ngripped the bear's leg, but the bear, being a bear, easily broke free. A\ncompanion with a crossbow then aimed for the bear's neck and hit true, and the\nbear started vomiting. \"Let's see if he's paralyzed... 'Cannot breathe,\nsensory nerve damage.' Okay,\" he said.\n\nThere is a long list of all the conditions that affect the bear, including the\nfact that it cannot feel things in its lower half. When they looted the body,\nthe party got back the iron bolt stuck in its neck but also discover another\niron bolt, seemingly from a previous encounter with adventurers. As with\nstandard \"Fortress Mode,\" the game happens before you play\u2014and after you play.\nAdventure Mode puts you into your maps two weeks after the ruination of your\nfortress; there's a real sense of impermanence to everything, which is\nprobably good, considering your chances of getting out alive.\n\nAdventure Mode is out in beta today. You can activate it by choosing the beta\nbranch of the game while in Steam. (I'll update this post when I see how to\ndive into the beta for Itch.io copies).\n\n### Ars Video\n\n#### reader comments\n\n14\n\nKevin Purdy Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering a\nvariety of technology topics and reviewing products.
