The turnout \u2014 around 300 people at GMU back when it was clearly a\ncommuter school \u2014 surprised me and totally shocked Larry. I still remember his\neyes bugging out when he entered the auditorium! Though perhaps he was just\nastounded to see me wearing a suit.\n\nWe tried recording using an early-gen iPod, but that failed. All that remains\nof the debate is the following opening statement and this supplementary\nwebpage, though I\u2019d obviously be happy to run any response Larry cared to\nwrite. Enjoy!\n\nLarry Iannaccone and his co-author Rodney Stark once wrote that the belief\nthat society is getting less religious says \"less about empirical fact than it\ndoes about secularization faith \u2014 a faith that, despite a mountain of evidence\nto the contrary, sustains the conviction of many social scientists that\nreligious institutions must soon decay...\" In short, belief in secularization\nis just a religion.\n\nLarry's critics were, unsurprisingly, not pleased. To tell people that their\nnon-religious beliefs are just a religion is an insult. Why is it an insult?\nThere isn't any nice way to answer, so I'll be blunt. It is an insult because\nthe way that people form religious beliefs is so intellectually irresponsible\nthat their conclusions are almost guaranteed to be false. People:\n\n  * accept their religious beliefs with little or no evidence\n\n  * accept religious beliefs that are contrary to the evidence\n\n  * accept religious beliefs without studying competing views\n\n  * are certain about religious beliefs that are dubious at best, and\n\n  * accept their religious beliefs not because they are intellectually compelling, but because they are emotionally comforting.\n\nForming non-religious beliefs in a religious way is irrational because forming\nany beliefs in a religious way is irrational.\n\nNow I am not one of those people who says that modern science has disproven\nreligion. If I said that, it would imply that two thousand years ago, there\nwas not solid evidence against the claims that Jesus was born of a virgin and\nrose from the dead. But the counter-evidence has always been overwhelming.\nEveryone else is born of a non-virgin and stays dead. It is absurd to\nrecognize an exception without overwhelming evidence, but all we have is the\ntestimony of a few of his disciples. And yet not only do Christians believe\nthese things; they often claim to know them with certainty, and get angry if\nyou disagree. Christianity has always been irrational, and of course the same\ngoes for Judaism, Islam, Greek mythology, Satanism, and belief in Santa Claus.\n\nLarry has won a great deal of attention for his rational choice theory of\nreligion. But if you look closely, he doesn't really have a rational choice\ntheory of religion; he has a rational choice theory of group membership. As\nLarry occasionally admits, virtually everything that he says about religion\napplies just as well to fraternities, chess clubs, and football teams. Yes,\nbelonging to a fraternity has costs and benefits; yes, competition between\nfraternities leads to more efficient outcomes. And both religions and\nfraternities have been known to use what Larry calls \"bizarre\" rules \u2014 such as\n\"You can't drink any alcohol,\" or \"You can only drink alcohol,\" to exclude\nhalf-hearted members.\n\nWhat Larry's research strangely neglects \u2013 or, to use his word, \"sidesteps\" -\nis the differences between religions and fraternities. The most obvious of\nthese, the 800-pound gorilla in the room, is doctrine. Fraternities don't have\nmuch of a doctrine; religions do. To ignore doctrine is to ignore the very\nthing that makes religion special \u2014 and the main reason why critics of\nreligion consider it irrational. Furthermore, to ignore doctrine is to\nsidestep the deepest objection to Larry's rational choice view of religion:\nHow can you have a rational choice theory of irrational belief?\n\nLarry's neglect of irrational beliefs is glaring because in the last decade\neconomists have started to take irrationality seriously. Behavioral economists\nemphasize, for example, that people overestimate the riskiness of air travel\nbecause plane crashes are vivid and memorable. But if that's irrational, how\nmuch more irrational is it to believe that someone rose from the dead because\none old book says so? Economists who study religion know enough about\nirrationality to send Kahneman, Tversky, and Thaler back to the minors. But \u2014\npresumably out of respect for religion \u2014 they refuse to swing their bats.\n\nWhat would economists learn if they started paying attention to the doctrinal\nside of religion? Now is my time for shameless self-promotion. In a series of\npapers on what I call \"rational irrationality,\" I try to handle the deep\nobjection that Larry sidesteps. I defend a rational choice theory of\nirrational belief. The gist of my theory is that people persistently hold\nwildly irrational religious beliefs because the material cost is usually very\nlow. In terms of daily life, what difference does it make if the earth is 6000\nyears old or 6 billion? So it's not surprising how readily people shut their\neyes to the geological evidence. In contrast, when the cost of irrationality\nis high, believers conveniently forget the teachings of their religion. Lots\nof religions promise paradise to martyrs, but adherents eager to die for their\nbeliefs are one-in-a-million.\n\nIs religion rational? In an important sense, NO. The doctrines of every\nreligion are at best extremely improbable, but adherents are still very\ncertain about them. Religious beliefs and standard economic models don't fit\ntogether. However, rather than ignoring or denying this incompatibility,\neconomists should deal with it. If I'm right, it's not hard. Yes, religious\nbeliefs are irrational, but they are so divorced from reality that they are\nrarely costly. When they do become costly, a few fanatics lay down their\nlives, but the overwhelming majority of the faithful open their eyes and face\nthe fact that it's crazy to bet your life on fairy tales.\n\n### Subscribe to Bet On It\n\nBy Bryan Caplan \u00b7 Hundreds of paid subscribers\n\nCaplan and Candor\n\n19 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n19\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Why Religious Beliefs Are Irrational, and Why Economists Should Care\n\nwww.betonit.ai\n\n19\n\nShare\n\n19 Comments\n\nDon Salmon3 hrs agoIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more irrational, utterly non-\nempirical (sorry, anti-empirical) faith than scientism:1\\. Out of utter\nnothingness, stuff happened (or to put it more crudely, as the foundational\ncatechism of this supernaturalist religion, \u201csh*t happens). Out of pure chaos,\norder arises. As Richard Dawkins put it, in a purely chance based random\noccurrence, order happens.Ok, so maybe 1 in a quadrillion changes against it,\nsomething orderly occurs.AND IT KEEPS OCCURING. What keeps it in place?\u201cThe\nlaws of nature.\u201dWhat do you mean, \u2018laws of nature?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s the phrase we\nuse to describe the orderly occurrences, and in particular, our mathematical\nmeasurements, of the orderly occurrences that we observe.\u201dCan you say\n\u201ctautology?\u201dOk, so these end up with all these brilliantly lit stars and red\nsuns and all that?Oh no, there\u2019s no light or color anywhere, that\u2019s just a\nconstruction of our brains?And how do these brains end up creating this\nexperience of light and color and sound and so on?Well, according to\nphilosopher of mind Jerry Fodor, not only do we not have any idea how purely\nmaterial brains create experience, we don\u2019t have any idea how to have an idea\non how purely material brains create experience......\u201dSo much for the\nphilosophy of mind,\u201d he concludes.Ok, let\u2019s go on. Nowadays, despite the\nalleged overcoming of the \u201celan vital\u201d some time around 1840, there seems to\nbe increasing agreement that we can\u2019t explain life in purely material terms.Oh\nno, we have that covered.Really/. You can explain how life\nemerges?Absolutely.Well, how?Through emergence.I\u2019m sorry, what?Yes, we have a\nwonderful theory. It even covers the laws of nature. How did they emerge? By\nmeans of a complex set of equations related to complexity and chaos theory. It\nexplains everything:Order emerges from nothingnessLife emergesSentience\nemergesEmotion emergesRationality emergesSelf awareness emerges.Ok, so things\nemerge by means of emergence. I\u2019m not sure how different that is from the\nCatholic catechism where we celebrate Christ bringing all things into being;\nwell, no, Christ, rather than being a \u201cbelief\u201d (philosophers nowadays seem to\nthink even the mystics were like early versions of Ryle, trying to come up\nwith rational analyses of how the world works), was referring to an\nexperience; well actually, referring to a particular gnostic apprehension of\nthe cosmos which does not seem even remotely accessible to modern\nphilosophers.But anyway, it seems that one of the areas where religions and\nscience might meet is in your vaunted science of parapsychology. I understand\nas long as 15 or possibly 25 years ago, the psi researchers had conducted a\nsufficient number of experiments - well over 1000 - that met all the criteria\nthat skeptics had been asking for since the late 1800s.Scientist/\u201cphilosopher\u201d\n- yes that\u2019s true. By 1996, every request we had EVER made was met. Perfect\nmethodology, statistics, replication, effect size, etc. That could have been a\ngood meeting place. Except for one thing.Sane person: \u201coh, really, what is\nthat?\u201dScientist philosopher: we were never even remotely sincere about our\nrequests. We have been terrified of psi since scientists started offering\nvalid proof for it back in the late 1800s. WE were absolutely committed, much\nlike the most extreme fundamentalists, to the creed that psi is impossible (it\nviolates the laws of nature!). So we simply changed tactics. Experiments\nconducted in the last 25 years continue to be as good or better than those in\nmost areas of physics, biology, etc. So we just say, \u201cWe don\u2019t care if you\u2019ve\nmet all the criteria we set out. We have new ones. You have to do BETTER than\nany other science.\u201d And if they do, we\u2019ll just find a new excuse. And in fact,\none of the high priests of scientism has one. Arthur Reber, in a response to\nan American Psychological Association article summarizing decades of valid psi\nresearch, replied, in essence, \u201cI didn\u2019t even bother to read the article\u201d\n(yep, the APA actually published this). \u201cI don\u2019t have to because we know psi\nviolates the laws of nature. Therefore ANY scientific experiment of any kind,\nno matter how large the effect size, no matter how often it\u2019s replicated, has\nto be wrong.\u201d****If you think about it, if you resort strictly to the third\nperson method of most science, you wouldn\u2019t even have evidence that the\nunvierse as we experience it exists. A psychiatrist once said to Huston Smith,\nthe writer on world religions, that from a strict DSM point of view, scientism\nwould qualify as a delusional disorder.And that\u2019s an insult to people with\ndelusional disorders!Expand full commentLike (5)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \n4 replies\n\nEric2 hrs ago\u00b7edited 1 hr agoIt is actually very rational.1\\.
