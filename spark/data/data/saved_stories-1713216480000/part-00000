I understand why people are upset and I\u2019m truly sorry.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Guardian, the brand sent cease-and-desist letters to\ncompanies using the term \u201cchili crunch\u201d and \u201cchile crunch\u201d and was hoping to\nsuccessfully trademark the former.\n\n\u201cWhen we created our product, we wanted a name we could own and intentionally\npicked \u2018Chili Crunch\u2019 to further differentiate it from the broader chili crisp\ncategory,\u201d a spokesperson for Momofuku and Chang told TODAY.com. The company\nsaid it hopes to resolve branding disputes amicably.\n\nChang, in his podcast, explained the backstory behind Momofuku\u2019s chili crunch,\nciting the brand Lao Gan Ma, known for its spicy chili crisp sauce, as one of\nthe original inspirations for the product, in addition to other sauces\nincluding ssamjang and salsa macha.\n\n\u201cWhen we were thinking about naming \u2014 and again, shame on me if I didn\u2019t know\nthis \u2014 but we named it chili crunch specifically because it was not chili\ncrisp,\u201d Chang explained. \u201cAnd we named it chili crunch because it was out of\ndeference to chili crisp, which we associated with as Chinese, specifically\ncarved out by Lao Gan Ma.\u201d\n\nThe name behind the popular product was intentional, with Chang explaining\nthat the product wasn\u2019t \u201cchili crisp,\u201d but rather the texture \u201cwas crunchy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad I known, or Momofuku known, that chili crunch was a tautology, basically\nthe same as chili crisp, we would have never named it chili crunch,\u201d he said.\n\nChang and Mariscal explained that when the brand launched its chili crunch\nproduct, it received a cease-and-desist letter from the Colorado based company\nChile Colonial. However, rather than changing the name of its product,\nMarsical said that Momofuku worked with the company to purchase the trademark\nand gave the brand \u201ca perpetual license to continue to use the name.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we acquired this mark, it then became our job to protect it,\u201d Mariscal\nexplained. \u201cThe reason we received a cease-and-desist from Chile Colonial is\nthe same exact reason that Momofuku was sending them out, which is if you\ndon\u2019t show the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) that you\u2019re\nroutinely defending your mark \u2014 and that\u2019s from any size business, large,\nsmall \u2014 then you\u2019re at risk of losing your trademark.\u201d\n\nTODAY.com reached out to Chile Colonial for comment about Momofuku purchasing\nthe Chile Crunch trademark from them and about a license to continue to use\nthe name but did not hear back at the time of publication.\n\n### Recommended\n\nWorld\n\n### WorldThe comeback of Notre Dame: American builders help to restore iconic\nParis landmark\n\nLatino\n\n### LatinoVenezuelans abroad want to vote in their country's presidential\nelection but face restrictions\n\nMariscal said Momofuku was \u201cstuck with a dilemma\u201d of how to handle and protect\nthe trademark without having the term \u201cchili crunch\u201d claimed by another\ncompany.\n\nAt the end of the podcast, Chang shared the future of Momofuku\u2019s plans with\nthe trademark, explaining, \u201cThe plan moving forward with this trademark is \u2014\nand it\u2019s a strange way of sort of taking the power away from it \u2014 by doing\nnothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to enforce the trademark,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by doing so, it\u2019s\npossible that it becomes a generic term and nobody can own it.\u201d\n\nMarsical added, \u201cAs a business, we\u2019re taking the risk that by not enforcing\nit. Someone could come along \u2014 someone much bigger than us \u2014 say we\u2019re not\nenforcing it, and therefore, they should own the mark.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Chang has become somewhat synonymous in the U.S. with Korean\nfine dining, microwave cooking and a host of Asian supermarket goods.\n\nAs a celebrity chef, he\u2019s no stranger to controversy: Chang isn\u2019t afraid to\nshare hot takes online, and he\u2019s been accused of facilitating toxic work\nenvironments in his restaurants. (Chang called accusations made in a 2020\nEater article \u201cconsistent with his behaviors at the time,\u201d and apologized,\nthough he didn\u2019t remember them specifically.) But this time, folks are fuming\nover his recent attempt to own the term \u201cchili crunch,\u201d which it uses for the\nchile-allium-oil condiment sold under the Momofuku brand.\n\nIn 2020, Momofuku started selling jars of chili crunch \u2014 a spicy condiment\ncommonly found across many Asian cultures made with chilis and oil \u2014 which it\nlaunched in 2018.\n\nThe product also goes by chili crisp, chili oil, crunchy chili sauce and\ncountless other names, and it took off exponentially across the American\ngrocery market in 2021, though Momofuku was not the first to bring it to\nshelves.\n\nThere are now dozens of brands selling to consumers across the country, and\nall of them have their own recipe twists and monikers. Some opt to include the\nword \u201ccrunch\u201d in the name, much like Chang\u2019s company did.\n\nOn April 4, the Guardian reported Momofuku is currently trying to trademark\n\u201cchili crunch\u201d with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Though it doesn\u2019t\nown the trademark yet, Momofuku allegedly sent cease-and-desist letters to an\nunknown number of brands that use \u201ccrunch\u201d in their condiment\u2019s name.\n\n## What small business owners had said in response\n\n\u201cThe phrase that I would use to refer to Momofuku in this case, is a trademark\nbully,\u201d says Stephen Coates, the lawyer representing New York-based Malaysian\nfood brand Homiah, which received a cease-and-desist. Homiah sells a Sambal\nChili Crunch.\n\nThe brand\u2019s founder, Michelle Tew, wrote in a LinkedIn post that the letter\n\u201cfelt like a punch in the gut.\u201d She told the Guardian that had she received a\ncease and desist from a large corporation like Kraft Heinz, it would have been\n\u201cdistressing,\u201d but \u201cthe fact that it was Momofuku makes me feel really, really\nsad.\u201d\n\nJing Gao, founder and CEO of Fly by Jing, a Sichuan chili sauce company, wrote\non LinkedIn that she is \u201cdisheartened\u201d to see Chang\u2019s company allegedly \u201cgo\nafter numerous brands including small minority women founded businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis kind of action, if successful, sets a dangerous precedent for the\nsquashing of fair competition, not to mention how ridiculous it is to try and\ntake ownership of a generic cultural term,\u201d Gao continued.\n\nShe told TODAY.com that as a business owner herself who was told in the past\nthat her chili crisp product was \u201ctoo niche\u201d for the American market, she sees\nmore competition as a good thing.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a zero-sum game, and there is enough space for everyone,\u201d Gao\nsaid. \u201cThe bigger we can grow the pie for all, the better it is for everyone.\u201d\n\nEric Huang, chef and founder of Pecking House, told TODAY.com that\n\u201ctrademarking food is an exercise in capitalist nonsense.\u201d Between all the\neffort he\u2019s seen is necessary for building a business, the work that goes into\nrecipe testing and the logistics of creating a food product, \u201cthe only reason\nyou would (trademark food) is for a soulless cash grab.\u201d\n\nHuang called the trademark filing \u201ca disappointing turn of events for someone\nwho so singularly represents AAPI in the food & beverage industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is so uncool,\u201d Kerry Diamond, founder of Cherry Bombe magazine and\nformer coffee shop owner, wrote in an Instagram caption. \u201cDave was once the\nlittle guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it isn\u2019t Dave Chang personally issuing this command,\u201d Huang says, \u201cbut\nrather his boardroom of likely rich, white dudes who got their MBA from Tuck.\u201d\n\nRachel Askinasi\n\nRachel Askinasi is a reporter covering the food industry including\nrestaurants, trends, agriculture, industry news and more.\n\n\u00a9 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL\n\nWe and our partners use cookies on this site to improve our service, perform\nanalytics, personalize advertising, measure advertising performance, and\nremember website preferences.
