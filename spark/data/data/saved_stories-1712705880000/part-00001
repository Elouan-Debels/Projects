In a shot across the bow to\nrival Amazon\u2019s Audible service, Spotify started offering free audiobook\nlistening time to paying customers last October.\n\nEarlier this month, it also introduced video learning courses that cost\nbetween \u00a311 and \u00a3240.\n\nThe Sweden-based company is reportedly considering a new basic subscription\nwithout audiobooks for the original price of the Premium Individual Tier\n(\u00a310.99). However, the email sent to customers does not mention the\nsubscription. A long-rumoured super-premium tier, with access to higher-\nquality audio, is also rumoured to be on the cards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re increasing the price of [subscriptions] so that we can continue to\ninvest in and innovate our product offerings and features, and bring you the\nbest experience,\u201d Spotify said in the email.\n\nSpotify previously raised subscription prices in the UK by \u00a31 extra per month\nlast summer. The company is trying to achieve profitability after a history of\nlosses.\n\nLast March, Spotify revealed that its all-time payouts to music-rights holders\nwere approaching $40 billion (\u00a331.6bn). It said it paid nearly 70 per cent of\nevery dollar it generated from music back to the industry.\n\nSpotify had 602 million users at the end of 2023, including 236 million paying\ncustomers.\n\n### Read More\n\nSpotify video learning courses: How much do they cost and how do you use them?\n\nAdvertisements on BBC audio content on Spotify could \u2018distort competition\u2019\n\nIndependent artists and labels enjoyed record year on Spotify in 2023 \u2013 report\n\nMORE ABOUT\n\nSpotify\n\nSubscriptions\n\nStreaming Service\n\nMusic\n\napps\n\nHave your say...\n\nVIEW\n\nCOMMENTS\n\n## Most Read\n\n  * 1\n\nLifestyle\n\nWhere did it all go so wrong for oat milk?\n\n  * 2\n\nFootball\n\nMan City XI vs Real Madrid: No De Bruyne - Starting lineup, confirmed team\nnews and injury latest today\n\n  * 3\n\nFootball\n\nArsenal XI vs Bayern Munich: Starting lineup, confirmed team news, injury\nlatest for Champions League today\n\n  * 4\n\nFootball\n\nReal Madrid vs Man City LIVE!
