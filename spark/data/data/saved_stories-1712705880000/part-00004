The magnetically levitated (\u201cmaglev\u201d) bullet train can\nreach speeds of 500 kilometers per hour and is scheduled to link Tokyo to\nNagoya in 40 minutes by 2027 and to Osaka in just 67 minutes by 2045.\n\nThat would hypothetically beat the current bullet train, the T\u014dkaid\u014d\nShinkansen, already running between those cities by about 50 minutes and an\nhour and a half, respectively.\n\nThe private company behind the project, JR Central, claims that the Linear\nwill bring huge economic benefits by bolstering Japanese industry \u2014\nparticularly if the maglev technology gets exported abroad.\n\nHowever, since construction began in 2014, many Japanese residents have only\nseen its rising costs with few of the anticipated advantages.\n\nFor starters, Japanese taxpayers are being asked to foot a large part of the\nstaggering JPY 9 trillion (USD 60.7 billion) in projected costs. In 2016, for\nexample, the administration of then Prime Minister Abe Shinz\u014d lent JR Central\nan astounding JPY 3 trillion (USD 20 billion) of ultra-low-interest, long-term\nloans from state funds.\n\nOn top of this, local prefectural governments and taxpayers are shouldering\nthe bills for constructing new train stations for the Linear. By JR Central\u2019s\nown estimates, the average cost for station buildings alone is JPY 35 billion\nyen (USD 236 million), even reaching JPY 220 billion (USD 1.4 billion) in the\ncase of Kanagawa Prefecture.\n\nThis seems like a steep price to pay especially when considering that JR\nCentral\u2019s own president admitted that the maglev won\u2019t turn a profit\ndomestically but will rather mainly be used to sell Japanese technology\nabroad.\n\nIn addition to taxpayers\u2019 wallets, the Linear is taking a toll on the natural\nenvironment as well.\n\nFor instance, while its supporters highlight the train\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d and\nCO2-saving credentials, the Linear will, in fact, use anywhere from three to\nfour times as much energy per person to power as the current T\u014dkaid\u014d\nShinkansen. Most of this energy will be sourced from fossil fuels and nuclear.\n\nMoreover, a staggering 90 percent of the Linear's journey from Tokyo to Osaka\nwill be entirely underground, including 70 kilometers that pass directly\nunderneath the pristine wilderness of the Japanese Alps.\n\nA map of the Linear Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen (\u201cmaglev\u201d) route overlaid with the\ncurrent, T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen. The Japanese Central and Southern Alps are in\nlight pink. The \u014ci River, in Shizuoka Prefecture, is light blue. Author\u2019s\nrendition, based on plans from JR Central \u00a9 Justin Aukema\n\nThis is already producing massive amounts of soil and dirt waste, some of\nwhich is contaminated with toxic chemicals such as arsenic and mercury, and\nalmost all of which have no decided use or storage location. It is estimated\nthat tunnel construction between Tokyo and Nagoya alone will produce 56.8\nmillion cubic meters of dirt.\n\nSince only a fraction of this can be reused, most is instead being used to\nfill in gorges and river valleys. But this has many experts and residents\nliving downstream fearful about possible landslides caused by heavy rains.\n\nOthers are worried about the impact of the tunnels on surrounding communities\u2019\nwater supplies, especially since many major streams and rivers originate under\nthe Japan Alps. Indeed, JR\u2019s own survey found that its tunnels would cause two\nmetric tons less water to flow into the \u014ci River every second. This has so\nworried the residents of Shizuoka Prefecture, who rely on the river for their\nlivelihoods, that Governor Kawakatsu Heita has withheld his approval for\nmaglev construction through the prefecture.\n\nThe Linear \u201cbrings absolutely no benefit to the prefecture,\u201d Kawakatsu stated.\n\nShizuoka resident Tsuji Hiroshi, 86, agreed. In an interview with the Asahi\nShinbun, he recalled when another train tunnel in the 1930s destroyed\nunderground aquifers and local farms. \u201cOnce the water's gone, it never comes\nback,\u201d he lamented.\n\nYet perhaps the greatest cost of the Linear project has been the human one.\n\nOn the night of October 28th, 2021, for example, tunnel worker Kosaka K\u014dki\n(44) was crushed to death by falling rocks while inspecting the results of a\ndynamite blast on a section of the Linear tunnels in Gifu Prefecture.\n\nAt least four other major workplace injuries have occurred in Nagano\nPrefecture alone during the maglev construction.\n\nAnd construction workers aren\u2019t the only ones feeling the pain. Many\nresidents, including 100 homes in Sagamihara, Kanagawa Prefecture, are being\nforcefully relocated to make way for the incoming train.\n\nSagamihara City is kicking residents out over a 13.7-hectare area to build a\nnew Linear station to the tune of JPY 53.8 billion (USD 363 million), 33\nbillion of which is coming from public funds.\n\nAlthough the affected residents are reimbursed, lands are seized under laws\nsimilar to eminent domain, and many are unhappy with the negotiation results.\n\nIn 2022, the city surveyed 373 residents about their thoughts on the new\nstation development, with 316 of those \u2014 an overwhelming 85 percent \u2014\nresponding that they were outright opposed to it. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the Linear,\u201d\nsaid elderly resident Akeishi Kazuko, whose house is one of those in the\nproposed demolition path, according to the survey report.\n\nLocal popular opposition has been so great that between 2016 and 2023, 780\nTokyo and Kanagawa residents filed a class action lawsuit against the Japanese\ngovernment for approving the Linear project without fully assessing its true\ncosts.\n\nA similar story has unfolded in Ida City, Nagano Prefecture, where 190\nhouseholds are being forcefully relocated to make way for a new Linear station\nthere.\n\nOne affected resident, Kubo Miki, told the local news outlet Shinano Mainichi\nShinbun that she feels she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really upset,\u201d said\nanother, \u201cit was a really quiet, peaceful place, and I thought I\u2019d live out my\nlast days there.\u201d\n\nOthers, including one elderly woman, have simply given up trying to push back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s useless to protest since it\u2019s a national policy,\u201d she said.\n\nResidents of Nagano\u2019s \u014cshika Village, a sleepy hamlet in the Southern Alps,\nare also unhappy. As a 2020 documentary explained, tunnel construction for the\nLinear there, where up to 1,763 dump trucks barrel down the narrow mountain\nroads per day, has already \u201cwreaked irreversible damage on the natural\necosystem and for local residents.\u201d\n\nLamenting the destruction of the village and its surroundings, local dairy\nfarmer Kobayashi Sunao said, \u201cOnce the natural environment has been destroyed,\nit\u2019s gone forever.\u201d\n\nIndeed, JR Central\u2019s plan to drill through the Japanese Alps has not been\npopular, especially with locals. A 2011 government survey, for instance, found\nthat 648 of 888 respondents, or 73 percent, said they were opposed to the Alps\nroute and that the plans should be scrapped.\n\nStill, much of this popular opposition seems to be falling on deaf ears.\n\nMeanwhile, at the end of the track, in Japan\u2019s Kansai region and the city of\nOsaka, where JR Central hopes to extend the Linear by 2045, many people still\naren\u2019t aware of its true costs.\n\nLocal businesses and politicians there have been eagerly promoting the new\nmaglev. Nara City, for example, released a promotional video for the train\nfeaturing pop idol \u014cnishi Momoka and has plastered JR Nara Station with pro-\nLinear advertisements.\n\nA staircase heading to JR Nara Station is painted with a pro-Linear ad that\nreads \u201cBring the Linear to Nara.\u201d Photo by the author. 4 January 2024.\n\nThe Osaka government has also voiced its strong support for the Linear.\n\nThere are some exceptions, however. Retired school teacher Kasuga Naoki and a\nsmall group of others started the Linear Citizen\u2019s Network Osaka in 2015 to\nraise awareness about the maglev\u2019s problems.\n\nThe group petitioned the Osaka government, calling for it to withdraw its\nsupport for the Linear, citing safety and cost concerns.\n\nBut they\u2019ve struggled to get their message to a wider audience.\n\n\u201cThe local government and some big businesses are pushing to get the Linear\nbuilt,\u201d he explained to Global Voices in a recent interview. \u201cThese pro-Linear\ngroups just emphasize how great the Linear is,\u201d but tend to ignore its\nnegative aspects.\n\nAs a result, \u201cmany people in Osaka [...] aren't aware of the Linear\u2019s\nproblems,\u201d he continued.\n\nStill, the Linear project continues to move forward. Now, many like Kasuga\nworry that people won\u2019t feel its true costs until it\u2019s already too late.\n\n### Categories\n\nRegions\n\n  * East Asia\n  * Japan\n\nTopics\n\n  * Development\n  * Environment\n  * History\n  * Politics\n  * Science\n  * Technology\n\nWritten byJustin Aukema\n\n## Support our work\n\nGlobal Voices stands out as one of the earliest and strongest examples of how\nmedia committed to building community and defending human rights can\npositively influence how people experience events happening beyond their own\ncommunities and national borders.\n\nPlease consider making a donation to help us continue this work.\n\nDonate now\n\n## Recent East Asia Stories\n\n### Philippine media groups condemn China\u2019s claim of \u2018manipulated\u2019 coverage of\nmaritime tension\n\nChina 15 hours ago\n\n### Navigating misconceptions and supporting Gaza from Taiwan\n\nIsrael 6 days ago\n\n### The legacy of the Sunflower Movement: Taiwan\u2019s emerging three-party\npolitics\n\nTaiwan (ROC) 1 week ago\n\nMore \u00bb\n\n## Top World Stories\n\n### What role for the French language in Togolese society?\n\nSub-Saharan Africa 2 days ago\n\n### Ghanaians debate online about the rights of a 16-year-old girl married to\na 63-year-old traditional priest\n\nSub-Saharan Africa 2 days ago\n\n### \u201cThe journey to the recognition of LGBTQ rights in Africa is an uphill\nclimb\u201d\n\nSub-Saharan Africa 3 days ago\n\nCancel this reply\n\n## Start the conversation\n\n### Menu\n\n## About Us\n\n  * What Is Global Voices?\n  * Our People\n  * Join us!\n  * Partner with Global Voices\n  * Donate\n  * Contact\n  * Translation Services\n  * Sponsors\n\n## Receive great stories from around the world directly in your inbox.\n\n## Sponsors\n\nGlobal Voices is supported by the efforts of our volunteer contributors,\nfoundations, donors and mission-related services.
