Octopus cannibalism among fears for pioneer cephalopod farm\n\n\u201cThese incredible animals deserve better than lives diminished to confinement\nand suffering,\u201d said Keri Tietge, octopus project consultant at Eurogroup for\nAnimals. - Copyright Georgios Kefalas/AP2009\n\nBy Marta Iraola Iribarren & Gerardo Fortuna\n\nPublished on 09/04/2024 - 16:37\u2022Updated 16:39\n\nShare this articleComments\n\nShare this article\n\nFacebookTwitterFlipboardSendRedditMessengerLinkedinVK\n\nNGOs are uniting against a pioneering octopus farm citing fears of cruelty\nincluding risk of cannibalism, while a forthcoming revision of animal welfare\nrules may see the European Commission plunge into the debate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor decades, breeding octopuses in captivity has proven a fish farming\nchallenge too far, with numerous failed attempts to reproduce cephalopods\noutside their natural habitat.\n\nWhen Spanish company Nueva Pescanova announced in 2019 that it had achieved\nthe unfeasible by cracking octopus reproduction in aquaculture, many hailed\nthe news as a scientific breakthrough.\n\nTo reap the rewards of its endeavour, the company is planning to open the\nfirst-ever octopus macro-farm along the shore of Spain\u2019s Canary Islands to\nproduce 3,000 tons of valuable cephalopod flesh each year.\n\nA number of scientists, environmentalist groups and animal welfare campaigners\nhave ruffled the feathers, however, voicing strong opposition to the project.\n\nA coalition of NGOs today (9 April) released a further call to \u201cimmediately\nstop the project on the grounds that, as well as causing cruelty to octopuses,\nthe farm contradicts its own corporate sustainability claims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese incredible animals deserve better than lives diminished to confinement\nand suffering,\u201d said Keri Tietge, octopus project consultant at the Brussels-\nbased animal protection association Eurogroup for Animals.\n\nAlongside environmental and food safety concerns, animal welfare is foremost\namong campaigners' concerns.\n\nOctopuses are solitary animals by nature, the associations argue in their\npublic statement, and therefore unfit to live in group and high-density\nconditions. Pointing out that they are carnivorous animals, they add that\n\u201cthis would increase aggression and can ultimately lead to cannibalism\u201d.\n\nContacted by Euronews, a Nueva Pescanova spokesperson said that the company\nwill continue with the necessary administrative procedures. According to their\nplans, the first farmed octopus would reach the market in 2027.\n\nThe facility is projected to host ten octopuses per cubic meter, stressing\nthat \u201cat all times, the physicochemical conditions of the water will be\ncontinuously monitored by means of automatic systems aiming to ensure animal\nwelfare as well as crop efficiency.\u201d\n\n## Authorisation no 'slam dunk'\n\nThe aquaculture company has already started breeding octopuses in tanks at a\nresearch facility in Galicia, northern Spain.\n\nThese would be the first to move into new facilities in Las Palmas de Gran\nCanaria and be commercialised once they mature to a year and half in age, when\nthey would supply key international octopus markets such as the US, South\nKorea, and Japan.\n\nDemand for octopus is on the uptick among restaurant diners according to a\n2022 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization of the\n(FAO).\n\nDespite initial plans to have its application approved by the end of 2023, the\nprocess has now been delayed as some local authorities have also registered\nconcerns.\n\nLast July, the government of the Canary Islands published opinions from\nvarious authorities and regional departments required to greenlight the\nintensive farm.\n\nThe harshest opinion came from the directorate general for public health of\nthe Canary Island government, which found that the octopus farm is planned for\nwaters that cannot guarantee suitable cultivation of a product fit for human\nconsumption.\n\nIn an impact assessment, it found uncontrolled discharges of various\nsubstances from the usual activity of the local port could impact the octopus\nto an extent \u201cunknown to say the least\u201d.\n\nThe Canary Islands government has also requested a further environmental\nimpact assessment acknowledging this project could have important adverse\neffects on the environment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn its final evaluation, it appears that Nueva Pescanova has still to give\ninformation as to the exact impact the installation will have on the\nenvironment and how it plans to maintain the current quality of the water.\n\n## Could the Commission dive in?\n\nFor the moment the issue remains national, but Octopus farming could become\nfurther entangled as a result of rising interest in animal welfare by the EU\nexecutive.\n\nThe EU treaties recognise animals as sentient beings and require this to be\ntaken into account when formulating EU policies in areas such as agriculture\nor fisheries.\n\nExisting EU animal welfare legislation does not apply to invertebrate species\nsuch as octopuses, a Commission spokesperson told Euronews.\n\nHowever the framework is currently undergoing a revision to broaden its scope\nand improve the level of animal welfare.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nComponents of this revision specifically related to farmed animals have been\npushed back to after the EU elections, and a proposal on protection of animals\nundergoing transportation was tabled last year which featured cephalopods and\ndecapods for the first time.\n\nThe Commission spokesperson said more scientific knowledge is needed to\nunderstand the welfare implications of farming cephalopods, and the EU\nexecutive has therefore asked for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to\ncome up with an indicative roadmap for animal welfare from 2023 to 2030 which\nwill include octopus.\n\nShare this articleComments\n\n## You might also like\n\n### \u2018Unique biodiversity\u2019: Scientists discover four new species of Octopus off\nthe coast of Costa Rica\n\n### Octopuses have feelings and crabs should not be \u2018boiled alive\u2019, says new\nreport\n\n### Octopuses may go blind as climate change pulls oxygen from the ocean\n\nCanary Islands octopus EU Policy Ocean animal welfare seafood\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Top stories\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## Top European court rules human rights violated by climate inaction\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## ISIS calls for attacks on Champions League quarter-finals\n\nNow playing Next\n\n## EU Policy.
