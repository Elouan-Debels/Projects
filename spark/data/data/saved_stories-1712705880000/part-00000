We'll be sharing these stories over the next several weeks.\n\nA sibling can change your life \u2014 even before you're born.\n\nThat's because when males and females share a womb, sex hormones from one\nfetus can cause lasting changes in the others.\n\nIt's called the intrauterine position phenomenon, or intrauterine position\neffects, and different versions of it have been observed in rodents, pigs,\nsheep \u2014 and, probably, humans.\n\n\"It's really kind of strange to think something so random as who you develop\nnext to in utero can absolutely change the trajectory of your development,\"\nsays Bryce Ryan, a professor of biology at the University of Redlands.\n\nThe phenomenon is more than a scientific oddity. It helped establish that even\ntiny amounts of hormone-like chemicals, like those found in some plastics,\ncould affect a fetus.\n\n### An oddity in ancient Rome\n\nCattle breeders in ancient Rome may have been the first people to recognize\nthe importance of a sibling's sex.\n\nThey realized that when a cow gives birth to male-female twins, the female is\nusually sterile. These females, known as freemartins, also act more like males\nwhen they grow up.\n\nScientists began to understand why in the early 1900s. They found evidence\nthat hormones from the male twin were affecting the female's development.\n\nThe effect is less obvious in other mammals, Ryan says. Female offspring in\nrodents, for example, can still reproduce, but they have measurable\ndifferences in sexual development and tend to be more aggressive.\n\nRelated Story: These identical twins both grew up with autism, but took very\ndifferent paths\n\nThe intrauterine position phenomenon occurs because the testes of male fetuses\nbegin producing testosterone early in development. Meanwhile, at this stage,\nthe ovaries in females \"don't produce much of anything,\" Ryan says.\n\nThis makes no difference when all the fetuses in a womb are of the same sex.\nBut when males and females are present, there can be some hormonal cross-talk,\nespecially in rodents, which can carry litters of a dozen or more pups.\n\n\"Those fetuses are packed so tightly together in the uterus, the testosterone\ncan travel through the amniotic fluid from pup to pup and can also be carried\nby the circulatory system,\" Ryan says.\n\nFemales squeezed between two males typically experience the most exposure to\ntestosterone and are most likely to exhibit hormonal and behavioral\ndifferences throughout their lives.\n\n### BPA and other hormone-like chemicals\n\nUsually, intrauterine position produces subtle changes that would matter only\nto a lab scientist or animal breeder.\n\nBut the phenomenon became part of a public debate in the early 2000s, thanks\nto a plastic additive called bisphenol A (BPA).\n\nBPA acts like a weak version of the hormone estrogen, and studies showed that\nsmall amounts were leaching out of some plastics and into people.\n\nRelated Story: Blended families are common. Here are tips to help stepsiblings\nget along\n\nAt one time, scientists might have assumed these low exposures were harmless.\nBut research on the intrauterine position phenomenon had shown that even trace\namounts of a sex hormone could affect a developing fetus.\n\n\"For a lot of people, this was a wake-up call \u2014 and maybe the first wake-up\ncall \u2014 that plastics were not universally good,\" Ryan says.\n\nSo BPA became a lightning rod for debates about the safety of chemicals that\ncan act like hormones in the body.\n\n\"As a physician, as a father, I would never on purpose expose my own children\nto BPA \u2014 I would not do it,\" pediatrician Alan Greene told a 2009 rally in\nCalifornia in support of a bill to ban BPA in products for young children.\n\nThe plastics industry responded with messages reassuring the public that \"the\ntrace amounts we are exposed to from materials that keep our food safe are\nsafe for us.\"\n\n### Humans and hormones\n\nScientists remain divided on the safety of BPA, phthalates and many other\nchemicals that can act like sex hormones, and the intrauterine position\nphenomenon has contributed to that debate.\n\nEarly on, research suggested that a fetus's position in the uterus could\naffect the very experiments used to assess the safety of BPA.\n\nOne study in the 1990s, for example, found that female mouse pups that had\ndeveloped between two males were much less sensitive to BPA compared with\nfemale pups that had gestated between two other females.\n\nThis meant that scientists needed to account for a mouse's place in the womb\nor they might miss any effects from BPA.\n\nRelated Story: At the heart of this cozy coffee shop lies a big sister's love\nfor her little brother\n\nAnd if hormones from a sibling were enough to confound an experiment, so might\nlots of other subtle factors, like the mouse strain used in an experiment, the\nkind of test used to measure BPA or the possibility that trace amounts of BPA\nhad contaminated an experiment.\n\nToday, scientists are still trying to understand those factors.\n\nThey are also trying to figure out whether the hormonal changes related to\nintrauterine position can affect people.\n\n\"Some studies have shown that opposite-[sex] twins, especially the females, do\nshow differences in behavior and may show differences in physiology as well, \"\nRyan says.\n\nThese differences include how many children they have, how their facial\nfeatures develop and how their brains process language.\n\nBut it's difficult to know for sure, Ryan says, because it's really hard to\nstudy a species that lives in the world, not a lab.\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": false}
