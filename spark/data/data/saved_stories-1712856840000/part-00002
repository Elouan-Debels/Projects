These platforms are engineered to\nfacilitate the integration of AI and ML at the edge of RF spectrum analysis.\n\nThe Matchstiq X40 is a compact, software-defined radio platform which\noptimizes its use in space and weight-limited environments. It provides RF\ncoverage up to 18GHz and supports instantaneous bandwidths up to 450MHz.\n\n\u2014 ADVERTISEMENT \u2014\n\nThe integration of the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX and AMD Ultrascale+ FPGA within\nthe X40 enables significant computational capabilities, facilitating the\nprocessing of complex algorithms for AI and ML at the RF edge.\n\nSpecifications for the Matchstiq X40:\n\n  * Integrated FPGA: AMD Zynq Ultrascale+ ZU7\n  * Integrated GPU/CPU: Nvidia Orin NX 16G\n  * RF Coverage: 1 MHz to 6 GHz or 1 MHz to 18 GHz\n  * Bandwidth: Up to 450 MHz\n  * Receivers: Up to 4\n  * Transmitters: Up to 2\n  * I/O: 1 GbE + USB 3.0 + Serial Port + GPIO + GPSDO\n  * Power Consumption: 40 \u2013 80W\n  * Dimensions: 9.75\u2032\u2032 x 4.25\u2032\u2032 x 1.45\u2032\u2032\n\nMatchstiq X40 (click image to enlarge)\n\nOn the other hand, the Matchstiq G Series, which includes the G20 and G40\nmodels, offers SDR solutions designed for SWaP-C optimization. The G Series\nSDRs come in a smaller form factor and they provide RF coverage up to 6GHz and\nsupport instantaneous bandwidths up to 50MHz.\n\nSimilar to the Matchstiq X40, these platforms are equipped with the NVIDIA\nJetson Orin NX 16GB. However, they feature the AMD Artix7 FPGA, offering\nenough processing power for advanced signal analysis tasks such as\nbeamforming, as per Epiq Solutions.\n\nSpecifications for the Matchstiq G20/G40:\n\n  * Integrated GPU/CPU: NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16GB for all\n  * Integrated FPGA: AMD Zynq (X40), AMD Artix7 (G20/G40)\n  * Bandwidth: Up to 50 MHz\n  * Receivers: Up to 4\n  * Transmitters: Up to 4\n  * I/O: 1 GbE + USB 3.0 + Serial Port + GPIO + GPSDO\n  * Power: 20 \u2013 50W\n  * Dimensions: 7.6\u201d x 4.4\u201d x 1.0\u201d\n\nMatchstiq G20/G40 (click images to enlarge)\n\nThese SDR platforms are intended to support localized AI/ML-enabled\napplications, reducing reliance on large server-based processing setups. The\nNVIDIA Jetson Orin NX\u2019s high-performance processing unit is capable of\nexecuting numerous operations per second, which facilitates extensive data\nanalysis in real-time on the platforms.\n\nJohn Orlando, CEO of Epiq Solutions, emphasizes the significance of these SDR\nplatforms in addressing the complex needs of edge-level RF spectrum analysis\nwith AI and ML applications in constrained environments.\n\nMatchstiq X40 & G Series (click images to enlarge)\n\nFurther Information\n\nEpiq Solutions has not provided pricing for the Matchstiq devices.
