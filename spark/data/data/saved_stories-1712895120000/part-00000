It\nwas thicker and heavier than normal spades but failed to stop even small\ncaliber bullets. It also had a large sight hole in the shovel blade for a\nrifle to poke through, making it a poor shovel. In 1914, 25,000 shield-shovels\nwere ordered and shipped to Europe for use by the 1st Canadian Division, and\nthen later scrapped. Sam Hughes had a string of failed inventions: \"Hughes\nequated masculinity with toughness, and argued that militia service would\ntoughen up Canadian men who might otherwise go soft living in an urban\nenvironment full of labor-saving devices.\" posted by AlSweigart (19 comments\ntotal) 12 users marked this as a favorite\n\nIt's bizarre how there seemed to be something about the Boer War that was\nabsolutely catnip for notably-incompetent colonialist assholes of a certain\nvintage.

Macdonald, often commented that Hughes's\nletters to him were \"voluminous\" and sometimes \"impertinent\" as he demanded\npatronage jobs for local Tories.[11]\"\n\n\"Hughes was sued for libel, there was an arson attempt against the Victoria\nWarder and was at least one assassination attempt against him when he was shot\nat while leaving his newspaper office.[15]\"\n\n\"The combative Hughes enjoyed brawling with Irish Catholic immigrants on trips\nto Toronto.[4]\"\n\n\"As the editor of the Victoria Warder, Hughes often attacked \"Romanists\" as he\ncalled Catholics. For an example in an editorial on 4 October 1889 he accused\nthe \"Romanists\" of Lindsay of being \"a disloyal murder-planning society\".[19]\"\n\n\"In January 1894, Hughes was involved in a brawl on Lindsay's main street with\na Roman Catholic blacksmith named Richard Kylie, which led him to being\nconvicted of assault and fined $500.[24] Despite expectations that the assault\nconviction would cause him to lose his seat, in the 1896 election, Hughes kept\nhis seat.[25]\"\n\n\"The more that the British Army rejected the Ross rifle as unsuitable, the\nmore it persuaded Hughes of its superiority, though Morton noted that the\nBritish objections to the Ross rifle were sound as it was a hunting rifle that\noverheated after rapid firing and was too easily jammed by dirt.[49]\"\n\nAnd all that is before we get to the \"Controversy\" section of his Wikipedia\narticle. posted by AlSweigart at 11:17 AM on April 8 [13 favorites]\n\nNeither a good inventor, nor a good person. posted by Saxon Kane at 11:21 AM\non April 8 [3 favorites]\n\nWell, also it was possible to assemble the Ross Rifle in such a way that it\nwould fire but also shoot the bolt back into the firer\u2019s skull, which is...\nnot optimal for a rifle.
