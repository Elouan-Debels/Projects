But the industry is getting more competitive\n\u2014 and flooded with AI. Abanti Chowdhury/BI\n\nClem De Pressigny\n\n2024-04-09T09:41:02Z\n\nFacebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link\n\nRead in app\n\nHOMEPAGE\n\nNewsletters\n\nLog in\n\nSubscribe\n\nMore than half of Gen Zers want to be full-time influencers, a recent Morning\nConsult poll found, and it's not hard to see why. They've grown up watching\ntheir peers on YouTube film makeup tutorials, narrate their \"Fortnite\" games,\nand explain money. It's both where they live their lives and where they learn\nabout the world. Plus, the career path sounds like a dream: You get to be your\nown boss, you can make more than you could at a traditional job, and you just\nhave to be good on camera. Success stories of influencers making millions of\ndollars have only galvanized the generation.\n\n\"Gen Z explicitly wants to become influencers, are trained to become\ninfluencers, do camps to become influencers, strategize in a variety of ways\nto become an influencer,\" Ang\u00e8le Christin, a professor at Stanford studying\nthe influencer industry, told me.\n\nA decade ago, many successful influencers stumbled into fame; they were just\nregular people sharing about their lives or showcasing a niche skill when they\nsuddenly found themselves with a huge audience and brands desperate to work\nwith them. Anyone could strike it lucky at any time. But over the past several\nyears, the influencer economy has shifted. Gone are the days when casual\nposting could suddenly turn into a lucrative career. On top of the work being\nan influencer requires, the competition gets tougher each day as more people\nvie for fame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo make matters worse, influencer wannabes aren't competing only with humans \u2014\nthey're soon going to be competing with artificial intelligence. Advancements\nin AI tech have given birth to an industry of AI influencers, and major\ncompanies are beginning to show interest in their far more cost-effective\napproach to marketing. And who can really compete with that?\n\nThe influencer market is thoroughly saturated, Nikita Baklanov, an analyst at\nthe influencer-marketing company HypeAuditor, said. Out of Instagram's some 2\nbillion monthly active users, \"only 800,000 accounts have over 100,000\nfollowers,\" he said, citing his company's research. That's less than 1% of\naccounts \u2014 but still a lot of accounts. And the number is growing.\n\nIn a crowded field, standing out takes work. Julia Broome, a social-media\nmanager for influencers and celebrities, is already seeing the impact on\nlongtime influencers. \"Creators that were able to get a big buzz or get a huge\nfollowing back in the day, they're experiencing some drop-off,\" she said.\n\nToday, most influencers need to have a variety of revenue streams to stay\nfinancially viable, Baklanov said. They need to offer subscriptions, create\ntheir own merch, or sell a course. Increasingly, they need to exist beyond\nsocial media. \"Platforms keep changing. The algorithms keep on changing. The\nformats keep on changing. And at some point, the influencers realize that they\nhave to build a loyal audience, and they have to take that audience outside of\nsocial-media platforms,\" Christin, the Stanford professor, told me. That means\nsetting up a podcast, running events, or creating a newsletter.\n\n> \"With tools like the AI image generator Midjourney and OpenAI's forthcoming\n> Sora, creating content is becoming much-more affordable.\"\n\nA Wall Street Journal article from 2021 suggested that the chances of making\nenough money from TikTok influencing for it to be an at least five-year career\nwere less than 0.0001%. Only 100 people out of more than 1 million will\nsucceed.\n\nAs the career path slips further out of reach, some people are turning to\ncreating user-generated content for brands, rather than for their own\naudiences. Broome told me she'd seen a \"big surge in UGC creators,\" who come\nat a much-lower cost to brands than traditional influencers. For creators,\nit's a nice way to make some money, but if your dream is to call your own\nshots for your own fan community, it's not a good sign. And now AI is poised\nto be another threat to job opportunities.\n\nIn 2016, Miquela Sousa, aka Lil Miquela, was born, as a fully formed Brazilian\nAmerican 19-year-old. With 2.7 million followers on Instagram Miquela has been\nreported to rake in over $10 million a year in brand deals, with campaigns for\nPrada and Calvin Klein. She, however, is not a real person.\n\nShe is one of roughly 200 virtual influencers, according to Virtual Humans, a\nsite that tracks these faux influencers, fueled by advanced motion graphics\nand a sizable team of people. Along with others, like Imma, who gets millions\nof views on TikTok, and Shudu, a virtual model, she proved people were willing\nto engage with someone who wasn't exactly real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiquela's success didn't spark a virtual-influencer revolution, but that was\nlargely because of cost \u2014 human influencers were still cheaper. In the past\ncouple of years, however, AI has advanced enough to make digital influencers\nmuch easier to create and run. With tools like the AI image generator\nMidjourney and OpenAI's forthcoming Sora, which makes extremely realistic\nvideos from text prompts, creating content is becoming much-more affordable.\n\"It costs almost nothing,\" Baklanov of HypeAuditor said. \"And they can\nactually duplicate it in different languages.\"\n\nAI-generated model Aitana has 200,000 Instagram followers and reportedly makes\n$11,000 a month with brand deals. The Clueless Agency\n\nCompanies have been quick to capitalize on the potential. Late last year, Meta\nannounced \"a universe of characters,\" fueled by AI, with Instagram and\nFacebook accounts you could message with. \"We've been creating AIs that have\nmore personality, opinions, and interests, and are a bit more fun to interact\nwith,\" the announcement said. An AI-model agency called The Clueless launched\nlast year with two models. The founder told Euronews, \"We did it so that we\ncould make a better living and not be dependent on other people who have\negos.\" Also last year, the AI-influencer company 1337 emerged from startup\nstealth mode with $4 million in backing. It has built dozens of AI entities\neach with niche interests, intricate backstories, and their own Spotify\nplaylists.\n\nAurora is a 24-year-old climate-crisis activist on a mission to preserve\nAntarctica. Ezra, a 20-year-old intellectual studying at Oxford, likes hanging\nout at flea markets and cozy caf\u00e9s. Wai is a 21-year-old abstract artist and\nsports enthusiast who's opened an art school for young talent.\n\nJenny Dearing, the company's cofounder and CEO, has been busy selecting\ncontent creators who can shape the behaviors of these entities via prompts.\nOnce paired with a person to run things, each AI influencer will create posts\nand videos and start interacting with its audience. The AI learns from each\ninteraction and uses the data that's gathered to become more engaging. It's no\nproblem for an AI persona to respond to every comment or question it receives,\nand turn that into instant feedback for whoever is running the show.\n\nThis model of influencing requires far less time from real people, and it's\nparticularly suited to those who are interested in influencing but don't want\nto put their own lives up for consumption. \"For us, the long game is enabling\nmore and more creators and brands to come in, create their own entity, manage\nthat entity, advocate for that entity, and evolve and grow them over time,\"\nDearing said.\n\n> \"Does it matter that an influencer is a human using AI tools or an AI\n> character guided by a human? Either way, they are trying to sell us\n> something.\"\n\nFor brands, being able to manage a consistent and engaging social-media\npresence at a low cost is an attractive pitch \u2014 and some have already\nexpressed interest, Dearing told me. She sees AI influencers being used to\nprovide a deep level of information, support, and guidance on brands and\nproducts. \"Product placement is such a tiny potential of the future,\" she\nsaid. \"For us, it's really a lot of knowledge exchange.\"\n\nIt will take time to see whether AI personas catch on, but the initial shift\nspells trouble for the future of influencing. Dearing doesn't think\ntraditional influencers will disappear, but she thinks a shift toward AI ones\nis possible. \"I see both scenarios existing for some period of time,\" she\nsaid. \"What that balance looks like, who knows?\" She added: \"Over time, maybe\nit's an 80-20 where brands get really excited about having that control\" and\nhuman influencers make up a smaller portion of the budget.\n\nDo AI influencers really stand a chance at building trust with an audience?\nMost marketing experts say that what audiences really want on social media is\nauthenticity. How you define that is up for debate, but it's clear that an AI-\ngenerated influencer is going to raise some eyebrows. After all, if a computer\nanimation is promoting a new skincare product, you probably wouldn't trust it\nas much as you would a human influencer swearing it was life-changing. On the\nflip side, though, anyone who has found themself apologizing to ChatGPT knows\nexactly how quickly we start to see AI as human.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2020 paper in the Journal of Advertising found that AI influencers \"can\nproduce positive brand benefits similar to those produced by human celebrity\nendorsers.\" But it also found that when things went wrong with an AI\ninfluencer, there was similar reputational brand damage. There's potential for\nfinancial harm, too: Earlier this year, an Air Canada AI chatbot gave\nincorrect information about a discount to a customer. A tribunal ruled that\nthe company was bound by that and had to provide a refund. A study in the\nEuropean Journal of Marketing found that consumers were just as likely to\nfollow an AI influencer as a human influencer but that they didn't trust the\nAI influencer as much. They were, however, more likely to talk with others\nabout the AI influencer, which could turn out to be a positive for brands.\n\nThe trust question may already be moot, though. As AI chatbots have become\nmore commonplace, most of us are already using them regularly. Chatbots are\nused for healthcare support, for therapy, and to warn teens of the dangers of\ntoo much social media \u2014 how different is an AI influencer, really? Was the Air\nCanada customer wrong to trust the AI bot's information? Clearly, the court\ndidn't think so.\n\nYou could even argue that there's something more authentic about a brand using\nan AI entity to market itself and engage with people than a human turning\nthemself into a brand to appeal to the algorithmic robots of a social-media\nplatform. We already know that influencers carefully craft their presentation,\noften with a manager or coach. Does it matter that an influencer is a human\nusing AI tools or an AI character guided by a human? Either way, they are\ntrying to sell us something.\n\nThe social-media-management platform Hootsuite's 2024 Social Media Trends\nreport said: \"The most successful brands will redefine 'authenticity.'\" The\nfocus won't be on who is creating the content but on whether the content is\ncompelling. As Dearing sees it, we're moving toward an information-driven\nexperience. \"Ultimately, these influencers become a really lovely visual way\nto engage on social platforms that are more knowledge-based,\" she said.\n\nSome experts have a significantly more pessimistic take: Eric Schmidt, a\nformer Google CEO, and Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist and author, wrote\nlast year about the potential for \"skillful manipulation of people by AI\nsuper-influencers.\" This would be possible, they suggested, by the potential\nfor generative AI to be highly personalized to individual wants, needs, and\ninterests. AI has also been used to create deepfakes of celebrities and\ninfluencers that can damage their reputations. Already, there's plenty of\ninterest from marketers in AI's ability to exploit consumer cognitive biases.\nEssentially providing marketers with a highly targeted, souped-up version of\nthe most effective human influencers.\n\nIf AI does catch on in the influencer world, Gen Z and Gen Alpha will have an\neven more challenging time striking influencer gold. What holds value online\nis already starting to undergo a fundamental shift, and influence will be up\nfor grabs.\n\nClem De Pressigny is a freelance writer and editor, and was previously the\neditorial director of i-D magazine.
