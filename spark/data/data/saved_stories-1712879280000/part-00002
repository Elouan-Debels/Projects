So, I made it. If you like running arbitrary code in your\nbrowser, try it out.\n\nLike (or hate) it? Comment on HackerNews\n\nstackoverflow_sort(\n\nTry a list of numbers, a string, a list of words or json.\n\n);\n\nStop running Start over\n\nvar output =\n\nOutput from the function.\n\nSorted using answer\n\nTry again with... a list of numbers a list of words a string json blob\n\nMention it on ... on Twitter on Hacker News\n\n;\n\noutput console\n\nHad enough? Stop it!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAs outlined by xkcd's recent alt text, this site downloads the top answers\nfrom StackOverflow for the tags \"javascript\" and \"sort\". It grabs the last\ncode block in the answer (in theory, the \"final\" example), and tries to\ndetermine which function should be called. It proceeds to eval the code from\nStackOverflow, with the inputted data as the first parameter for the function.\n\nIf it returns a wrongly-sorted list (or you just want to keep playing), a link\nto \"Try the next answer\" will appear under the result.\n\nYou can view the code on GitHub. If you see any bugs (or just want to berate\nme), please file an issue.\n\nIs it safe?\n\nUh... it evals both user input and random code, unchecked, from an external\nsite. This is what security-minded folks would refer to as Very BadTM.\n\nThat being said, for what it is, it should be relatively harmless. The site\nwill only fetch accepted answers, and it only uses answers that were posted\nbefore the xkcd was released (meaning that if someone posted malicious code\nnow, it wouldn't matter). It also searches for potentially-malicious code\n(like the word \"cookie\"), and skips those. It's definitely not the safest\nthing, however at most it would probably just crash your browser.\n\nShamefully created by Gregory Koberger. Follow me on Twitter. I'm so sorry.\n\n(Thanks to xkcd for the idea, and Eric Willis for helping out)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
