Don't count on it\n\nThe AI chip was first announced in December, the same day as its chatbot\nGemini. The new TPU, or tensor processing unit, can train large language\nmodels almost three times faster than its predecessor, Google\u2019s TPU v4, the\ncompany said. Large language models (LLMs) power AI chatbots like ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle\u2019s announcement marks another milestone in Big Tech\u2019s AI arms race.\nNvidia is the main supplier of the AI chips known as GPUs, or graphics\nprocessing units. Google parent Alphabet is one of Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers,\nbehind Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are all developing their own AI chips.\n\nBut Nvidia is still important to Google. In the same blog post announcing its\nlatest AI chip, Google mentioned Nvidia 20 times. Right under its detailing of\nthe TPU v5p, the company said it\u2019s updating its A3 supercomputer, which runs\non Nvidia GPUs. And Google reminded users that it\u2019s using Nvidia\u2019s latest\nchip, the Blackwell, in its AI Hypercomputer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Google also its new Arm-based CPU, Axion\n\nGoogle also announced an Arm-based central processing unit called Google Axion\nto rival the CPUs of Microsoft and Amazon. The British tech company Arm\nlicenses its design for chips\u2019 infrastructure for actual chip manufacturers to\nbuild upon. Google\u2019s new chip marks the first time it has licensed Arm\u2019s chip\ninfrastructure for a CPU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle said its new Arm-based CPU provides \u201cup to 30% better performance than\nthe fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances available in the cloud today,\nup to 50% better performance and up to 60% better energy-efficiency\u201d than\nother general purpose Arm chips.\n\nGoogle customers can use Axion CPU on its cloud services, which basically\nmeans those users would be opting to run their cloud services on a more\nefficient computer processor in Google\u2019s physical data centers. Google also\ntold Reuters that \u201ccustomers using Arm anywhere can easily adopt Axion without\nre-architecting or re-writing their apps.\u201d Its rivals Amazon and Microsoft\nhave already developed Arm-based CPUs.\n\n## \ud83d\udcec Sign up for the Daily Brief\n\nOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every\nweekday morning.\n\n", "frontpage": true}
