Perhaps even odder, the top-ranking spot on the list\nwas the good ol' Mile High City \u2013 Denver, Colorado.\n\nAffordability and high restaurant rankings helped Denver earn the spot at the\ntop of the list. While the average Yelp rating of local pizza restaurants was\na high 4.05 (compared to New York's 3.93), the price of a large cheese pizza\nwas just $16.79 ($11.81 cheaper than a $28.60 cheese pizza in NYC).\n\nIt's also worth noting that Denver is home to 9.5 pizza restaurants per\n100,000 residents \u2013 above a national average of 8.4. In fact, Denver ranked\nbetter than the national average across the board \u2013 better pizza that's\ncheaper and with more local interest in the hugely popular and shareable\nItalian dish.\n\nThis isn't the first time Denver has been given a nod for its local pizza\nscene \u2013 it was ranked as the 7th-best spot for pizza in 2023 by the same\npublication, but it's perhaps the first time anyone has claimed that there's\nno better spot for this dish nationwide than Denver.\n\n### Featured Local Savings\n\nA few of the top-ranking pizza places in Denver include Brooklyn's Finest (4.5\nstars on Yelp), Blue Pan Pizza (4.4 stars on Yelp), Redeemer Pizza (4.3 stars\non Yelp), and Pizza 3.14 (4.5 stars on Yelp).\n\nA quick look at all four of those top-rated restaurants does reveal a unique\nquality that may have helped propel Denver's pizza scene to the top of the\nClever list \u2013 diversity. In a city known for accumulating transplants from\naround the country, Colorado's pizza seems to reflect the same eclectic mix of\nregional styles \u2013 it's got great New York City-style pizza, it's got great\nChicago deep dish, it's got great Detroit-style pan 'za.\n\nWould you say Denver's pizza scene can compete with the best of them? Let us\nknow in the comments.\n\nFind the full city-by-city pizza ranking from Clever here.\n\nSTAY INFORMED: Get free Colorado news with our daily newsletter (Click here)\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * WhatsApp\n  * SMS\n  * Email\n  * Print\n  * Save\n\n#### Spencer McKee\n\n  * Author twitter\n  * Author email\n\n### Recent News\n\n#### Colorado sheriff's office saves teens \"very stuck\" in deep snow on closed\nroad\n\n#### Forecaster spent 6 hours 'pinned to tree' after getting hit by avalanche\nin Colorado\n\n#### Denver neighborhood an 'urban haven,' blending big city amenities with\nrural comforts\n\n#### Mobility assistance vehicles spread reach across Colorado Springs area\ntrails\n\n#### Motorless Morning returning to Garden of the Gods\n\n#### 10 easy meals to make cooking while camping a breeze\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nRecommended by\n\n### Search\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 - 2021 OutThere Colorado, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n\n#### main\n\n  * Home\n  * News\n  * Adventures\n  * Features\n  * Getaway Guides\n  * Things to Do\n  * Where to Go\n  * Newsletter Sign-Up\n\n#### Info\n\n  * Advertise\n  * Our Mission\n  * About\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Affiliate Policy\n\nManage Cookies\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * LinkedIn\n  * YouTube\n  * Pinterest\n  * Instagram\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 The Denver Gazette, 30 East Pikes Peak Ave., Suite 100 Colorado Springs, CO | Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Choices\n\nPowered by BLOX Content Management System from BLOX Digital.\n\n#### Browser Compatibility\n\nYour browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.
