Software has\ntransformed from a means of operating hardware-based weapons systems to being\nthe essential driver of nearly all the Army's weapons, business, and training\nplatforms. The Army must be able to rapidly develop and upgrade these\nsoftware-based capabilities to maintain a competitive advantage. To meet this\nchallenge, the Army recently announced a new policy changing its approach to\nsoftware development.\n\nThe new policy institutionalizes modern software development approaches across\nthe Army, in line with industry best practices. These approaches \u2013 which\ninclude agile and lean practices \u2013 focus on iterative development and delivery\nof software in close coordination with users. This type of development allows\nsoftware to be rapidly developed and refined over time, accelerating the\nArmy\u2019s ability to deliver needed capabilities to soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning from current conflicts \u2014 including in Ukraine \u2014 that the\nArmy\u2019s success on future battlefields will depend on our ability to rapidly\nupdate software and disseminate it to the operational force,\u201d said Secretary\nof the Army Christine Wormuth. \u201cSoftware development must be a source of our\nmilitary advantage and the Army\u2019s new software policy will ensure we have the\nright processes in place to inject innovation quickly and achieve a digital\ntransformation of our warfighting capabilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur traditional approach to software is no longer meeting the demands of our\nwarfighters,\u201d said Gabe Camarillo, Under Secretary of the Army. \u201cThis policy\nrepresents a significant effort to comprehensively adjust our legacy software\ndevelopment processes in line with private sector best practices. These\nchanges will fundamentally reshape how we develop and acquire software, making\nus more agile and innovative.\u201d\n\nTo accelerate adoption of these modern approaches, the policy reforms many of\nthe institutional processes that underpin the software development lifecycle,\nwhich have historically been cumbersome and time intensive. This includes\nchanging the way requirements for software systems are written, the types of\nacquisition strategies and buying models employed, and how the Army writes its\nrequests for proposals and contracts with vendors. It also streamlines and\nmodernizes the test and evaluation activities required, and changes how these\nsolutions are assessed for cyber vulnerabilities. Lastly, it modifies the way\ncost estimates for agile software solutions are developed and how these\nsystems are supported and maintained over time. As talent is a key driver for\nsuccess, the policy also includes several initiatives focused on developing\nthe talent and expertise needed to execute modern software development.\n\nThe reforms these institutional processes through a series of targeted reform\ninitiatives, which can be summarized by five key changes:\n\n1\\. Changing the Way Requirements Are Written: Software requirements will be\ncaptured in concise, high level needs statements in place of the detailed,\nprescriptive requirements documents used in the past. In line with industry\nbest practices, soldiers will be continuously involved throughout the process\nto ensure solutions are refined over time consistent with user needs.\n\n2\\. Employing Flexible Acquisition and Contracting Strategies: Acquisition and\ncontracting strategies for software development efforts will provide the\nability to quickly adapt to changing requirements. This includes maximizing\nuse of the Software Acquisition Pathway, which is tailored for rapid and\niterative delivery consistent with industry practices; employing flexible\ncontracting strategies such as modular contracting; and using the appropriate\ncontract types that allow for refinement of the requirements as the software\nevolves and user needs change.\n\n3\\. Streamlining and Modernizing Key Processes: Traditional, manual processes\nassociated with software development and deployment will be streamlined and\nmodernized to reduce the time and resources required to deliver software. This\nincludes reducing duplicative test requirements and streamlining cybersecurity\nprocesses, including the process to achieve authority to operate on Army\nnetworks.\n\n4\\. Adopting a New Sustainment Model: Software-based systems will no longer\nfollow the traditional process in which a system transitions to sustainment\nonce development is complete. In line with industry best practices, these\nsystems will instead plan for continuous improvement and development over the\nentirety of the lifecycle. This change recognizes that modern software\ndevelopment is never complete.\n\n5\\. Developing Talent & Expertise: Personnel trained in various aspects of\nmodern software development practices will be made available to assist Army\norganizations in the implementation of modern software development practices.\nThis includes establishment of the Digital Capabilities Contracting Center of\nExcellence at Aberdeen Proving Ground to improve and streamline contracting\nprocesses for software development efforts. And the establishment of the\nSoftware Management and Response Team, a centralized team of software\ndevelopment experts at Army Headquarters, to provide expertise and support to\nsoftware efforts planned across the enterprise. Simultaneously, the Army will\nexplore ways to more broadly attract, retain, and train personnel skilled in\nmodern development.\n\nThe policy goes into effect immediately. As best practices in software\ndevelopment continue to evolve, the Army will adapt its guidance, as\nappropriate.\n\n#### RELATED STORIES\n\n  * February 27, 2024Army changes force structure for future warfighting operations\n  * September 21, 2023Transcript: Media Roundtable with Douglas Bush, ASA for AL&T, September 19, 2023\n  * September 6, 2023Army Announces Plans for M1E3 Abrams Tank modernization\n  * September 1, 2023Army expands mental health support by implementing the Brandon Act\n  * August 22, 2023Army rolls out new contract writing software system\n  * April 12, 2022U.S. Army STAND-TO! | Army Organic Industrial Base Modernization Implementation Plan\n  * March 19, 2021Army Extends Timeline for Postpartum Soldiers to Meet Body Fat Standards\n\n  * Official U.S. Army Facebook\n  * Official U.S. Army Twitter\n  * Official U.S. Army YouTube\n  * Official U.S. Army Instagram\n  * Official U.S. Army LinkedIn\n\n  * Home\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy\n  * Terms Of Use\n  * Accessibility\n  * FOIA\n  * No FEAR Act\n\n## Social Sharing\n\n  * Share on Twitter\n  * Share on Facebook\n  * Share on Reddit\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n  * Share via Email\n\n", "frontpage": false}
