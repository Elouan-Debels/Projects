OpenDyslexic was compared to Arial and\nTimes New Roman in three reading tasks: (a) letter naming, (b) word reading,\nand (c) nonsense word reading. Data were analyzed through visual analysis and\nimprovement rate difference, a nonparametric measure of nonoverlap for\ncomparing treatments. Results from this alternating treatment experiment show\nno improvement in reading rate or accuracy for individual students with\ndyslexia, as well as the group as a whole. While some students commented that\nthe font was \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cdifferent\u201d, none of the participants reported\npreferring to read material presented in that font. These results indicate\nthere may be no benefit for translating print materials to this font.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### Reciprocal relationships among reading and vocabulary over time: a\nlongitudinal study from grade 1 to 5\n\nArticle Open access 30 March 2024\n\nCallula Killingly, Linda J.

Within the USA, the prevalence rate of\ndyslexia is estimated to be between 10 and 15 % (Fletcher, Lyon, Fuchs, &\nBarnes, 2007; Eden & Moats, 2002). Since its discovery, dyslexia has been\nhighly researched and debated (Washburn, Binks\u2010Cantrell, & Joshi, 2013).\nResearchers in a variety of disciplines, including medicine, psychology, and\neducation, have contributed to our understanding of dyslexia, as well as the\nmethods and interventions that are effective for students with this\ndisability.\n\nSeveral authorities have put forth definitions of dyslexia. IDA has adopted\nthe definition of dyslexia published by Lyon et al. (2003):\n\n> Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neurological in origin.\n> It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word\n> recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties\n> typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language\n> that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the\n> provision of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may\n> include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience\n> that can impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge (p.2).\n\nDyslexia is also included within the Individuals with Disabilities Education\nAct (IDEA, 2004), within \u201cspecific learning disability (SLD)\u201d, one of the 13\ndisability categories. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (DSM-V; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) includes dyslexia\nwithin \u201clearning disorder.\u201d Unfortunately, the inconsistency in terminology\nand the lack of one universally agreed upon definition of dyslexia has caused\nsome confusion among special educators, administrators, and parents. However,\nmost agree that dyslexia is a distinct type of SLD that presents in a\ndifficulty with phonological coding (Shaywitz et al., 2004; Snowling, 2009).\n\nAs reading and writing have become increasingly crucial for success in and out\nof school, students with dyslexia are often at-risk for academic failure,\nlower reading self-efficacy (Burden, 2008), and lower self-esteem (Alexander-\nPasse, 2006) as well as an increased risk of dropping out of school (U.S.\nDepartment of Education, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative\nServices, Office of Special Education Programs, 2006). Due to the potential\nfor poor school and post-school outcomes, teachers, parents, and advocates\noften feel desperate to locate and employ accommodations and interventions to\nhelp students with dyslexia read.\n\nRecently, two specialized typefaces or fonts \u201cOpenDyslexic\u201d (OD; Gonzalez,\n2012) and \u201cDyslexie\u201d (Boer, 2008) have been developed that purport to increase\nreadability for those with dyslexia. These fonts differ from the other, more\ntraditional fonts because the letters have been designed to have thicker or\n\u201cheavier\u201d lines near the bottom of the letters (See Fig. 1). The typeface\ndevelopers of these fonts claim that this \u201cheaviness\u201d prevents the letters\nfrom turning upside down for readers with dyslexia, and makes it easier for\npeople with dyslexia to distinguish individual letters while reducing reading\nerrors and the effort it takes to read text\n(http://www.studiostudio.nl/en/information/).\n\nFig. 1\n\nOpenDyslexic font. Source: BBC.com\n\nFull size image\n\nPerhaps, the typeface developers developed this font based on the same\nmisconception that dyslexia is characterized by letter reversals, what is\ncommonly held by teachers (Washburn et al., 2013). However, four decades of\nresearch on dyslexia suggests reading difficulties stem from more basic\ndeficits in alphabetic and phonological coding are the probable causes of the\ndisorder rather than visual, semantic, or syntactic deficits (Vellutino,\nFletcher, Snowling, & Scanlon, 2004).\n\nDespite this erroneous foundation, these newly designed fonts have captured\npublic attention across the world. National Public Radio, Scientific American,\nand eschool news (http://www.eschoolnews.com/2015/09/04/dyslexia-online-\nfont-593/comment-page-1/#comment-230792) have featured interviews with one of\nthe developers, and several websites contain numerous testimonials touting the\nbenefits of the specialized fonts. Additionally, many of these websites\nhighlight these testimonials on social media sites such as Facebook,\nheightening its visibility.\n\nToday, the U.S. Department of Education places an increased emphasis on\ngreater rigor in educational research (Institute of Educational Sciences,\n2010), and legislative mandates call for the use of research-based practices\nin schools (NCLB, 2001; ESRA, 2002; IDEIA, 2004). These legal and policy\nchanges as well as calls from the research academy (e.g., Horner et al., 2005;\nGersten et al., 2005) further movements for evidence-based interventions,\npractices, or treatments in the field of special education (Odom, 2009; Odom\net al., 2005), thus highlighting the importance of investigations into the\nefficacy of specialized fonts. Yet, no empirical research could be identified\nthat investigated the effectiveness of the font with English readers, and very\nlittle research exists on its effectiveness in readers of other languages.\n\n### Extant research\n\nTwo studies have investigated the effect of specialized fonts used with\nstudents with dyslexia. Rello and Baeza-Yates (2013) measured eye-tracking\nrecordings of Spanish readers with dyslexia (aged 11\u201350) and found that OD did\nnot significantly improve reading time nor shorten eye fixation. In her\nmaster\u2019s thesis, de Leeuw (2010) compared Arial and Dyslexie with 21 Dutch\nstudents with dyslexia and found Dyslexie did not lead to faster reading, but\nmay help with some dyslexic-related errors. To date, no peer-reviewed research\nstudies report the use of a \u201cdyslexia-friendly\u201d font with English-speaking and\nEnglish-reading students. Thus, research is needed to determine the\neffectiveness of a dyslexia-friendly font on reading rate and accuracy in\nEnglish-speaking students identified with dyslexia prior to its widespread\nuse.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of the current investigation is to determine the\neffectiveness of a specialized dyslexia font on reading speed and accuracy on\nthree reading tasks: (a) letter naming, (b) word reading, and (c) nonsense\nword reading. These three types of reading tasks were selected based on their\nstrong correlation to reading achievement and ability to measure both reading\naccuracy and speed. The independent variables compared were the fonts (a)\nArial, a san serif font; (b) Times New Roman (TNR), a serif font; and (c) OD,\na specialized dyslexia font. Here, Arial and TNR both commonly used fonts are\nbaseline conditions 1 and 2, respectively. OD is the treatment condition.\n\n## Method\n\nThe current investigation utilized a single-subject alternating treatment\ndesign to determine the differences among three separate fonts within three\nreading tasks in elementary school students identified with dyslexia. Single-\nsubject research is considered a rigorous, scientific experimental methodology\nused to establish evidence-based practices. The purpose of single-subject\ndesigns is to document functional relationships between independent and\ndependent variables thus focusing on practical significance as an outcome\n(Horner et al., 2005). Single-subject research data is typically compared\nsystematically thought visual representations within and across conditions of\na study using graphic representations (Alberto & Troutman, 2009).\n\n### Setting and participants\n\nStudents attending a K-12 independent urban school for students with dyslexia\nand related disorders, located in the southeast USA, participated in this\nstudy, with a total school enrollment of 160. Students who were invited to\nparticipate were those who were (a) of elementary age, (b) with confirmed and\ncurrent diagnoses of dyslexia (or a specific learning disability in the areas\nof phonological processing or decoding based on psycho-educational assessments\nconducted by an outside evaluator required for admission to the school), (c)\nwith normal vision, and (d) no comorbid diagnoses (e.g., attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder, autism). Of the 13 students who were identified and\ninvited, 12 returned, signed parental consent forms and participated in this\nstudy. Table 1 provides information about the age, grade, gender, ethnicity,\nand lexile levels of the participants. Of students that participated in the\nstudy, seven were female and five were male. Three students were in third\ngrade, three in fourth grade, two in fifth grade, and four were in sixth\ngrade. Their lexile levels ranged from 120 to 1137. The probes created by the\nauthors were based on the lower lexile scores of the participants.\n\nTable 1 Participants\n\nFull size table\n\n### Measures/dependent variables\n\nWithin single case research design, dependent variables should be selected for\ntheir social significance (Horner et al., 2005). Therefore, three types of\nreading tasks were selected because of their strong correlation to reading\nachievement and sensitivity to both reading accuracy and speed: (a) letter\nnaming (Fuchs, Compton, Fuchs, Bouton, & Caffrey, 2011), (b) real word\ndecoding, and (c) nonsense word decoding (Nunes, Bryant, & Barros, 2012;\nKendeou, van den Broek, White, & Lynch, 2009). Further, these tasks directly\nmeasure the anecdotal claims made by the font developers. The letter-naming\nprobes acted as a measure of rapid automatic naming and letter identification\nin isolation. The real word list provided a measure of word reading or\ndecoding and the nonsense word list allowed for a measure of sound-symbol\ncorrespondence that was free from effects of previous reading learning and\nmemorization. A measure of reading comprehension was not selected because\nreading comprehension can be influenced by many other reading and executive\nfunctioning skills unrelated to decoding of print.\n\n### Stimulus material\n\nThree sets of research-created probes were created, one set for each reading\ntask: (a) letter-naming, (b) real word decoding, and (c) nonsense word\ndecoding (See Fig. 2). The letter-naming probes contained a list of randomly\nordered upper and lowercase letters. The real word list contained phonetically\nregular one- and two-syllable words. The nonsense word list contained nonreal\nwords following typical orthographic patterns. From each set, seven randomly\nordered lists were generated. Each list was then printed in each of the three\nfonts (Arial 12, OD 10, TNR 12). The nominal font sizes varied in order to\nkeep the physical size of the font consistent across probes. Each list\nconsisted three columns of double-spaced rows and was printed on standard\nwhite copy paper.\n\nFig. 2\n\nProbe examples: letter naming in TNR, words in OD, and nonsense words in Arial\n\nFull size image\n\n### Procedure\n\nFor each session, participants read a letter-naming list, a real word list,\nand a nonsense word list each for one minute. If a student hesitated for 4 s,\nhe or she was prompted to skip that item and move to the next one. A digital\ntimer with an audible alarm/bell was used to time each 1-min reading session.\nThe researchers recorded student responses on identical observer copies of the\nstudent probes. A random-number calculator (Microsoft Excel) was used in order\nto randomize the font sequence to ensure the order of presentation did not\naffect the decoding rate or accuracy.\n\n### Inter-observer agreement\n\nEach session was audio-recorded. Later, a graduate student not familiar with\nthe research question compared the researcher-marked observer copy to the\naudio recording. Inter-observer agreement was calculated with the following\nformula: agreements/(agreements + disagreements). Inter-observer agreement was\nconducted on at least 96 % of all administrations with a median agreement of\n100 % (range = 99.3\u2013100 %) for letter naming, 100 % (range = of 98.2\u2013100 %)\nfor real word reading, and 100 % (range = of 97.9\u2013100 %) for nonsense word\nreading.\n\n### Experimental design\n\nThis study utilized an alternating treatment design (ATD), a form of single-\nsubject research, to investigate the effects of the specialized dyslexia font,\nOD, compared to Arial and Times New Roman fonts on reading accuracy and speed\nin elementary-aged readers with dyslexia. ATD is an ideal design for comparing\nthe effects of two or more treatments in applied research, and can identify\nthe presence or absence of a causal relationship between the independent\nvariable (e.g., font type) and a change in the dependent variable (e.g.,\nreading speed and accuracy (Smith, 2012). ATDs control for internal threats to\nvalidity related to inter-subject variability by essentially dividing each\nparticipant into multiple identical participants receiving each treatment\n(Martella, Nelson, & Marchand-Manella, 1999). Further, ATDs that include\nrandom assignment of treatment order and replication across multiple\nparticipants rule out rival hypotheses, resulting in elegant control of\ninternal threats to validity (Horner et al., 2005).\n\n### Data analysis\n\nThe results of this study were analyzed through visual analysis, as well as\nnonparametric statistical analysis.\n\nVisual analysis was used to evaluate the outcomes of this study. A positive\neffect is present when there is (a) a consistent level, trend, and variability\nwithin each phase or condition; (b) an immediate effect, proportion of\noverlap, consistent data across phases, and projected patterns of the\ndependent variable to determine the presence of an intervention effect; and\n(c) absence of anomalies within the data (e.g., sudden changes in level or\ntrend).\n\nWhile visual analysis has been shown to be effective in detecting large,\npractically important and clinically significant participant outcomes, it can\nbe insensitive to smaller effects (Glass, 1997; Parsonson & Baer, 1992).\nTherefore, we also conducted statistical tests to identify and summarize the\neffect of each font.\n\nBecause the data did not meet the parametric assumptions (e.g., parametric\nassumptions of normally distributed data, homogeneity of variance of the\nresiduals, and the independence of the distribution of the residuals;\nCampbell, 2004; West & Hepworth, 1991; Hersen & Barlow, 1976), a nonparametric\neffect size calculation was used. Distribution-free nonparametric models are\nnot impeded by these parametric assumption violations (Parker & Vannest, 2009)\nand are a measure of practical significance (Parker, Vannest, & Brown, 2009).\n\nWhile there are several nonparametric methods for calculating effect size for\nSCDs, improvement rate difference (IRD) was selected for use here because it\nis an intuitive approach that makes use of established effect sizes (e.g.,\nPhi, Cohen\u2019s Kappa and Cramer\u2019s V). IRD is the difference in improvement rates\nbetween baseline and treatment phases (Parker et al., 2009) and is commonly\nused in medical research under the terms \u201crisk difference\u201d or \u201crisk reduction\u201d\n(Vannest, Harrison, Temple-Harvey, Ramsey, & Parker, 2010). Confidence\nintervals and p values for IRD can also be calculated using commonly available\nstatistics modules. The strengths of IRD for single case research are\ndescribed at length in Parker et al. (2009).\n\nIRD is calculated by finding the difference between the improvement rate in\nbaseline and the improvement rate in treatment. The improvement rate is for\neach phase is the number of \u201cimproved data points\u201d divided by the total data\npoints in that phase. In a treatment phase, an improved data point is any\npoint that exceeds all data points in the baseline phase. Within a baseline\nphase, an improved data point is one that ties or exceeds any points in the\ntreatment phase. IRD is then calculated from these two independent\nproportions. For this analysis we used the online calculator (Relative Risk\nand Risk Difference Confidence Intervals, version 1.0, Buchan, 2004; available\nat http://www.phsim.man.ac.uk/risk/Default.aspx).\n\nThe maximum score is 100 % IRD and occurs when there is no overlap between\ntreatment and baseline. A 50 % IRD, or chance levels of improvement, occurs\nwhen half of the scores overlap between phases. A negative IRD score occurs\nwhen the treatment deteriorates below baseline levels (Parker et al., 2009).\n\nConfidence intervals were also calculated around IRD to provide a measure of\nconfidence, so that we can conclude with 95 % confidence that the true\ndifference between the two conditions (Arial vs OD, TNR vs OD) lies within the\ncalculated interval.\n\n## Results\n\nEleven of the 12 students completed each of the three reading task probes\n(i.e., letter-naming, word reading, and nonsense word reading). One male\nstudent was removed from the nonsense word reading on the second day of data\ncollection because his articulation patterns interfered with accurate scoring.\nHis nonsense word reading results were not included in this analysis.\n\n### Visual analysis\n\nThe whole group data and graphs were evaluated by the visual analysis\nprocedures described above. For both measures (i.e., speed and accuracy) of\neach reading task (i.e., letter naming, word reading, and nonsense word\nreading), the visual analysis of the data does indicate an overall increasing\ntrend over time, as one would expect with the effect of practice (see Figs. 3,\n4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). However, no individual trend line for any of the specific\nfonts demonstrated a stronger increasing trend than any other. Further, the\nsignificant amount of overlap between each of the individual font data lines\nindicates that no one font lead to significantly better or worse reading\naccuracy or speed. Further, individual student graphs and data were also\nanalyzed to investigate individual effects, none of which demonstrate a\npositive effect (Please contact the first author for copies of individual\nstudent graphs).\n\nFig. 3\n\nOverall average letter naming fluency (letters correct per minute).

The confidence intervals take into account the number of\nparticipants and observations, describe how reliable survey results are, and\nprovide a range within which the parameter is likely to lie.\n\nTable 2 Fluency effect (correct letters or words per minute)\n\nFull size table\n\nTable 3 Accuracy effect (correct/total attempts)\n\nFull size table\n\nOn measures of reading fluency, OD produced negative results, or decreased\nstudents\u2019 outcomes compared to both Arial and TNR, on all three reading tasks\n(i.e., letter naming, word decoding, nonsense word decoding). ES ranged from\n\u221288.65 %, CI_95 [\u221294.45, \u221277.57] Arial compared to OD on word reading, to\n\u221249.65 %, CI_95 [\u221263.33, \u221232.98] Arial compared to OD on letter naming.\n\nOn measures of reading accuracy, OD also produced negative results, or\ndecreased students\u2019 outcomes compared to both Arial and TNR, on all three\nreading tasks (i.e., letter naming, word decoding, nonsense word decoding). ES\nranged from \u221273.53 %, CI_95 [\u221283.38, \u221259.28] TNR compared to OD on word\nreading, to \u221263.62 %, CI_95 [\u221274.96, \u221248.66] TNR compared to OD on letter\nnaming.\n\nBased on visual and statistical analysis, there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of OD having\na positive effect on reading speed or accuracy.\n\nWhile not the focus of this study, it is interesting to note that there\nappears to be no practically significant difference between the use of TNR and\nArial fonts, even though some have opined a preference for one of the other\n(British Dyslexia Association, n.d).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe development of the OD font may have been developed as the result of a\ncommon misunderstanding of dyslexia. Many new teachers believe dyslexia is\ncaused by a deficit in visual perception (Allington, 1982; Bell, McPhillips, &\nDoveston, 2009; Hudson, High, & Al Otaiba, 2007; Wadlington & Wadlington,\n2005; Washburn, Joshi, & Binks, 2011a, Washburn, Joshi, & Binks-Cantrell,\n2011b; Washburn et al., 2013), which may have originated in a very early use\nof the term \u201cword blindness\u201d (Das & Das, 2009) and perpetuated by the fact\nthat many students with dyslexia have letter reversals. While some with\ndyslexia do report difficulty with vision, there is little evidence to support\nthat this is related to dyslexia (Christenson, Griffin, & Taylor, 2001;\nFletcher, Foorman, Shaywitz, & Shaywitz, 1999). In fact, emerging readers\ncommonly reverse letters as they consolidate and make sense of the sound-\nsymbol system (Adams, 1998).\n\nWith the poor outcomes and personal struggles associated with dyslexia,\nteachers and parents are eager to find interventions to improve reading\noutcomes. Consequently, people in a variety of fields are seeking to help find\nsolutions. However, to truly meet the needs of students who struggle to learn\nto read, they need to be provided interventions that are empirically proven to\nbe effective. Given the press and popular support of using a specialized font\nas a remedy for dyslexia, it is critical to highlight that results from this\nstudy failed to identify any positive effect for using it. Currently, there is\nno documentation to support a specialized font is an evidence-based practice.\nTeachers, administrators, and parents need to be aware of the lack of\nempirical data supporting any positive effects of OD on reading before\naltering all written material into a dyslexia-friendly font. If fact, using a\nfont with claims to improve reading for individuals with dyslexia without\nevidence to support this claim could result in further frustrations by\nteachers, parents, and individuals with dyslexia when no difference is\nobserved after changing fonts used. Teachers and other practitioners need to\nbe able to discriminate between those interventions that have been empirically\nshown to be effective from those that have not. While some may conclude that\nan intervention that fails to produce a positive effect may not do good, but\nprobably does not do harm, others disagree.\n\nInert interventions may in fact cause other forms of harm, in depriving\nresources (time and financial) away from those interventions that have\ndemonstrated efficacy. While the intervention studied here, a freely available\nfont, does not have costs associated with purchasing it, there are financial\nand time cost associated with downloading it and transferring print materials\nto the new font. That time and resource could be use on other interventions\nthat are more likely to improve students\u2019 reading ability. Further, the use of\nunsubstantiated interventions can impact the credibility of the profession,\nand lead to the public losing trust in special educators (Lilienfeld, Lynn, &\nLohr, 2015).\n\nFinally, the most harm may come when students who have already experienced\nsignificant struggle and academic failures related to learning to read, have\nyet another experience with failure when they are not able to read\nsignificantly better in a font designed to do so. A repeated failure\nexperience can further damage students\u2019 self-efficacy and academic self-\nesteem. Instead, students with dyslexia need well-qualified teachers and\ninterventionists, who can skillfully implement intensive instruction (Moats,\n2009). This intensive systematic intervention is likely to include direct\nmultisensory instruction in the areas of phonological awareness, phonics, and\nfluency (Mather & Wendling, 2012; Shaywitz, 2003; Snowling & Hulme, 2012) that\nis both sequential and cumulative, and taught to automaticity (Moats, 2009).\n\n## Limitations and future research\n\nWhile all three reading tasks were selected because of their sensitivity to\nsmall changes, and nonsense word reading was selected because it reduces the\ninfluence of memorization, we did not measure comprehension of connected\ntext\u2014the end goal of reading. However, this study failed to find any positive\neffect of the specialized dyslexia font on the reading accuracy and speed, we\ncan assume it will also have no effect on reading comprehension, this study\ndid not directly measure that variable.\n\nWhile single case research designs are empirical research designs, multiple\nindependent studies with similar results are needed to deem any intervention\nor practice to be \u201cevidence-based\u201d (Kratochwill et al., 2010) Future research\nis needed to verify the results of this study.\n\nWhile OD has not been shown to be an effective intervention for students with\ndyslexia, that is not to say the field should not continue to search for and\ndevelop new and innovative ways to improve outcomes for students. Since\nstudents with dyslexia are already behind their nondisabled peers in regards\nto reading achievement, it become more critical that educators use\ninterventions empirically proven to be effective. Educators cannot waste time\nwith interventions having no empirical support. Our children do not need to\nexperience another failure.\n\n## References\n\n  * Adams, M. (1998).
