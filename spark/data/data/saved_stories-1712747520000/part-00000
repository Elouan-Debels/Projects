In November 2005, the\nUntergunther infiltrated the Pantheon of Paris and, with the help of the\nprofessional clockmaker Jean-Baptiste Viot, started to restore the abandoned\nmonumental 1850 Wagner clock before its irreversible state of defacement. Once\nthis restoration achieved, in October 2006, the Untergunther decided to meet\nBernard Jeannot, the administrator of the Pantheon, in order to show him this\nwork and to connect the clock to the bells. After an enthusiastic welcome,\nMister Jeannot suddenly changed his mind and decided to keep the silence on\nthis clandestine restoration, frightened that this fantastic action was the\nproof of the incapacity of the French National Heritage administration, Monum,\nto preserve the heritage it is in charge of. On the night of the 24th december\n2006, the Untergunther came back to the Pantheon and fixed the bells to the\nclock which just rang for Christmas and a few days after because Mister\nJeannot decided that this result of a clandestine restoration of an abandoned\npart of the French heritage was intolerable and had to stop. Bernard Jeannot\ncan be the administrator of the Pantheon but he does not seem to care about\nheritage. No doubt that a real guerilla is declared between him, its\ninefficient administration and the UnterGunther. This amazing restoration is\nthe end of an adventure began with the clandestine transformation of a\nneglected part of the Pantheon as a design living room with wood furniture\nbuilt onsite, electricity, and a computer connected to internet called the\nUGWK, for \"Unter und Gunther Winter Kneipe\", which could be translated as the\nUnter and Gunther Winter Boozer. A very pleasant workshop which gave also\nnightmares to Mister Jeannot and its so called Administration.On the morning\nof friday November 23 2007, four members of the Untergunther appeared before\nthe Paris Court of Justice, charged not of illegal intrusion and occupation of\na national monument or use of false keys but for having detroyed a keeper of a\nlock located on one of the outside grids of the Pantheon. This charge\n(qualified as \"stupid\" by Public Prosecutor Anne Benejean) being not provable,\nthe indictment was the total release of the UnterGunther members while Eric\nGomez, lawyer for Monum, asked 48300 euros in compensation. After twenty\nminutes of deliberation, Judge Eric Meunier confirmed the release. Pascal\nMonnet, the new Administrator of the Pantheon after the retirement of the\nefficient Bernard Jeannot, and Ghislaine Santoni, in charge of the security of\nthe building, left the Court of Justice with a very sad face and the\nUnterGunther went to their new clandestine workshop to have a\ndrink.Interviewed by French newspaper Le Monde, Monum acknowledged the quality\nof this restoration. One can now wonder why the administration does not decide\nto wind up the clock. It is impossible to think that for all these\nadministrators in charge of the French Heritage a monument is something stated\nin the time and can not be changed, and especially not be upgraded by a\nclandestine restoration....Choice of articles published in English and French\n: Le Parisien (Oct. 14, 2006) : Le Panth\u00e9on habit\u00e9 en secret Le Figaro (Aug.\n31, 2007) : Dans le monde secret des explorateurs urbains The Times (Sep. 29,\n2007) : Underground 'terrorists' with a mission to save city's neglected\nheritage Le Monde (Nov. 25, 2007) : Aux intrus, la patrie... tr\u00e8s \u00e9nerv\u00e9e The\nGuardian (Nov. 26, 2007) : Undercover restorers fix Paris landmark's clock\nWired (January 20, 2012) : The New French Hacker-Artist Underground Science &\nVie Junior (#288, August 2013) : Les fant\u00f4mes du Panth\u00e9onThe 150 year old\nWagner clock and the Untergunther's clockmaker Jean-Baptiste Viot \u00a9 TF1An\nUntergunther repairing the old Wagner clock mecanism \u00a9 UXInside the Wagner\nclock - Before and after the Untergunther restoration \u00a9 TF1The UGWK designed\nand built by the Untergunther in a neglected part of the Pantheon \u00a9\nUXUntergunther's clockmaker Jean-Baptiste Viot \u00a9 UX| Pantheon, user's guide.\nFilm by Lazar Kunstmann.  \n---  \nUrban eXperiment More than 25 years of urban experiment in Paris.  \n---  \n  \nHTML Comment Box is loading comments...  \n---  \n  \nCopyright \u00a9 2002-2018 Urban-Resources All rights reserved\n\n", "frontpage": false}
