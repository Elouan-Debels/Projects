The non-profit\u2019s mission is to ensure a\nplace where open source projects can continue to thrive for future\ngenerations. Commonhaus is prioritizing succession planning, minimal\ngovernance, and financial assistance for its member projects.\n\nThis initiative emerges in response to the dynamic needs of open source\ncommunities seeking foundation frameworks that support growth and transition\nwithout imposed constraints. By focusing on succession planning, Commonhaus\nensures that open source projects can navigate the challenges of leadership\nand contributor changes with ease, maintaining their influence and\nfunctionality across generations of technology evolution.\n\n\u201cThe open source ecosystem has evolved significantly in recent years, with\nexisting foundations laying the groundwork for many successful projects,\u201d said\nErin Schnabel, a Commonhaus Foundation founder and the organization\u2019s\nchairperson. \u201cYet, with the rise of fiscal hosting platforms and self-\ngovernance models on sites like Open Collective and GitHub, there's a clear\nneed for a different approach. Traditional governance models may not align\nwith the needs of projects that have cultivated their own practices and\ninfrastructure. Such projects often find the prospect of merging into existing\nfoundations to be challenging, costly, or unattractive, leaving key needs\nunaddressed. These include the need for a neutral, lasting repository for\ntheir assets and access to funds, especially for those without vendor\nbacking.\u201d\n\nThe Commonhaus Foundation plans to fill this gap to ensure that projects of\nall governance and operational models have the support needed to thrive.\nCommonhaus is dedicated to extending the life and success of projects, filling\na critical need for those that do not fit within the existing frameworks yet\nplay a vital role in the open source community.\n\nTrisha Gee, software engineer, Java Champion and author, stated: \u201cI\u2019m excited\nto hear about Commonhaus, it very nicely fills an important gap in support for\nopen source projects. The focus on community and continuity is crucial for\ntheir success, ensuring sustainability and preventing maintainer burnout. It\u2019s\nnot unusual for these projects to be used in software that has a significant\nimpact on people\u2019s lives around the globe, and it\u2019s important the maintainers\nget the support they need to sustain the project. Open source projects that\nare successful and self-organised shouldn\u2019t have to change their ways of\nworking to have the support of a foundation, and they deserve to rely on a\nfoundation to ensure the longevity of the project. Commonhaus is going to be a\nnew model in sustainable innovation, focused on the power of collective\neffort.\u201d\n\nOpen source projects joining Commonhaus at its launch include Hibernate,\nJackson, OpenRewrite, JBang, JReleaser, and Morphia.\n\nThe foundation is calling on developers, contributors, projects and sponsors\nto join its cause. It promises a future in which open source projects can\ncontinue to grow and serve the global technology community without fear of\nobsolescence.\n\nCommonhaus Foundation membership and support can be initiated through\nsponsorship (GitHub). Becoming a Commonhaus sponsor financially supports the\norganization. It also enables community members to hold foundation offices,\nvote in foundation elections, and influence the strategic direction of\nsustainable development of open source projects.\n\nTo learn more about the Commonhaus Foundation initiatives, visit\nwww.commonhaus.org, follow it on LinkedIn, or contact the organization at\nhello@commonhaus.org.\n\nMembers of the Commonhaus Foundation will be present at several industry\nconferences from April 9-11. Catch Erin Schnabel, Ken Finnigan, Justin Lee,\nOlga Kundzich, and Jonathan Schneider at Devnexus in Atlanta; Andres Almiray\nat JavaLand in N\u00fcrburgring; and Cesar Saavedra at Google Cloud Next in Las\nVegas. They're ready to talk about the foundation's work, field any queries\nyou might have, and explore ways we can work together to advance open source\ndevelopment.\n\n### About Commonhaus Foundation\n\nThe Commonhaus Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to the long-\nterm sustainability of open source projects. By providing a neutral home,\ndeveloper-led governance, and fiscal sponsorship, the foundation ensures that\nessential libraries and frameworks continue to advance, remaining accessible\nfor future generations of developers and businesses across the spectrum.\n\n#### Red Hat, stewards of Hibernate\n\nGavin King, representative for Hibernate, explains the reasoning behind the\nmove to Commonhaus: \u201cHibernate is already ubiquitous in the Java world, and\nhas seen an explosion of activity since the release of version 6. Commonhaus\nFoundation is the \u201cneutral ground\u201d we\u2019ve chosen to continue growing our\ncommunity and to seek closer engagement with other organizations doing\ninteresting things with data. Commonhaus provides support and continuity for\nself-governing projects, making it a perfect host for projects which are\nalready well-run. Red Hat's leadership and sponsorship continue to be a source\nof stability and user confidence, and we now hope to open up more space for\nother groups and companies to feel included in the project.\u201d\n\n#### Moderne, stewards of OpenRewrite\n\nJonathan Schneider, CEO and co-founder of Moderne and creator of the\nOpenRewrite project, expressed support for the foundation: \"Joining Commonhaus\naligns perfectly with the long-term vision and mission of OpenRewrite. Our\nproject is dedicated to delivering automated, open source code migrations,\nupgrades and security fixes swiftly, leveraging the collective effort of the\nentire community. We've always believed that managing dependencies requires a\nbroad coalition; it's a task too vast for any single entity. Moderne is\ncommitted to the principles of pure open source, and we recognize that when an\nentire community\u2014including large enterprises\u2014depends on your projects,\nproviding solid assurances becomes paramount. Commonhaus offers these\nassurances through succession planning beyond a single vendor. It supports our\ncommitment to keep OpenRewrite vibrant, community-driven, and accessible,\nensuring its utility and relevance for years to come.\"\n\n#### JBang\n\nMax Rydahl Andersen, the creator of JBang, shares his insights on joining the\nCommonHaus foundation: \u201cJBang is making Java more accessible, simplifying the\nlearning and experimentation process for both students and professionals. My\njourney with JBang began as a personal project to renew my Java skills, which\nled me to (again) appreciate the vital role of contributors to java libraries\nin keeping the Java ecosystem thriving. While I explored various foundations\nfor JBang, none seemed to align with our vision until Commonhaus. With its\ncommitment to \u2018taking care of the basics\u2019 and allowing 'hands-off project\nexecution', Commonhaus stood out as the ideal home for JBang. I'm excited for\nJBang to be part of this new chapter in Java's adventure, ensuring its\ncontinued growth and impact.\u201d\n\n#### JReleaser\n\nAndres Almiray, creator and current lead of the JReleaser project, says the\nfollowing regarding the foundation: \"JReleaser has steadily grown in\npopularity since its inception back in 2021. The project simplifies and\nautomates releases for all kinds of projects in such a way that consumers are\nonly required to configure what they need, the tool leverages convention over\nconfiguration and sensible defaults to perform its job. We knew it would be\nbeneficial for everyone if the project were to move to a foundation at some\npoint in its lifetime. Commonhaus provides everything the project needs at its\ncurrent state while also offering assurances for its future. The timing to\njoin Commonhaus couldn't be better as JReleaser will celebrate one more\nanniversary of its first release by the time the foundation is officially\nlaunched\".\n\n#### Jackson\n\nTatu Saloranta, the creator and project lead of Jackson, expresses his\nenthusiasm for joining the Commonhaus Foundation: \"While Jackson components\nare widely used within the Java software ecosystem, our core project team\nremains compact, and our processes minimal. Over the years, we have\noccasionally considered the desirability and feasibility of affiliating with\nwell-known open source foundations. However, none seemed to quite align with\nthe preferences of our project and team. After observing the formation of the\nCommonhaus Foundation, we are confident that we have found our future home.\nThe foundation's goals align closely with ours, and it emphasizes enabling\nindividual projects to maintain focus on their core competency: the\ndevelopment of high-quality open source software.\"\n\n#### Morphia\n\nJustin Lee, the creator of Morphia, adds the following: \"Morphia has had a\nlong, complicated history leading to its current situation. Like other\nprojects, various foundations and communal \u201chomes\u201d have been considered but\nnone have really felt like a great fit. Commonhaus\u2019s goals align with\nMorphia\u2019s for a long-term stable home that isn\u2019t dependent on one person or\ncorporate entity. By securing a long-term home and lightweight guidance in\ngovernance for the project, we can focus more on the project itself rather\nthan the logistics surrounding its maintenance. By joining the Commonhaus\nFoundation, we can begin to build and share common infrastructure with our\nhausmates and make life better for all of us.\"\n\nebullient\n\nupdated 9 April 2024\n\nposted 29 March 2024\n\nJoin the conversation\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Commonhaus Foundation.
