After much reflection, I made the decision to complete the development\nof PixelExperience.\n\nThe project was created by me in 2017, in a completely different scenario from\nwhat we live in today. Today, after almost 6 years, I made the difficult\ndecision to end development.\n\nThis project has been an incredible journey filled with innovation,\ncollaboration, and unwavering dedication from both the team and the community.\nFrom the inception of PixelExperience, our goal has always been to provide\nusers with a seamless, customizable, and feature-rich Android experience,\ntailored to a wide array of devices.\n\nAs we bid farewell to active development, I want to express my deepest\nappreciation to every member of our community, testers, contributors, and all\nsupporters. Your passion and commitment have been the driving force behind\nevery milestone we've achieved.\n\nPixelExperience website will remain available. This means you will still have\naccess to download older builds.\n\nThank you for being a part of this remarkable journey.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\njhenrique09 Owner, PixelExperience Project\n\n#### Jos\u00e9 Henrique\n\nPixelExperience founder\n\nPixelExperience Blog \u00a9 2024\n\nPowered by Ghost\n\n", "frontpage": false}
