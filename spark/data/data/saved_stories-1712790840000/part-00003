At the time I was an undergrad at the\nUniversity of Leeds, halfway through a year abroad at UCLA. If you\u2019ve never\nmade a similar move, you can\u2019t possibly imagine what it was like to be thrust\nsuddenly out of the damp armpit of West Yorkshire and into the California sun.\nI was twenty-one years old and I had just discovered that happiness was\npossible. It was in California that I stopped smoking weed for good, even\nthough it was basically legal and definitely everywhere: I knew I only had a\nfew months until the world would spin again and dislodge me back in the land\nof dry stone walls, lukewarm ale, and the grey, all-enclosing gloom of three\no\u2019clock in the afternoon. I did not want to waste those months getting high\nand watching cartoons. I wanted to drink the desert while I still could.\nPlunge into the black hole nowhereness of this sprawling evil city. I started\nlifting weights. I did all my reading shirtless on the beach. I also started\ngetting really into cocaine.\n\nAnother thing I did was join the Daily Bruin, UCLA\u2019s venerable student\nnewspaper. This was on the understanding that if I wanted to be a writer some\nday, I\u2019d have to start out doing actual journalism, interviewing boring\nuniversity officials or equally boring students for stories I didn\u2019t really\ncare about. (\u2018Campus Parking Fee Hike Draws Ire.\u2019) Back then, it still wasn\u2019t\nclear just how much the media had already changed. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s improved,\nand maybe the situation would be improved if you did have to put in your hours\non piddling parking-fee-hike bullshit before you could blather about art or\npolitics or whatever for the rest of your life, but I quickly worked out that\nthis was no longer the case. Before I dropped out, though, one of the editors\ngoggled in amazement at the phone I\u2019d brought over from the UK, which had\ntwelve numbered buttons and could make calls and send text messages. What was\nI, he asked, some kind of chimney sweep? Not that you needed a smartphone to\ndo journalism, but everyone else had one now, and therefore so did I. So I got\none. And then afterwards, I was stuck with it. This machine was full of\npossibility, but I still wasn\u2019t sure exactly what it could do. Live navigation\nwould be good; at the time I was getting around LA by writing myself little\nnotes with the numbers of different bus lines on them, and since the city\nseemed to be underserved by twelve different transport providers at once\u2014all\nof which, it turned out, mostly catered to violent maniacs\u2014I was constantly\ngetting lost in various neighbourhoods that all looked exactly the same. What\nelse? Well, you could download apps. So I downloaded an app called Fruit\nNinja, a game in which you cut imaginary fruit in half. It was strangely\ncompulsive. You just swipe your finger, and look, the melon slices open like\nmagic. The world in the phone is so intuitive. It always does exactly what you\nwant. The upshot was that I spent a portion of every single one of my\nremaining days in California on my own, indoors, cutting imaginary fruit in\nhalf.\n\nI stopped playing Fruit Ninja, eventually. But for nearly fourteen years\nafterwards, I stared at a smartphone every single day. Five thousand days, all\nin all. I can\u2019t think of anything else I\u2019ve done with the same level of\ncommitment. There have been days where I\u2019ve had nothing to eat or drink and\nthere have been nights when I didn\u2019t sleep. But until very recently, I never\nonce went twenty-four hours without remembering to look at my phone.\n\nIn 2012, a lot of people were very enthusiastic about the phones. Why wouldn\u2019t\nthey be? We\u2019d finally been liberated from boredom. We\u2019d abolished distance. On\nthose late-night buses in LA, I sometimes saw women on their way to the\nmorning shift, who\u2019d hold up their phones and coo in Spanish to babies that\nmight have been gurgling thousands of miles away. There are no barriers any\nmore. Everything is everywhere. Some people thought the phones might help\nspark the big political shift that would finally free us all. People could\norganise independently, share knowledge, form communities, connect with each\nother across every possible social divide. The phones were showing us the\nsocial form of the future: a spontaneous, self-regulating, non-hierarchical\nnetwork, gently swaddling us all in a billion strands of information and\nlight. Or you could just marvel at how much of everything is available now.\nAll of human culture, infinitely accessible. You can read any book. You can\nhave any artwork you want, anywhere in the world, in the palm of your hand.\nWhich is, of course, exactly what we ended up doing with the phones. We used\nthem to look at art.\n\nMaybe there are still a few of those enthusiasts out there. Scuttling under\nrocks or in the loam, pale and soft like hermit crabs. Creatures that aren\u2019t\ncomplete without a bit of plastic to hide under, whose antennas still twitch\ngreedily when they release the specs for every new iteration of the iPhone.\nApple\u2019s marketing department seems to think so; they\u2019ve even discovered a new\nemotion, \u2018newphoria,\u2019 which is the sensation one of these creatures\nexperiences when they replace their old phone with the latest model. But it\u2019s\nhard to imagine them surviving long. Now, we know that newphoria is the\nexcitement of a prey animal being hunted by a bold, fresh, thrilling new\npredator. Now, almost everyone accepts that the phones are bad.\n\nThis is not a new idea. But a decade ago, phones bad was still a basically\naesthetic impression. It felt weird to see so many people uniformly fascinated\nby dark rectangles. It felt ugly to be out in public, on the train, in the\npark, and notice that absolutely everyone was staring silently at their\nphones. Maybe every technology arrives ugly. The new always comes shrouded in\nthe sense that old ways were much better, simply by virtue of being old. So\nfor a while, you could plausibly dismiss the people who didn\u2019t like the\nphones. People have always resisted change; that\u2019s the one thing that never\nchanges.\n\nIt works the other way too, though. For several centuries now, people have\ndefended new things by pointing out how uniformly people have rejected new\nthings. But sometimes a new gadget is not actually good. Maybe radium\ntoothpaste is not just the fast way to a winning smile. And over the last few\nyears, we\u2019ve seen what this particular new thing has done to the kids.\n\nWe thought we were just having fun times with devices; it turns out we were\nspreading nuclear waste over the entire surface of the earth. Piling up heaps\nof radioactive slag inside our homes. Smearing it over our faces at night. And\nthen a generation was born into that poisoned world; we got to watch them take\nshape, and it became obvious how broken they are, how we had broken them. The\nkids can\u2019t read. They can sound out the letters and recognise words, but they\nfind it impossible to sit in one place and ingest a single extended linear\npiece of prose for more than five minutes. The kids don\u2019t go outside. They\ndon\u2019t feel the sun on their skins. They spend whole summers locked in their\nrooms, alone, experiencing the world through five and a half inches of glass.\nThe kids don\u2019t fuck. They identify with various modes of sexuality based on\nthe kind of images of themselves they\u2019d like to maintain, but none of it has\nanything to do with feeling the warmth of another person\u2019s skin on your own.\nSome of them want to have sex with cartoon characters. The kids are\ndesperately unhappy. They do not like the lives we have given them. A lot of\nthem would like to live differently. But they can\u2019t stop looking at their\nphones.\n\nIt\u2019s strange, though: even though we know the phones have poisoned everything,\nwe still keep using the phones. All the sharpest critics of digital technology\nand its effects on the human psyche are also constantly looking at their own\nglowing rectangles. I know people who\u2019ve written books on the subject, but\nI\u2019ve no idea how they found the time, what with the staring and flicking and\nscrolling that seems to constitute their entire lives. Maybe this is as it\nshould be. In the face of the vastness of this catastrophe, trying to limit\nyour own personal screen time feels a bit weak. A copout. It\u2019s not very\nsystemic, is it? Not a solution, more like a refusal to actually grapple with\nthe scale of the problem. Run to your little walled garden, stick your fingers\nin your ears. The phones are bad, they\u2019re apocalyptically bad, but can you\neven understand the world if you\u2019re not constantly on your phone?\n\nI am not a Christian, but my girlfriend is. And since she\u2019s agreed to spend\neight days a year commemorating an exodus that never actually happened, and to\ndo so by forsaking basically all carbs except potatoes and one particular\nvariety of dry cracker, I\u2019ve agreed to join her every year in observing Lent.\nLast time, she gave up her morning coffee. I don\u2019t drink coffee, so that one\nwas pretty easy. This year, she decided to go forty days without her phone.\nHer average daily screen time was one hour and twenty minutes, and she was\nworried that she was spending too much time looking at crap on Instagram\ninstead of reading books. Meanwhile, I\u2019m a persistent critic of digital\ntechnology and its social consequences. I keep on writing about how bad this\nstuff is, sometimes in some of the most prestigious publications in the world.\nWhich is to say that my daily screen time was much, much more than hers.\n\nMy five-thousand-day streak of looking at a smartphone ended on the 14th of\nFebruary, 2024. My new phone was a TCL Onetouch 4021, which looks like this:\n\nThe Onetouch costs \u00a317.99 from Argos. It can make phone calls and send text\nmessages. Beyond that its capacities are limited. It has an alarm clock but no\ntimer. There\u2019s a calendar, but you can\u2019t add any of your engagements. It does\nhave a full colour screen and even a camera on the back, but its built-in\nmemory of 4MB is just enough for four photos, or one fourteen-second voice\nmemo. You can insert an SD card if you want. You can also use two SIM cards at\nthe same time, although it turned out that neither of our SIMs actually fit in\nthe thing. We had to walk to a Vodafone shop to see if they had any nano-to-\nmicro SIM adapters, which they did, in the back of a drawer nobody had even\ntried to open for most of a decade. There was some kind of procedure for\nselling them to us, but none of the staff were sure how it worked, so in the\nend they just gave them to us for free. Good luck with the drug dealing, they\nsaid.\n\nThis year, the beginning of Lent coincided with Valentine\u2019s Day. Valentine\u2019s\nis, of course, an instrument for transforming the singularity of romantic love\ninto a predictable annual stimulus for the wood-pulp industry. But because I\u2019m\nin love, I took my girlfriend out for a \u00a3200 meal at the Quality Chop House on\nFarringdon Road in London. (Actually, I suppose the meal was paid for by forty\nof my monthly subscribers. Remember that when you sign up as a paying\nsubscriber to Numb at the Lodge, every penny goes towards hard-hitting\njournalism like this.) She got the leg of lamb; I got the pork collar. The\npork was tender and bouncy and crowned with a ridge of gorgeous crunchy fat,\nbut some of the best eating came from the starters and sides. The doughnuts\nwith cod\u2019s roe didn\u2019t provide the usual fussy dots of food you get from fine\ndining restaurants, but a proper thick smear of pungent smoky taramasalata,\nlifted by the vinegary zip of the doughnuts. Maybe the best things we ate were\nthe famous confit potatoes: slabs of a hundred thinly sliced layers cooked in\nduck fat until the insides were buttery soft and the outsides were crispy and\nserrated enough to cut through a loaf of bread. Anyway, I don\u2019t really need to\nkeep up this Jay Rayner impression, because I can show you. Out of sheer\nhabit, I took a photo on my phone. Here it is.\n\nPhotographing my food is probably my worst habit, but I\u2019m not alone. Every\ntime I go out somewhere nice, I see the ritual: nothing arrives on anyone\u2019s\ntable without a good minute-long photoshoot. We can\u2019t eat our food without\nimmortalising it first. I can make excuses: I\u2019m interested in food, I cook a\nlot, I\u2019m learning, which is why it\u2019s fine when I do it. Lies. Meanwhile, every\narticle on the phenomenon online seems to cite the same bogus study in the\nJournal Of Consumer Marketing about how Instagramming your meal actually makes\nit taste better. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not that either. Over the course of my\nforty days without a phone, I noticed a stab of anxiety every time I ate\nsomething without being able to snap a picture first. Clearly, it wasn\u2019t just\nthat food looks nice; these photos were supplying some hidden need. They\u2019re\nbound up with pain and fear. This neurotic tic that everyone has but no one\nwill name, that came into being as soon as we all got our phones.\n\nI think it has something to do with the temporally bound experience of food.\nEating a really good meal might be the most enjoyable thing you can do in\npublic, but it\u2019s also an act of destruction. You are taking something\nbeautiful and reducing it to nothing. The enjoyment lasts for only a few short\nminutes; when it\u2019s done it doesn\u2019t leave a single trace. Not even memories,\nnot really. You can remember things you\u2019ve done or places you\u2019ve been, but you\ncan never really conjure the taste of a meal you ate months or years ago. It\u2019s\nall locked away in a particular moment. A vanishing, mayfly version of\nyourself that evaporates almost as soon as it appears. This fixation in time\ndoes mean that smelling or tasting something familiar can catapult you into a\nProustian re-experience of the past, in a way that sights or sounds can\u2019t. (I\nrecently caught a whiff of the same brand of cheap American air freshener I\u2019d\nused in LA, and suddenly everything collapsed into place: the white-hot sun,\nthe sea without swimmers, the demonic sprawl; for an instant I was twenty-one\nagain and horny and the world was about to be mine.) But fundamentally, when\nyou pay \u00a3200 for a fancy meal, all you\u2019re shelling out for is tomorrow\u2019s\nturds.\n\nUntil yesterday, people had to accept that sensory pleasures carry a gloomy\nintimation of death. Keats understood this perfectly:\n\n    \n    \n    She dwells with Beauty\u2014Beauty that must die; And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh, Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips: Ay, in the very temple of Delight Veil\u2019d Melancholy has her sovran shrine...\n\nBut we don\u2019t have to understand this if we don\u2019t want to, not any more. Before\nthe advent of the smartphone, it was impossible for anyone to record every\nsingle meal they ate; now, it\u2019s the norm. I take photos of my food to make\nthis transitory moment last forever. A record of what has been destroyed; a\nmonument. Somewhere inside my phone, the passage of time has been stalled. But\nI never look at these photos. They have no relation to the visual functions of\npre-phone photography; their purpose is simply to exist. Every second,\nmillions of people are taking millions of these useless photos of food, photos\nthat don\u2019t represent their object but help you ignore something else. It could\nbe worse. At least with food you do still eat the thing afterwards. Next time\nyou go to a concert, though\u2014or a sports game, or whatever\u2014notice what everyone\nelse is doing. They don\u2019t want this moment to vanish, so they film it on their\nphones, even though they know that they\u2019ll never watch the footage again.\nThey\u2019re watching it this time, though. They\u2019re watching the entire performance\nthrough their screens.\n\nI don't want to give the impression that giving up my smartphone radically\ntransformed my life. There were some weird new sensations sometimes, and\nothers I\u2019d almost forgotten, but actually, what was most striking was how\nlittle actually changed. I told my friends that it was better to get me on SMS\ninstead of WhatsApp, and they all WhatsApped me anyway. This meant that\ninstead of ambiently communicating with people all day long on my phone, I was\nintensively communicating with them for about thirty minutes on my laptop. The\npractical difference, in terms of making plans and so on, was about nil.\nThings are rarely all that urgent.\n\nNot having a smartphone is entirely practical. You do not need it. This\nmachine barely does anything at all.\n\nThere is one function that\u2019s genuinely useful. Having a live, searchable GPS\nhas some very real benefits; before I bought my first smartphone, I could\nimagine how it would improve my life. (Are people who\u2019ve never had the pleasue\nexcited by the prospect of scrolling through TikToks?) Last year, I could\narrive in the middle of some smogbound provincial city in Henan province,\nChina, and instantly find my way around. That was nice. The prospect of\nsuddenly losing that power came with some anxiety. My girlfriend had a dream\nin which her train broke down and she was stranded in the middle of nowhere.\nShe couldn\u2019t even get a cab, because there weren\u2019t any taxi companies saved in\nher stupid new phone. All she had was an address, which was carved in a stick\nof butter. As she tried to show it to people, it slowly melted in her hands.\n\nIn the waking world, though, nothing like this ever happened to her. Instead,\nit happened to me. Shortly after getting my Onetouch, I had to walk down to\nthe Japan Centre near Piccadilly Circus to stock up on my kombu and umeboshi\nand other froufrou bullshit, and it was only once I was at the curly end of\nRegent\u2019s Street that I realised I didn\u2019t actually know where the Japan Centre\nwas. Somewhere around here\u2014but where? I confidently strode down one wrong\nstreet after another, doubled back, failed again. Eventually I found myself in\nthe tangle of alleys around St James\u2019s and realised to my horror that I was\u2014in\nthe middle of my own city, in the tourist heart of London, in a place with\nmore world-famous landmarks per square kilometre than anywhere else on the\nplanet\u2014lost. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d been lost. People don\u2019t get\nlost any more. It\u2019s one of those charming old experiences, like looking\nsomething up in a big encyclopaedia, or dying of polio, that\u2019s been made\nobsolete by the forward march of technology. Not so long ago, hack comedians\nused to talk about the small rituals you have to perform when you realise\nyou\u2019ve walked the wrong way. You can\u2019t just turn around; that\u2019s maniac\nbehaviour. You have to pat your pockets or make an exasperated tutting sound;\nthat way people will know that you\u2019re turning around because you\u2019ve forgotten\nsomething, which is a far less embarrassing mental lapse than managing to get\nyourself lost. I don\u2019t think anyone does that any more, because we\u2019ve stopped\nwalking the wrong way. We are all always on the most efficient possible path\nbetween two points.\n\nWeirdly, I didn\u2019t mind being utterly lost less than three miles from my own\nfront door. It was very slightly thrilling. With the phone, navigating the\ncity becomes a kind of augmented reality game, in which you move your legs and\navoid various obstacles to direct a blue marble along a dotted line onscreen.\nNow all my directions had to come from the city itself. Did this turning look\nlike the right one? Did it feel like it might take me home? Being lost means\npaying intense attention to the texture, the Erfahrung, of where you are,\nwhile having only the haziest sense of its location relative to other places.\nNavigating via phone is the opposite: you know exactly where you are, but it\u2019s\nnot really anywhere in particular. You sink into a kind of abstract mental\ntunnel until you reach where you\u2019re going. A new, inverted form of being lost.\n\nIt is possible to know your surroundings well enough that you don\u2019t get lost.\nThis is what most people have done for most of human history. Horse nomads can\ntraverse a hundred miles of featureless steppe without ever wondering where\nthe fuck they actually are. New Guinean highlanders can effortlessly find a\nsingle fruit tree in the dense and trackless woods. London cabbies famously\nmemorise the layout of the entire city. Once, this made them extremely\nreliable; now, all that specialised local knowledge gets you to the exact same\nplace as an Uber-driving immigrant. But Uber drivers have described entering a\nstrange trancelike state while at work. You drive all night in a kind of\ndream; afterwards you can\u2019t even remember where you\u2019ve been, who you picked\nup, where you dropped them off. You just turn left when the voice tells you\nto. Human consciousness as a brief, lossy interface between the navigation app\nand the steering wheel.\n\nThere are ways of uniting abstract relational geography with the concrete\nexperience of being in a particular place. Song lines, ley lines, mystical\nstructures that turn the physical landscape into a piece of narrative. But the\nsimplest way of doing this is to make a map. I think the most beautiful maps\never made are the stick charts made by the seafaring aristocracy of the\nMarshall Islands, which don\u2019t represent solid objects, since there are no\nsolid objects in the endless sea, but track the zones of ocean swells. These\nswells are produced by the position of landmasses and the churning of\ntransoceanic weather systems, but ultimately they\u2019re governed by the action of\nthe Earth\u2019s gravity on the boundary between sea and sky. Stick charts map the\nentire world, from the atmosphere down to the planetary core. They look like\nwhat they are: abstract, fantastically intricate computers made from cowrie\nshells and coconut fronds, interoperable with the universe in general.\n(There\u2019s one at the top of this post.) My own maps were much less ambitious. I\nmust have made dozens of them. Here\u2019s one:\n\nI\u2019m not sure why, but everyone who saw these maps found them hilarious. As if\nthey hadn\u2019t used them too. We\u2019re not so young. We all printed them off\nMapQuest, once upon a time. We scribbled them on the backs of receipts. We\nwent on holiday to foreign cities with just a few lines on paper to guide us.\nWe managed. It is actually completely possible to get around without a phone.\n\nThere were, admittedly, a few incidents in which I had to break my fast and\nbriefly turn my phone back on. Most of these involved two-factor\nauthentication, and I\u2019m pretty sure they could have been avoided if I\u2019d\nplanned ahead a bit better. I turned the phone on to go for a run, but I could\neasy replace it with a FitBit and an antique iPod. The other incidents were\nall down to something called Gusto, a payroll service that half the\npublications I write for seem to have adopted at the same time. I quite badly\nneeded the money they owed me, but to get it I had to sign up for Gusto on my\nphone, upload my ID, and then perform a bunch of humiliating facial\ncontortions for my front-facing camera so the biometric software could be\ncertain that I was actually myself, and not someone deviously impersonating a\nfreelance writer to get their greedy hands on the vast, vast riches we accrue.\nI did this several times, and each attempt ended with an error message telling\nme that my passport and biometric information were incorrect and didn\u2019t match\nthe data in their system. Apparently my face was wrong. But if they already\nhad all my data in their system, why was I going through this whole stupid\nprocess in the first place? In the end I just emailed my various editors\nasking if they could send me the money without involving Gusto at all. It\nturned out they could. That was all it took.\n\nObviously my job gives me a lot more latitude than most people\u2019s, but I still\nsuspect that if you think you need your phone for work, you\u2019re probably wrong.\nYou do not need to be writing emails on the move. If you have to write emails,\ndo it when you get home. When I was a child, I had a plastic folder full of\nWikipedia articles I\u2019d printed out to read on the bus. This is also possible.1\nTechnologically, there\u2019s nothing your phone can do that an ordinary computer\ncan\u2019t. These machines haven\u2019t changed the world because they have any very\nnotable capabilities. They just have the right shape for latching onto the\nsoft part underneath your mind.\n\nWhat everyone really wanted to know about giving up my phone was whether it\nhad miraculously increased my attention span, and whether I was getting any\nmore reading done. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure. In the six weeks of Lent I read\nten books, which is decent going but not really exceptional, even if some of\nthem were quite long.2 But reading did feel easier. Usually, whenever I sit\ndown with anything more demanding than your average Sunday Times bestseller, I\ninstantly start hearing the voice of a scratchy little demon, scratching away\nat the inside of my skull. Look at your phone, it says. Stop reading and look\nat your phone. Look at your phone this instant. Something might have happened\non your phone. The book will stay the same forever but there might be\nsomething new on your phone. You might have notifications. You might have some\nof those red circles you crave so much. You can just put the book down for a\nmoment. One quick moment to look at your phone. Don\u2019t you know who I am? My\nname is Astaroth and in the Ars Goetica or Lesser Key of Solomon I am a\nmighty, strong Duke of Hell commanding forty demonic legions. I can show you\nfulfilment beyond your knowing if you choose to follow me, but first you must\nLOOK AT YOUR PHONE.\n\nSometimes I managed to resist Astaroth. But he was always there, and if I gave\nin to his temptations for even a moment, suddenly it was already dark, the day\nwas gone, and I had absolutely no memory of what I\u2019d been scrolling through\nfor the last three hours. I suppose I was looking at whatever I wanted to look\nat in that particular moment. Huge complex machines exist purely to show me\nmore of the kind of things I like. Strange how all this fulfilment never seems\nto leave you feeling good. Strange how indulging all your idlest urges feels\nlike you\u2019ve mortgaged a portion of your life to Hell. Anyway, I expected\nAstaroth to stick around for a while after I got rid of the phone, like a\nnicotine craving. But he didn\u2019t. As soon as checking my phone was no longer an\noption, the desire to do so simply vanished.\n\nOr it did, as long as I was doing something else. I could read. But in every\nidle instant, Astaroth reigned. Every time I met someone at a pub, there\u2019d be\na nightmare moment when my friend\u2019s round came and he went up to the bar,\nleaving me alone at a table with forty demonic legions all commanding me to\nlook at the phone I didn\u2019t have. The horror of simply existing, sitting alone\nwith nothing to look at, nothing to do with my hands, no bright lights to\nbriefly flood my brain. Once, in desperation, I started clicking through the\nUK Radio Equipment Regulations compliance statement buried in an obscure sub-\nmenu on my Onetouch, until my friend returned with my pint. That same itch\nwould come whenever I was waiting for someone outside a venue or a Tube\nstation, or when I found myself on public transport without a book or a\nnewspaper, or when I was watching a film with my girlfriend and she paused to\nuse the loo. Instantly, fingers started twitching to go on my phone. This\nwasn\u2019t simple boredom; it had all the restless tachycardia of an anxiety. It\nis awful to exist in these in-between moments. When you\u2019re doing nothing\nexcept existing, when your only available object is your own existence, when\nyou\u2019re facing the full demonic inconceivability of being here, in the world,\nthrown into awareness of your own being for a reason you will never know, or\npossibly no reason at all. Nobody wants to think about that shit. So you look\nat your phone.\n\nI\u2019m told that smoking has declined basically in tandem with the rise of the\nsmartphone. This makes sense. They\u2019re both something to do with your hands in\nthe empty moments, before or afterwards, when you\u2019re waiting for something\nelse to happen. Both of them will also kill you.\n\nOnce, I was in Chicago for an afternoon with nothing to do, so I decided to be\na tourist and go up the viewing gallery at the top of one of the skyscrapers.\nI shared a lift with a dad and his three preteen boys, who spent the ride\npunching each other in the ribs. When the doors opened, the vast flat expanse\nof the American midwest was laid out in front of us, falling into the equally\nvast flatness of Lake Michigan. We were almost level with the clouds, and as\nthe setting sun burst through them the fingers of God gently stroked this\nworld he had made. But the observation deck also had some big touchscreen\ndisplays that let you zoom in on the view to identify the various landmarks.\nInstantly, the boys pelted for the screen and started tapping and swiping at\nthe image of what was right outside the windows. Their poor dad was left\nwailing. He had brought his sons here to show them something beautiful, and\nthey couldn\u2019t even be bothered to give it a perfunctory glance. \u2018It\u2019s there!\u2019\nhe kept saying. \u2018It\u2019s right there!\u2019\n\nTo live is to live in the world. What we do on the screens is something else.\n\nAfter a while without my phone, I started to really notice how much everyone\nelse was staring at theirs. On public transport in particular. Every adult is\nsitting there, pushing around coloured squares and popping coloured bubbles.\nThey are playing with toys for babies. Now look at their faces. These people\nare not being entertained. They\u2019re not having fun. They are turning their\nbrains off while they wait.\n\nNot using a phone taught me what a phone is really for. It\u2019s not for\ncommunicating with other people, getting directions, reading articles, looking\nat pictures, shopping for products, or playing games. A phone is a device for\nmuting the anxieties proper to being alive. This is what all its functions and\nfeatures ultimately achieve: cameras deliver you from time, GPS abstracts you\nout of space, and an all-consuming screen that keeps you a constant safe\ndistance from yourself. If there\u2019s something you\u2019re worried or upset about,\nyou can simply hide behind your phone and it will all go away. One third of\nadults say they\u2019re on their phones almost constantly. Their entire waking\nlives are spent filling time, plastering over the gaps, burning up one day\nafter another, waiting for something to happen, and it never does.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to dismiss the anxieties proper to being alive. These are\nserious anxieties, and I\u2019m not sure they have any easy solution. Maybe the\nphone is a perfectly workable answer: to keep deferring the problem, one day\nto the next, until eventually it goes away for other reasons. Spending forty\ndays without my phone did not make me magically happier. I wasn\u2019t awed by the\nsunrise every morning. I didn\u2019t suddenly find that all my relationships were\nso much deeper and richer. I did find myself ambiently uncomfortable in\nsituations that had previously been helpfully smoothed over by a glowing\nscreen. I got bored. I got lost. But I did also get more reading done, and my\ndays did feel like they had more things in them. Since I\u2019ve started using the\nphone again, my weekly screen time\u2019s down to a fraction of where it was\nbefore. It\u2019s weirdly hard to go back. The phone can have my attention, but\nit\u2019s incapable of maintaining my interest. Perfect things are not that\ninteresting, and the phone is smooth and flat and flawless, while the\nalternative has some very prominent design problems extending to basically\nevery area. Reality is not intuitive or instantly responsive to all my\nfleeting whims. It does not immediately yield whatever I want. Most of the\ntime it seems to barely recognise my existence. This might be better for you\nin the long run; on an immediate level it\u2019s very frustrating. But for better\nor worse we have been condemned to live. All we have is what\u2019s right here; the\nonly thing that ever is or ever will be here.\n\nPlease sign up to read more posts like this on your phone\n\n1\n\nRight now, you are\u2014statistically speaking\u2014reading this on a smartphone. It\u2019s\nnot really in my best interests to say this, but you should probably stop. If\nyou want to read something, read it on paper. Print it out! Take it to the\npark and read it there! And if it isn\u2019t worth the effort, then why are you\nreading it at all?\n\n2\n\nIf you\u2019re interested: I read Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, in David Raeburn\u2019s\ntranslation for Penguin Classics, which I found a bit disappointing; it was\nvery readable, but the verse just felt like prose with line breaks, and in\ntrying to avoid the stuffiness of academic Latin it ended up being a little\nplain. But I also read Virgil\u2019s Georgics in LP Wilkinson\u2019s translation, also\nfor Penguin Classics, and it\u2019s gorgeous. Listen:\n\n    \n    \n    Never did lightnings flash more frequently From a clear sky, never so often blazed Dire comets. So it was that a second time Philippi saw the clash of Roman arms With Roman arms, nor did it irk the gods That twice Emathis and broad Haemus\u2019 plains Should batten on our blood. Surely a time will come when in those regions The farmer heaving the soil with his curved plough Will come on spears all eaten up with rust Or strike with his heavy hoe on hollow helmets And gape at the huge bones in the upturned graves.\n\nI read The Green Man by Kingsley Amis, which has some moments but isn\u2019t really\nhis best. I read EE Evans-Pritchard\u2019s Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the\nAzande, which I intend to write about a lot more later. I\u2019d already come\nacross the title essay and \u2018Notes on Camp,\u2019 but I read the rest of Sontag\u2019s\nAgainst Interpretation. (Incredible that the role of the serious American\nintellectual was once to inform her readers what was coming out of Europe. Now\nthere\u2019s nothing coming out of Europe, and the type of American who used to\npreen over Godard and Gide now just congratulates themselves for watching\nprestige TV.) Because Sontag kept dropping his name, I finally read Man\u2019s Fate\nby Andr\u00e9 Malraux, which did make me consider how much more afraid of death I\nam now I\u2019ve cooled on the prospects for Communist revolution. Although after\nthat, because I\u2019d read a review in the LRB and it seemed interesting, I read\nThe Siege of Loyalty House: A New History of the English Civil War by Jessie\nChilds, which was very human and evocative but did leave me wishing for a\nbunch of tables showing grain prices and real wages over the course of the\nwar, so maybe I am still a good Marxist after all. A reader told me that my\npiece on truly foreign languages reminded him of China Mi\u00e9ville\u2019s Embassytown,\nso I reread it to discover that yes, my thing really is identical, although\nthat\u2019s probably just because we\u2019re both adapting the same Walter Benjamin\nessay. I read Palestine+100, a collection of science fiction stories by\nPalestinians, mostly in the diaspora, of which many were interesting, although\nonly one, \u2018The Curse of the Mud Ball Kid\u2019 by Mazen Maarouf, was actually\nmeaningfully good. Finally, it occurred to me that I\u2019d never actually read The\nBrothers Karamazov; the person who read it was some dumb kid who happened to\nshare my name. So I read it again. Dostoevsky is a great writer, but maybe not\na good one. His books sag with blather: page after page of drunks rambling,\nmatrons shrieking, people turning purple. And then he\u2019ll very lightly season\nthis overwrought, hysterical Victorian nonsense with some of the most\ndevastating moral observations ever put to the page. A friend told me that\nwhenever she tried reading him she always felt like she\u2019d got the wrong\ntranslation, but maybe she actually just fucking hated Dostoevsky. I don\u2019t\nknow if I agree. But I do understand why.\n\n### Subscribe to Numb at the Lodge\n\nBy Sam Kriss \u00b7 Thousands of paid subscribers\n\nThese heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here\n\nShare\n\nThe internet is already over\n\nOur God is a devourer, who makes things only for the swallowing.\n\nSep 18, 2022 \u2022\n\nSam Kriss\n\nTaylor Swift does not exist\n\nA letter from within a letter and a name from within the names and gaps from\nwithin the revealed\n\nNov 28, 2023 \u2022\n\nSam Kriss\n\nAll the nerds are dead\n\nHow Andy Warhol invented nerd culture; why it's imploding\n\nApr 9, 2023 \u2022\n\nSam Kriss\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Sam Kriss\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n", "frontpage": false}
