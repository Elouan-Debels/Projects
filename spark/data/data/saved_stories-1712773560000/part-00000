In Tor: From the Dark Web to the Future of Privacy, Ben Collier\nhas written, in essence, a biography of Tor\u2014a cultural and technological\nhistory of power, privacy, politics, and empire in the deepest reaches of the\ninternet.\n\nThe story of Tor begins in the 1990s with its creation by the US Navy's Naval\nResearch Lab, from a convergence of different cultural worlds. Drawing on in-\ndepth interviews with designers, developers, activists, and users, along with\ntwenty years of mailing lists, design documents, reporting, and legal papers,\nCollier traces Tor's evolution from those early days to its current operation\non the frontlines of global digital power\u2014including the strange collaboration\nbetween US military scientists and a group of freewheeling hackers called the\nCypherpunks. As Collier charts the rise and fall of three different cultures\nin Tor's diverse community\u2014the engineers, the maintainers, and the activists,\neach with a distinct understanding of and vision for Tor\u2014he reckons with Tor's\ncomplicated, changing relationship with contemporary US empire. Ultimately,\nthe book reveals how different groups of users have repurposed Tor and built\nnew technologies and worlds of their own around it, with profound implications\nfor the future of the Internet.\n\n## Author(s)\n\nBen Collier is Lecturer in Digital Methods in the Department of Science,\nTechnology, and Innovation Studies at the School of Social and Political\nScience, University of Edinburgh.\n\n## Praise\n\n> \u201cIn this engaging treatment of a complex history, Collier makes a\n> significant contribution to the critical discourse on privacy in the United\n> States.\u201d\n>\n> Bruce Schneier, author of A Hacker's Mind: How the Powerful Bend Society's\n> Rules, and How to Bend Them Back\n\n> \u201cBen Collier's Tor provides a concise history of an essential tool in the\n> surveillance-fighting arsenal and the characters that made it so, while\n> providing readers with a vivid sense of the zeitgeist in which Tor and its\n> champions arose.\u201d\n>\n> Jillian C.
