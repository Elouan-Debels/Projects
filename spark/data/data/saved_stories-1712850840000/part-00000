Last updated on April 5, 2023.\n\nI heard generic Viagra is available now. Is that true?\n\n## Official answer\n\nby Drugs.com\n\nYes, generic Viagra is available in the U.S. The original patent for Viagra\nwas set to expire in 2020; however, Pfizer entered into an agreement to allow\nTeva Pharmaceuticals to launch the generic. In 2020, other generic\nmanufacturers will be able to enter the market with generic Viagra. Pfizer is\nalso offering its own generic that ditches the blue color (it\u2019s white) and\nhalf of the $65-a-pill retail price.\n\nGeneric Viagra has been available in Canada since 2012. In Europe, Viagra\nbecame available generically in 2013.\n\nThe lower dose form of Revatio (sildenafil) became available generically in\nthe U.S. in November 2012 because it is used for a different condition\n(pulmonary arterial hypertension). In the U.S., doctors may legally prescribed\ngeneric Revatio \u201coff-label\u201d to patients preferring a lower priced form of\nViagra for ED; however, multiple tablets may be needed as the dose form of\nRevatio only comes in a 20 milligram (mg) tablet. However, doctors are under\nno obligation to prescribe Revatio off-label.\n\nThe recommended dose of Viagra is 50 mg, as needed, approximately 1 hour\nbefore sexual activity. Doses may vary between 25 and 100 mg. The dose may be\nadjusted based on doctor recommendations, but it should not exceed 100 mg per\ndose or be taken more than once per day. Prices for generic Revatio\n(sildenafil 20 mg) will vary, too, and discount coupons for the generic\nRevatio may be found online to be used at your local pharmacy.\n\n## Related Questions\n\n  * Cialis vs Viagra - What's the difference between them?\n  * Can you take Viagra with high blood pressure?\n  * Can women take Viagra?\n\n## More about Viagra\n\nThe ease of taking an oral tablet for erectile dysfunction (ED) has\nrevolutionized ED treatment. Sildenafil is the generic formulation of Pfizer\u2019s\nViagra, the \u201clittle blue pill\u201d that has gained immense popularity for\ntreatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). It was originally approved in the U.S.\nin 1998, and over 30 million prescriptions have been dispensed for Viagra in\n120 countries.\n\nED is a common sexual problem for men and its frequency increases with age. A\nlarge survey conducted in the United States determined about half of all men\n40 to 70 years of age experience some degree of ED. Roughly 30 million men in\nthe U.S. and over 100 million men globally suffer from ED.\n\nViagra (sildenafil) was the first phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor\napproved to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Other competitor treatments now\nalso on the market for ED include tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).\nThese products are expected to lose patent in 2017 or 2018, and generics for\nthese drugs may become available at that time, even before Viagra.\n\n## Read next\n\nIt takes from 30 minutes to 1 hour for Viagra (sildenafil) to start working,\nand the effects will last for about 4 hours.
