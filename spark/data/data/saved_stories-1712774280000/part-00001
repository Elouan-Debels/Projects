Never building a product that generated revenue? We have,\ntoo, many times.\n\nAfter years of trying and building many products and courses, we have found\nsome success.\n\nWe're Robert and Tadas . With a combined audience of over 100,000 people,\nwe've made some internet money. We've also guided others from idea to earning\na living from their creations.\n\nWe want to help you do the same. With Hungrimind, you can take interactive\ncourses to learn the fundamentals and start building. Then, use us and the\ncommunity to guide you toward success. First call tomorrow\n\nBuilding a product involves a lot more than code. Our experience ranges from\nengineering to product and audience building. We're here to help you build\nproducts through content, courses, tools, and direct guidance from us.\n\nBecome a Member\n\n## Our Story\n\nWe both found a love for online teaching while working in our engineering\nroles. After we finished work, we would learn new technologies and teach them\nonline on YouTube. We got to know each other early in our YouTube careers and\nhelped each other build our platforms.\n\nAs enjoyable as our YouTube journey was, we found ourselves craving a more\ndirect impact on people's lives. Teaching was just the means to an end \u2013\nempowering others to build and innovate. So, we built Hungrimind, where we're\ndedicated to helping you throughout your building journey. Here, we can craft\nan experience entirely tailored to your needs.\n\nWe've built many products ourselves. You are currently using Hungrimind, which\nwas built solely by us. There are the products we built at our jobs: Peggy is\nan app to look at, learn about, buy, and even sell art. Agora UI Kit is a\npackage that allows you to build a video call in 4 lines of code.\n\nFlutter was our starting point, but our experience goes way beyond that. Our\nfavorite web framework is Astro, but we've dabbled in the most popular web and\napp technologies.\n\nWe have integrated all the solutions you need for a product, from creating\nlanding pages, user authentication, and authorization to payments and\nanalytics.\n\n## We built this for you\n\nGet a feel for how simple it is to take a course\n\n## Is this really for me?\n\nWe have made this platform for you, the builder. Our goal is to help you build\nonline products and tailer the platform for your needs.\n\nWe have taught on YouTube and gathered a combined five million views, as well\nas done consulting for businesses and clients. We have taken all our knowledge\nand created the platform we wished we had when we started.\n\nWe've done consulting calls priced at minimum $100/hour, each. Just 3\nconsulting calls is already $600.\n\nIf we would teach each course in a one-to-one meeting that would be up in the\nprice range of $2500 or more per course.\n\n## Become a Member\n\nSubscription or lifetime\n\nMonthlyYearly\n\n### Member\n\nGet access to all resources to allow you to build real products\n\n$19$12/month\n\n35% off - billed yearly\n\n  * Access to this course\n\n  * All future updates\n\n  * Access to current and upcoming courses\n\n  * Members only Chat\n\n  * Expert Support\n\n### Lifetime member\n\nGet access forever to all resources to allow you to build real products\n\n$499$299\n\n  * Access to this course\n\n  * All future updates\n\n  * Access to current and upcoming courses\n\n  * Members only Chat\n\n  * Expert Support\n\nPrices are going up soon!\n\n## calculating...\n\n## FAQ\n\n## Become a Member\n\nSubscription or lifetime\n\nMonthlyYearly\n\n### Member\n\nGet access to all resources to allow you to build real products\n\n$19$12/month\n\n35% off - billed yearly\n\n  * Access to this course\n\n  * All future updates\n\n  * Access to current and upcoming courses\n\n  * Members only Chat\n\n  * Expert Support\n\n### Lifetime member\n\nGet access forever to all resources to allow you to build real products\n\n$499$299\n\n  * Access to this course\n\n  * All future updates\n\n  * Access to current and upcoming courses\n\n  * Members only Chat\n\n  * Expert Support\n\n## Testimonials\n\nHere is what people are saying about the experience\n\n> Straight-to-the-point information holds immense value in today's world.\n> Hungrimind's interactive course offers value at supersonic speed.\n>\n> Einstein's philosophy resonates here: \"Everything should be made as simple\n> as possible, but not simpler.\"\n>\n> This course embodies three words: Creative, Fast, and Valuable.\n\nFlutterMapp\n\nFlutter Educator on Youtube (190k Subscribers)\n\n> I can confidently say that Robert has been instrumental in shaping my\n> journey as a developer.
