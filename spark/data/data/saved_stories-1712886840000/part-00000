And as these games\u2014like Fortnite, Roblox, and League of\nLegends\u2014have started to bring in millions and millions of dollars, it\u2019s led to\npublishers investing more and more into payment processors and other financial\nservices. All of this seems more like a bank than a video game, yet these\ncompanies and games don\u2019t have to play by the same rules as financial\ninstitutions. And this is something the U.S. government has noticed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#### Related Content\n\nSteam Remote Play Is Getting Prettier With 4K Streaming\n\nPC Developer Issues Takedown Notice Against Its Own Game, Claims Publisher\nPirated It\n\nThe Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition\n\nShare\n\nSubtitles\n\n  * Off\n  * English\n\nShare this Video\n\nFacebookTwitterEmail\n\nRedditLink\n\nThe Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition\n\n## The CFPB\u2019s new video game industry report\n\nOn April 4, the CFPB published a lengthy new report about banking inside\nvirtual worlds and video games. While the report doesn\u2019t signal that the CFPB\nis looking to take action and doesn\u2019t recommend any immediate plans, it does\nshow that the consumer-focused bureau is aware of how video games have become\nonline banks for many kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor many young people today, gaming may be their introduction to financial\nactivity,\u201d says the CFPB. \u201cFor example, gaming provides young people the\nopportunity to learn about earning currency, managing assets, and making\npurchases. Gaming companies may view young players as an opportunity to create\nlifelong consumers early.\u201d\n\nThe CFPB warns that these younger players are more vulnerable to advertising\nand monetization tactics, like bundling currencies together to hide their\nvalue. The CFPB also says that regardless of age, people can use these online\ngames as banks, even if the companies don\u2019t directly support this kind of\nbehavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany gaming companies also claim that their gaming assets have no monetary\nvalue, are irredeemable for fiat currency and that their environments function\nas closed markets,\u201d the CFPB writes. \u201cHowever, these markets can actually be\nquite porous and gaming assets can have considerable value, including outside\nof the game itself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CFPB explains that games let users buy assets and currencies using real\nmoney, and even though most games don\u2019t allow you to turn around and sell\nthose digital items to other players, a third-party ecosystem of shady\nwebsites and apps has popped up to facilitate those kinds of out-of-game\ntransactions. This means that digital assets in a game are treated like\ncurrencies with the current exchange rate of some items being publicly tracked\nonline.\n\nThe report also points out that digital, in-game items can become currencies\ninside the games themselves if the community agrees on it, citing an example\nof plastic chairs in an online game becoming a popular form of payment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the virtual world of Habbo Hotel, items are exchanged between players\nthrough the in-game market,\u201d says the report. \u201cPlastic chairs were originally\ndesigned to furnish virtual apartments. Over time, these chairs gradually\nbecame the currency of the game. Prices on the market would be denominated in\nplastic chairs, and the exchange of plastic chairs would allow players to buy\ngoods or services within the game.\u201d\n\n## Games are like banks, but lack security and regulation\n\nBecause assets are worth real money and can, using third-party services, be\nsold and traded for actual cash, video game accounts can be as valuable and\nimportant to players as their bank accounts. Yet, as the CFPB reports, most\nvideo game companies don\u2019t have bank-level security or protections in place\nfor user accounts. And when, inevitably, a player\u2019s account is hacked or\nstolen, game publishers don\u2019t do much to help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn complaints to the FTC and CFPB, several players reported hacking attempts,\naccount theft, scams, unauthorized transactions, and losing access to game\ncurrencies and virtual items, but they received limited recourse from gaming\ncompanies,\u201d writes the CFPB. \u201cGaming companies often take a \u2018buyer beware\u2019\napproach, putting the burden on individual players to avoid these scams and\nphishing attempts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey may lock or ban players\u2019 accounts suspected of scamming and phishing but\ndo little to provide remedy to the victim. For example, stolen items on Steam\nare not returned due in part to market incentives. Steam states that its\nvirtual items\u2019 value is \u2018at least partially determined by that item\u2019s\nscarcity. If more copies of the item are added to the economy...the value of\nevery other instance of that item would be reduced.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage: Epic Games\n\nThe report also documents that gamers have complained that their accounts were\nterminated when they tried to pursue recourse via their banks or credit card\ncompanies. When this happens, players are screwed out of their valuable\naccount.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a player loses access to their account because they are accused of\nviolating a game\u2019s terms of service or a game is terminated altogether, the\ngame publishers state that they have no obligation to compensate the players\nfor their lost assets or return the money players have invested,\u201d explains the\nCFPB in its report.\n\nIn the report\u2019s conclusion, the CFPB states that due to \u201climited consumer\nprotections,\u201d video game accounts are more susceptible to financial losses\nresulting from theft and scams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConsumer protection laws apply to banking and payment systems that facilitate\nthe storage and exchange of valuable assets,\u201d says the bureau. \u201cThe CFPB is\nmonitoring non-traditional markets where consumer financial products and\nservices may be offered, including where such products and services are\nprovided by or in connection with proprietary gaming platforms.\u201d\n\nIt will be curious to see if game publishers and companies like Valve pay\nattention to this report and try to improve security and offer better support\nfor their users. If not, the U.S. government may get more involved in\nregulating what\u2019s becoming a virtual Wild West of online video game banking\nand currencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
