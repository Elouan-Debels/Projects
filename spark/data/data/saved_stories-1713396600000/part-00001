Its effect is to\ncriminalize any further attempt by a particular mailer to continue to send\nadvertisement material to a particular recipient through the United States\nPostal Service.^[1] In addition, it demands that the mailer delete immediately\nthe names of the particular recipient from all mailing lists owned or\ncontrolled by the mailer or his agents or assigns and, further, prohibits the\nmailer and his agents or assigns from the sale, rental, exchange, or other\ntransaction involving mailing lists bearing the names of the particular\nrecipient.^[2] It is requested by filing United States Postal Service Form\n1500, either with a local Postmaster, or directly with the Prohibitory Order\nProcessing Center.^[1]\n\nHistorically, the Prohibitory Order was devised as a means of protecting\nfreedom of speech, while recognizing the rights of individual recipients not\nto receive advertisements they deem to be pornographic or otherwise offensive,\nand the absolute and unreviewable right of the recipient of a mailpiece to\ndetermine whether or not it is offensive. A prohibitory order against a\nspecific mailer, although the language of the application form implies that\nexplicit sexual content is the only basis for finding a mailpiece offensive,\nhas been extended by case law to allow the recipient to declare any mailpiece\nobscene, for any reason whatsoever, with no requirement to state the reason(s)\nfor taking offense.^[3] The only absolute requirement is that it must be\npossible to construe the mailpiece as an offer to sell goods or services.\nVarious rulings have upheld the Supreme Court decision that the postal\ncustomer's discretion is not subject to review.^[4]\n\nIn addition, recipients may use Form 1500 to apply for a general prohibitory\norder, covering any mailpiece that may be deemed offensive on the basis of\nexplicit sexual content.^[1]\n\n## Process[edit]\n\n  1.
