I was coding my way through the Ray Tracer\nChallenge. Turn on copilot. Wow. Just tab to complete. Microsoft (M$) shipped\nthis thing? The lawyers let them!?\n\n## The Crutch\n\nOf all the dumb things I\u2019ve talked about in interviews, talking about\nintegrated development environments as a crutch, is probably the dumbest. I\nthink the special mix of jet lag, booze, and delays in travel really set me up\nfor anti-success for my Microsoft interview right out of undergrad. It couldnt\nhave been a skillissue.org.\n\nTwasn\u2019t good but here is how it went.\n\n## Ready to Move to Washington State\n\nSo how do you land a job interview at M$? Well... they come to your campus, if\nyou are going to a college with a decent programming reputation. Once or twice\na year they will be there. At the career fair, or just sometimes they setup in\nthe Harris Building at UCF. Then look at your resume and pass you to a very,\nvery, very easy interview on campus.\n\nIf you pass, you get free trip to Washington! At this point I bought a copy of\ncracking the coding interview and pretty much made plans how I\u2019d slice up the\ncompany when I was running it. I was surely hired. I\u2019m best programmer I know.\nBesides Arup maybe.\n\n### Hiring Pipeline\n\nMicrosoft has one of these impressive hiring pipelines. They send out their\njesters into the universities of the world. And send them all back to the\nmothership. Right away I knew something was wrong, I was overdressed. Though\nmy scrum master look was on point with corduroy jacket. There was at-least a\nHUNDRED other people interviewing at same time as me. Of course they bussed us\nall around Redmond. Washington is beautiful.\n\n### The Lead Interview\n\nLet\u2019s just skip to the main dude for the coding. I got bussed to a building\nthat was pretty nice and old. It reminds me of a 90s mall. Looks legit though,\nI could work here.\n\nMeet guy, guy is nice. Indian (not that it matters) \u2014 impeccable\nskills/english/etc a pro. I think he is the lead of his team. Ok, turns out he\nis running some division of Onenote. Due diligence has not been done, but I do\nknow Onenote, well some of it.\n\nPleasant meeting start. He is obviously passionate about the tool he creates.\nWe talk multi-player editors and how Onenote was first before google docs in\ncollaborative editing. I point out you can actually see the cursor change in\ngoogle\u2019s implementation\n\nAnyways. Leet code challenge.\n\n> Order and remove duplicates in a list. Can only pass through list one time,\n> and You cannot allocate any new memory?\n>\n> Leet Code Challenge 1 \u2013 M$ Onenote 2014\n\nCalculating the hash is too expensive (he says), can\u2019t use dictionaries...\nugh. I struggle through and think i get a decent whiteboard of flow. But I\npretty much try and get more help than the Lead is willing to give me. This is\nmy worst nightmare. Score 5/10 (my scoring) \u2014 I feel like there was another\ngotcha, but I blocked it out.\n\n#### Coding on Demand\n\nCoding on a whiteboard with no auto-complete, google (at the time), and now no\nco-pilot. It is a different skill than anything you normally do for the job.\nExcept when you teach people how to code, of course. This is what you are\ndoing when you run code in your head with 2 people, 1 marker, and a\nwhiteboard: The Mind Compiler\n\nThis is the opposite of what I do when I try to hire a programmer BTW :*\n\n### The Nerd Interview\n\nI get the sense that I failed the first interview, but I have 2 more. He is\nmoving me again to another person on the team. I am in the Onenote enclave i\u2019m\nrealizing.\n\nOk so I get dropped off with another team member, immigrant from western\nEurope. Nice older fella. This interview is more personal and we talk about my\nprojects and OpenCV and he is shocked that it has is a C++ API. Dude is living\nunder a rock. But really nice and we both learned something from each other.\nThe coding challenge was tough, but I can\u2019t remember it now. I probably got\n9/10 on it.\n\n### The Yeoman Interview\n\nOk so now i get dropped off into an office with no windows. This dude is\ncookin\u2019 something up in here. Probably building serious shit. He worked in\nsomewhat of a lab. He was closest to my age, although I may have been older\nthan him. The other two were def 10+ years my senior.\n\nHe hits me how to see if there is a cycle in a linked list. I wink at him and\nregurgitate it. We goto lunch. In this lunch I open up about some\nphilosophies.\n\n\u201cI love IDEs but they are crutch\u201d he nods in agreement, but you can see the\nlook in his eyes. I will not fit in here. I can remember it turning quickly.\nMaybe it was my shit performance in the beginning with the lead. But I only\nhad 3 interviews that day.\n\nI went back to central FL with a story and a fire in my belly.\n\n## Back to Copilot\n\nPlease understand that I\u2019m not a acc/decc but this technology is not to be\ntaken lightly. Ok so what is Copilot?\n\n    \n    \n    GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity. Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE and CLI. In early-2024, it will also include GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business and adds an additional layer of customization for organizations as well as GitHub Copilot integrated into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse about their codebase and action buttons throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization\u2019s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer\u2019s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion. GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.\n\nI turned it on fully leaded at first. Is this fair use? Hell nah. GPL is\nviral. You can\u2019t spoon feed off entire codebase like this. This isn\u2019t clean\nroomed reverse engineering for sure.\n\nOk so lets try turning on \u201cdon\u2019t produce public code\u201d whatever that means.\n\nI was going to make videos, and talk and aand and... just go use it.\n\nBeware.\n\n## Admonitions\n\nThis copy pasta machine will need to be severely neutered to be useful in a\ncodebase you want to maintain ownership of. The virality of some of the\nlicenses, you will lose control. For instance at the job, we cannot use\ncopilot. Legal will not allow it!\n\n  * copy and pasting code is generally frowned on, you should go through the motions to actually type. think and internalize it. just like you are playing a song on a guitar\n  * remember: most of us old timers learned by copy pasta from a 1980s tech magazine basic.\n  * Use the crutch, but walk without it sometimes!\n\n### Related\n\n#### Sea Change\n\nI've been promised Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence (AI) all my\nlife.
