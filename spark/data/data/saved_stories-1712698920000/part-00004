Vaughan-Nichols on April 8, 2024\n\nWhen HashiCorp dumped its open-source Mozilla license for the Business Source\nLicense (BSL 1.1) for its flagship program, infrastructure as code (IaC) tool\nTerraform, many Terraform developers and partners were ticked off. As open\nsource developers are wont to do in such situations, they created a Terraform\nfork, called OpenTofu.\n\nSo far, that\u2019s business as usual when a company shifts a project away from\nopen source. Things heated up, though, when the Linux Foundation announced it\nwould support the new fork. Now, the conflict between HashiCorp and OpenTofu\nis starting to boil, as HashiCorp accused OpenTofu of \u201cnot respecting the\nterms of its BSL license governing its Terraform codebase.\u201d\n\nThem\u2019s fighting words!\n\nOpenTofu replied, \u201cOpenTofu vehemently disagrees with any suggestion that it\nmisappropriated, mis-sourced, or otherwise misused HashiCorp\u2019s BSL code.\u201d The\norganization added, \u201cHashiCorp may be conflating code that it had previously\nbeen open-sourced under the MPL and more recently developed code it published\nunder the BSL.\u201d And, OpenTofu says, it will \u201cissue a written response\nproviding a more detailed explanation of its position.\u201d\n\nSo, what is this code in question? Neither Hashicorp nor Terraform is saying,\nquite yet. However, it appears to be a \u201cremoved block\u201d automation process that\nenables Terraform to manage resource deletion.\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nMatt Asay, MongoDB\u2018s VP of Developer Relations, revealed this accusation. He\naccused OpenTofu of lifting the \u201cremoved block\u201d code, which was released under\nthe BSL a few months after the OpenTofu fork was created. \u201cThe tell? OpenTofu\ntook this BUSL-licensed HashiCorp code, removed the headers, and tried to\ninstead relicense it under the Mozilla Public License (MPL 2.0),\u201d Asay wrote.\n\nOh, it\u2019s on now.\n\nEven before news of the legally threatening message emerged, prominent open\nsource leaders attacked Asay\u2019s claim. Bryan Cantrill, the hyper-cloud Oxide\nComputer co-founder and CTO, claimed, \u201cThis is an extraordinarily serious\naccusation \u2013 and the cited files frankly don\u2019t substantiate it.\u201d\n\nCantrill is far from alone in thinking that there is insufficient evidence to\njustify the accusation that OpenTofu has stolen any code. Until we have harder\nevidence, the issue will remain a case of \u201cHe said, she said.\u201d\n\nChris Aniszczyk, the CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a\nLinux Foundation-related organization, doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good look for\nHashiCorp. He said it\u2019s \u201cembarrassing to see a company light all of its hard-\nearned developer reputation on fire, on top of attacking open source.\u201d\n\nDan Lorenc, CEO and co-founder of Chainguard, a software supply chain security\ncompany, warns this could be the start of something big and ugly in software\ndevelopment circles. \u201cI don\u2019t have any philosophical or ethical issues with\nsource-available licenses, but their proponents are going to have to address\nthese cease-and-desist threats,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDevelopers working in OSS (OSI/FSF\napproved licenses) are going to be prevented from engaging with or even\nlooking at source-available projects completely to prevent the risk of\nlawsuits. It\u2019s just too risky to pretend otherwise.\u201d\n\nLorenc adds, \u201cThere\u2019s no gradual transition here, it\u2019s going to be a hard fork\nin communities if these lawsuit threats keep continuing. And I know which\ncommunity I\u2019d bet on sticking around.\u201d\n\nI lived through the SCO-Linux copyright wars. I think I know who will win,\ntoo.\n\nPhoto credit: Quino Al on Unsplash\n\nApril 8, 2024April 8, 2024 Steven J.
