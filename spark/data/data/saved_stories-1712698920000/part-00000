Dan Levine has been a spiritual co-\nfounder for Val Town since before the first line of code. He led our $1.5m\npre-seed in August 2022, and is now joining our board.\n\nVal Town is a social website to write and deploy serverless functions. Create\nwebsites, APIs, and crons from your browser. For example, you can:\n\n  * Scrape for when your sea light swizzles are in stock\n  * Toot your latest blog posts to Mastodon\n  * Send RSS items to Posthog\n  * Generate SVG badges or open graph images\n  * Build a face swaping app with Replicate\n\nOur mission is end-user programming. Everyone should be able to build\nsoftware, tailor apps to their needs, and automate their lives.\n\nI fell in love with programming as a kid. LOGO is a programming language that\nlets you control a turtle on the screen. You can make it move forward, turn,\nand draw lines. I still remember the feeling of empowerment when I figured out\nhow to draw a square.\n\nSeymour Papert, the creator of LOGO, had a theory. If French kids learn French\nsimply growing up in France, could kids learn math better by growing up in\n\u201cMathland\u201d? He created LOGO to be such a Mathland for kids to naturally\nassimilate powerful mental models: a debugging mindset, precision,\nabstraction, modularity, and a warm feeling of ownership over these skills.\n\nI learned to imagine myself in the turtle\u2019s shoes and walk out the route I\nwanted it to follow, and then encode that route into code. Later in calculus,\nI was able to effortlessly assimilate the concept of a derivative: I imagined\nmyself walking along the curve, and the derivative just was my orientation at\nany point. To my classmates, it looked like I was smart. I was just a kid who\nhad grown up in Mathland.\n\nVal Town is not an educational tool. It\u2019s a pro tool for building real\nsoftware. But it is designed to be learnable. Programming in Val Town should\nfeel more like editing a spreadsheet (live, fluid, reactive) than using a\ntraditional IDE. Like the spreadsheet, Val Town is where beginners start and\nbig companies scale core infrastructure. Come for the code hosting, stay for\nthe community, and become smarter along the way.\n\nWe believe that code is still the best interface (so far) to build\napplications. But knowing how to code isn\u2019t enough to ship useful software.\nThere is so much around the code that needs to happen: setting up a\ndevelopment environment, setting up a deployment environment, scaling,\nlogging, monitoring, version control, persistence, etc. How many times have\nyou had an idea for a little website, API or cron, but gave up? We want to\nmake it so fast and fun to solve problems with code that you actually ship all\nthose wonderful ideas you have to improve things for yourself, communities,\nand workplace.\n\nIn Val Town, you write code and hit save. Your code is immediately deployed.\nEverything you need is right at your fingertips: logging, monitoring,\nversions, error tracking, persistence, scaling, and more. Every Val Town\naccount comes with a hosted SQLite database, blob storage, the ability to send\nand receive emails, and limited OpenAI access.\n\nIf we don\u2019t include something, likely someone in Val Town community has\nalready built and shared it. You can just import it. We\u2019re a social coding\nplatform, with hosting built-in, so anyone else\u2019s public code is instantly\nrunnable within your own account. A fork is like an install. There\u2019s nothing\nto setup or deploy.\n\nNico\u2019s SQLite Explorer is a good example of our community at play. It\u2019s a\nhandy admin view for your built-in SQLite database. Nico\u2019s val imports from\ndozens of other vals, from @postpostscript, @pomdtr, and @andreterron.\n\nI found this list of dependencies by \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 another community val,\nRobert\u2019s Dependency Graph Viewer.\n\nOur community is also really good at requesting features. This funding will\nlet us grow our team to ship many of your wonderful requests: make vals\nfaster, more reliable and secure, easier to find, organize, collaborate on,\ninstall, branch, test, and share. We\u2019re building the place where you write the\nfirst line of code that becomes your next side project, internal tool, or\nstartup.\n\nWe care deeply about sustainability. We\u2019re building Val Town to be around for\na long time. We\u2019re growing our team slowly, commensurate with revenue. We\u2019re\nbuilding a business model that aligns with our users and a platform that is\nopen and interoperable.\n\nWe are excited to have so many heroes, friends, and advisors joining our cap\ntable. It takes a village town: Tom Preston-Werner, Guillermo Rauch, James\nLindenbaum, Adam Wiggins, David Cramer, Simon Last, Calvin French-Owen, Matt\nMcClure, Zapier\u2019s Investment Fund, Tod Sacerdoti, Cristina Cordova, Matt\nBrezina, Ben Vinegar, Chet Corcos, Devon Zuegel, Sebastian Bensusan, Linus\nLee, Michelle Lim, Dan Shipper, Shawn @swyx Wang, Meagan Gamache, Yasyf\nMohamedali, Daniel Marcotte, Nick Arner, and Jordan Scales.\n\nVal Town is a small team that ships quickly and dreams big.\n\nMax, Steve, Tom, Andr\u00e9\n\nWe\u2019re hiring a design engineer and generalist engineer in Brooklyn. Join us!\n\nThe next time you have an idea for a website, API, or cron, build it on Val\nTown.\n\nThanks for helpful feedback, Dan Levine, Tom MacWright, Andr\u00e9 Terron, Max\nMcDonnell, Matthew Williams, Max Bittker, and Rodger Krouse. Thanks Yagil\nBurowski for taking the photo of our team.\n\nEdit this page\n\n\u00a9 2024 Val Town.
