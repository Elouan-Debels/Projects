By simply asking the LLM for an\n> answer, or ``prompting,'' practitioners are able to use LLMs to quickly get\n> a response for an arbitrary task. This prompting is done through a series of\n> decisions by the practitioner, from simple wording of the prompt, to\n> requesting the output in a certain data format, to jailbreaking in the case\n> of prompts that address more sensitive topics. In this work, we ask: do\n> variations in the way a prompt is constructed change the ultimate decision\n> of the LLM? We answer this using a series of prompt variations across a\n> variety of text classification tasks. We find that even the smallest of\n> perturbations, such as adding a space at the end of a prompt, can cause the\n> LLM to change its answer. Further, we find that requesting responses in XML\n> and commonly used jailbreaks can have cataclysmic effects on the data\n> labeled by LLMs.\n\nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2401.03729 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2401.03729v3 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.03729arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Abel Salinas [view email] [v1] Mon, 8 Jan 2024 08:28:08 UTC (251 KB)\n[v2] Tue, 9 Jan 2024 05:07:02 UTC (251 KB) [v3] Mon, 1 Apr 2024 20:56:11 UTC\n(312 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled The Butterfly Effect of Altering Prompts: How\nSmall Changes and Jailbreaks Affect Large Language Model Performance, by Abel\nSalinas and Fred Morstatter\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2401\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.AI\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
