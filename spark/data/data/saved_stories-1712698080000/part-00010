Yes, this planet is our\nhome, warm and wet and brimming with life, but significant chunks of\nelectromagnetic spectrum are blocked by Earth\u2019s atmosphere, magnetic field\nand\u2014more recently\u2014the growing cacophony of wireless signals.\n\nAstronomers could, in just the next few years, start to solve the problem in a\nremarkable way: Putting radio telescopes on the far side of the moon, where\nthe moon\u2019s mass would block out all that electronic noise. For radio signals,\nit is probably the quietest place in the inner solar system. That\u2019s in part\nbecause the moon is tidally locked, meaning that the far side always faces\naway from Earth. It\u2019s also because as the universe expands, many distant\nsignals are shifted toward longer wavelengths that are impossible for earthly\ntelescopes to detect.\n\nThe potential is tremendous. If telescopes on the moon can work in radio\nsilence, scientists talk of detecting the magnetospheres of exoplanets\ncircling other stars. Or gravitational waves, the invisible \u201cripples\u201d in\nspace-time caused by some of the most violent events in the distant universe.\nOr even far-infrared signatures of the so-called dark ages, the period of\nabout 400 million years after the big bang before the first stars and galaxies\nbegan to form.\n\nMuch of the electromagnetic spectrum is invisible to Earth-based telescopes or\ndrowned out by interference.LeonArt Studio/Alamy\n\nBut even this solution has a looming problem\u2014namely, that everyone else\ninterested in space has thought of the moon\u2019s potential as well. Over the next\ntwo or three years, there could well be two dozen lunar missions, each one\nlanding astronauts, starting mining operations\u2014and transmitting on countless\nfrequencies. There\u2019s something of a lunar gold rush in progress, and\nastronomers want to make sure science doesn\u2019t get trampled.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this sometimes as being a kind of Wild West mentality, a\nfree-for-all, and we want to avoid that,\u201d says Jack Burns of the University of\nColorado in Boulder. He and many colleagues are sounding the alarm, at\nconferences and in peer-reviewed journals, hoping to ensure radio silence for\nthe moon\u2019s far side before it\u2019s too late.\n\nBurns has been an investigator on some of the earliest efforts in moon-based\nradio astronomy, including Intuitive Machines\u2019 Odysseus spacecraft, which in\nFebruary made the first-ever landing by a commercial company on the lunar\nsurface. One of its payloads was an antenna array called ROLSES, meant partly\nto test for charged particles near the lunar surface. Odysseus had a hard\nlanding, but it was one step on a roadmap of experiments physicists have\nplanned. An experiment called LuSEE-Night could be launched as soon as 2026,\ncarried to the back of the moon by a lander from Firefly Aerospace.\n\nA bigger project, called FARSIDE, aims to lay out a 10-kilometer\ninterferometer in an area blocked from Earth. If it works, it will listen for\nsignals from the most distant corners of the universe\u2014signals that could\neasily be drowned out by lunar satellites sent from the United States, China,\nIndia or, for that matter, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX or other private companies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for this incredibly weak signal,\u201d says Joseph Silk, an\nastrophysicist who has done pioneering work on understanding the early\nuniverse. \u201cWe\u2019re looking way back to the early universe.\u201d\n\nBurns is quick to say that the lunar gold rush can actually be a good thing\nfor scientists. \u201cThis is a whole new era of space and space exploration, these\npublic-private partnerships, these entrepreneurs, these billionaires who are\ninvesting in space,\u201d he says. They may be out to mine the moon or profit from\ngovernment programs, but they\u2019re also building infrastructure\u2014landers,\ncommunications networks and so forth\u2014that scientists can use as well as\nentrepreneurs.\n\nThe worry is that things will happen that nobody anticipated. For instance,\nelectrical circuits on spacecraft tend to \u201cleak\u201d unintended signals into space\nunless they\u2019re adequately shielded. Imagine a satellite in lunar orbit,\nperhaps sent to observe the near side of the moon, ruining the observations by\na radio telescope on the far side when it passes over.\n\nThe LuSEE-Night experiment, shown here mounted atop Blue Ghost Mission 2 in an\nartist\u2019s concept, is planned for a mission to the far side of the moon.Firefly\nAerospace\n\nRichard Green of the Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona tells of\na conference he attended in Paris last month, where he talked about\ninterference risks with people from major European aerospace companies. \u201cTheir\nreaction was, by and large, \u2018That\u2019s really interesting. We were unaware,\u2019\u201d he\nsays.\n\nGreen says he doesn\u2019t run into resistance, but it\u2019s different than dealing\nwith government agencies like NASA. \u201cThere\u2019s a new pressure, which is to\nminimize expense as well as optimizing performance. So if a commercial\noperator doesn\u2019t need to spend on the extra design complication of careful\nshielding, they won\u2019t do that voluntarily.\u201d\n\nSo how to solve the problem before it becomes a crisis? Many scientists\nsuggest working out a treaty through the International Telecommunication\nUnion, an agency of the United Nations. Past agreements\u2014the Outer Space Treaty\nof 1967, the Antarctic treaty\u2014have been effective, though none is a perfect\nmodel for protecting scientific sites on the lunar far side.\n\nGreen says he came away concerned after previous experience at the United\nNations. \u201cThey work by unanimous consent. So every single nation has to agree.\nThat is to say Russia, China, the U.S. and Iran. And right now, Russia and\nIran are in a mood to obstruct. So there are reasons why progress could,\npossibly, be slow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we have to do it,\u201d says Silk. \u201cOtherwise, it will be chaos on the moon.\u201d\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * The Plan to Give the Moon Decent Wireless Coverage - IEEE ... \u203a\n  * Rovers Will Unroll a Telescope on the Moon's Far Side - IEEE ... \u203a\n\nRelated Articles Around the Web\n\n  * Lunar Crater Radio Telescope - Wikipedia \u203a\n  * Lunar Crater Radio Telescope (LCRT) on the Far-Side of the Moon ... \u203a\n\nlunar explorationtelescopesradio astronomyradio telescope\n\nNed Potter\n\nis a New York writer who spent more than 25 years as an ABC News and CBS News\ncorrespondent covering science, technology, space, and the environment.

For more than a decade, materials\nscientists have been tweaking materials on tiny scales to harvest electric\ncharge from moving water. Now, by making a fundamental change to one such\ndevice\u2019s design, a group at Central South University in Changsha, China has\nmanaged to more than double its current collection capabilities.\n\nTo be precise, the Changsha group\u2019s device is called the triboelectric\nnanogenerator (TENG). True to their name, TENGs rely on the triboelectric\neffect: If one material rubs across another, electric charge can transfer from\none to the other. Given the correct materials, a TENG can then harvest that\nmoving charge as electricity. The \u201cnano\u201d part comes in the material: Creating\nan effective TENG requires shaping the material with very small structures in\norder to tweak the electric exchange into drawing more current.\n\nKeep Reading \u2193 Show less\n\nAerospace COMSOL Resource Library Computing Engineering Resources Sponsored\nArticle\n\n## Fine-Tuning the Factory: Simulation App Helps Optimize Additive\nManufacturing Facility\n\n###\n\nAdditive manufacturing processes can provide rapid and customizable production\nof high-quality components\n\nAlan Petrillo\n\n12 Jan 2023\n\n7 min read\n\n3\n\nAn example of a part produced through the metal powder bed fusion process.\n\nThis sponsored article is brought to you by COMSOL.\n\nHistory teaches that the Industrial Revolution began in England in the\nmid-18th century.

Although it is\ncommonly believed that VHF propagation is mostly \"line of sight,\" true line of\nsight propagation is in fact relatively rare in terrestrial applications.\nSignals at VHF normally experience refraction, reflection, diffraction, and\nscattering, with these effects often increasing with distance.\n\nIn addition to these common propagation modes, there are several uncommon\nmodes at VHF. This educational note introduces the four most important of\nthese modes: tropospheric ducting, sporadic E, meteor burst, and \"Earth-Moon-\nEarth\" (EME). Tropospheric ducting and sporadic E are not commonly used for\ncommunications due to their unpredictable appearance, but they are both\nsufficiently common that they can create issues with regard to interference,\ndirection finding, and signals intelligence applications. Other modes, such as\nmeteor burst and EME, can however provide reliable long-distance communication\nat VHF, and thus represent potential backup communications methods at the\nregional or global level.\n\nThe Institute History of Technology Guest Article IEEE History\n\n## How Engineers at Digital Equipment Corp.
