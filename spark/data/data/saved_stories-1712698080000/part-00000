Consequently, 2.2m children had to stay home.\nSouth Sudan\u2019s school attainment rates are already deplorably bad. Secondary\nschool enrollment rate is barely above 11%. These kinds of disruptions, which\nundoubtedly will become more common as global temperatures rise, will only\nworsen education attainment rates and therefore dampen South Sudan\u2019s growth\nprospects. In general, research suggests that failure to mitigate high\ntemperatures will mean that both farm and non-farm work will struggle to see\nany productivity gains. There\u2019s very little air conditioning or irrigation\ninfrastructure in South Sudan.\n\nThe subtext here is that even before it can consider transitioning to a\ngreener way of life, South Sudan needs rapid economic growth and development\nin order to be able to address the effects of climate change.\n\nThe challenge extends beyond the education sector and South Sudan\u2019s borders.\nAccording to the New York Times:\n\n> The heat wave is also expected to put pressure on the country\u2019s nascent\n> health care system, which has long grappled with limited financing and\n> worker shortages.\n>\n> South Sudan is not the only African country where extreme weather events\n> have precipitated school shutdowns. In 2022, Malawi\u2019s government shortened\n> the school day in the southern Shire Valley because of rising temperatures.\n> And in Uganda, severe floods have repeatedly forced the government to close\n> schools over the years.\n\nThe other news story was a BBC Hardtalk interview with the President of\nGuyana, Mohamed Irfaan Ali. At some point in their exchange, the interviewer\nraised the question of whether Guyana\u2019s coming oil bonanza reflects a lack of\nconcern for fossil fuels\u2019 impact on climate change. To his credit, Ali was\nprepared with a strong answer, and argued that countries like Guyana already\ndo their part to reduce emissions by preserving forests (not to mention not\nhaving been historical polluters). More importantly, Guyana needs all the\ngrowth it can get in order to improve livelihoods.\n\nOverall the BBC interview reflects a prevailing unwillingness by many\ncommentators, academics, climate activists, and policymakers to (i) understand\nthat energy poverty is bad, and all countries have a legitimate right to\nescape energy poverty and general material want; and (ii) that tackling\nclimate change will require a disaggregated approach whereby historical\npolluters in high-income countries aggressively reduce their emissions and\ninvest in green alternatives, while lower-income countries gradually\ntransition to green technologies (and in some cases subsidized by wealthier\ncountries) without jeopardizing their own growth prospects.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear. Human-caused climate change is real and we should do\neverything in our power to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere. In addition, the choice between accelerating economic growth and\ndevelopment in low-income countries and urgently tackling climate change is a\nfalse choice. We can do both.\n\nIn fact, making growth work for climate mitigation, adaptation, and transition\nmight be the best chance we have got \u2014 especially in low-income countries. It\nis a losing proposition to suggest that, in order to save the planet, low-\nincome countries should embrace energy poverty and forego growth and\ndevelopment. Why should they be the ones to provide this public good? In the\nsame vein, it would be wrong for high-income countries to bully lower-income\ncountries into signing into anti-growth climate pacts and policies, including\nvia the back door of development assistance.\n\nTwo important facts ought to guide our thinking about climate change and\neconomic growth and development.\n\n  1. The whole point of trying to save the planet is to make it safe for human habitation. Therefore, it would be odd to completely ignore the human welfare implications of green policies \u2014 especially in the poorest parts of the world. It also follows that people who take extreme misanthropic positions regarding climate change should be roundly ignored.\n\n  2. At the moment, growth and broad-based development are the best safeguards against climate disasters, environmental degradation, and future greenhouse emissions. The effects of climate change are already among us, and hitting low-income countries the hardest. These countries need grow as fast as possible so they can have cash for infrastructure that can withstand flooding and extreme temperatures; agricultural technologies and infrastructure that are resilient to climate change; and yes, investments in green technologies for the future. Keeping low-income countries poor today will not only keep their populations exposed to the vagaries of climate impacts, but also forestall investments in the green technologies of the future.\n\nFor these reasons policymakers in low-income countries should carefully\nscrutinize all policy prescriptions that come with climate riders. In the\ngrand scheme of things, the promises of donor funding that accompany such\npolicies are simply not worth it. If in doubt, look at the total lack of\nseriousness with which high-income countries treat their promises to provide\nfinancial support for climate mitigation and adaptation in low-income\ncountries. Often, the real action happens around initiatives like the European\nUnion\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that is projected to reduce\nAfrican economic output by up to $25b. When the rubber meets the road, only\nsuckers will be left embracing (energy) poverty in the name of saving the\nplanet.\n\nIt is regrettable that too many politicians, policymakers, civil society\nactors in African states remain vulnerable to intellectual and policy capture\nregarding what ought to be done about climate change. The allure of quick\n(aid) cash and the need to keep getting invited to global talking shops have\nled several to commit to climate targets or policy schemes that will subject\ntheir populations to unconscionable levels of (energy) poverty for years to\ncome. Climate discourse in the region has largely been divorced from energy\nneeds and reduced to talking about carbon sinks and conserving biodiversity\n(and associated financial schemes). The problem of energy poverty and how it\ncontinues to fuel material want in most African states remains ignored.\nMeanwhile, carbon financing scams are accumulating at a rapid pace.\n\nPer capita consumption data across African states, compared to Todd Moss\u2019s\nfridge. Source: Eat More Electrons\n\nTo be blunt, any climate agenda that doesn\u2019t recognize the very urgent need to\nend energy poverty across Africa should be rejected outright. Energy-poor\ncountries must not let themselves become preserved sites where firms and\nhouseholds in energy-rich countries earn their carbon credits and the license\nto pollute. This concern motivates my skepticism of any attempts to pitch low-\nincome countries as places for achieving low-cost \u201cquick wins\u201d in tackling\nclimate change. In a world where (experts from) high-income countries set the\nagenda, the pursuit of such \u201cquick wins\u201d will undoubtedly come at the expense\nof improvements in energy access and human welfare in low-income states.\n\n###\n\nII: Energy poverty is bad for humans, for economic development and job\ncreation, and for the environment\n\nHow can economic growth \u2014 which often comes with increasing emissions of\ngreenhouse gases \u2014 be good for the planet? The answer lies in the fact that\n(1) economic growth enables households and economies to move up the energy\nladder, thereby using ever safer and cleener sources of energy; and (2)\neconomic growth and development opens up new sectors (jobs sans smokestacks)\nthat facilitate further growth under conditions of declining consumption-based\nemissions (i.e., country-based emissions figures that account for imports from\nmore polluting jurisdictions).\n\nThe first answer above assumes that those of us who care about reorienting\nhuman economic activity towards greater sustainability also care about the\ncosts imposed on actual humans by energy poverty. In her recently published\nbook, Not the End of the World, Hannah Ritchie presents data describing the\nidea of the energy ladder and associated household-level health costs at each\nstage of the ladder. Using wood and charcoal for fuel causes lots of\nrespiratory illnesses that kill lots of people, not to mention causing\ndeforestation in some contexts. Importantly, economic growth and development\nis a good way of reducing household pollution by moving households from solid\nfuels to cleaner energy.\n\nUnfortunately, in most African states, the share of people using solid fuels\nas the main cooking fuels has not declined fast enough (see below). As a\nresult, household pollution \u201cis the third highest risk factor for mortality\nand morbidity in Africa.\u201d Africa accounts for 15% of the world population and\n34% of its usage of \u201ctraditional\u201d fuels. This has to change, primarily due to\nthe human costs of household pollution. Moving up the energy ladder is not\nnegotiable.\n\nThe second answer above goes beyond the household and arises from an\nunderstanding of the underlying processes related to structural economic\nchange. In short, economic development enables the decoupling of further\nincreases in economic activity (and broad improvements in livelihoods) and\ncarbon emissions. This is because development gives rise to less energy-\nintensive sectors, efficient use of energy, and the ability to invest in\ncleaner energy (including renewables).\n\nTrends in emissions and GDP. Source: IEA\n\nAll else equal, the decoupling of emissions from economic activity appears to\nbe greater at higher levels of income (see above). Perhaps those who do not\ncare about energy poverty in the Continent hope that the region\u2019s governments\nwill continue to preside over poor low-energy economies. But I wouldn\u2019t bet on\nit. The region\u2019s demographics and urbanization trends point to a future when\ngovernments will no longer be able to get away with policies that condone\nenergy poverty.\n\nMost high-income countries have already seen their peak total emission levels\n(see above). The challenge for the world is whether collective action will\nensure that current developing countries\u2019 emissions peak at lower levels of\nemissions, even as their populations continue to grow. Potential ways of\nachieving this outcome include subsidizing the electrification of households,\nindustrial activity, and transportation (especially trains!!!), sharing green\ntechnologies (especially solar, wind, and pumped-hydroelectric storage), and\ninvesting in battery research.\n\nWidespread electrification would ensure that even in economies that currently\nuse \u201cdirty\u201d sources of power would be able to quickly transition once cleaner\npower sources comes online (for example, despite their continuing high\ndependence on coal (74.3%), we should all celebrate India\u2019s electrification of\n94% its rail network). More people need to know that electrification is is the\nfirst step towards energy efficiency.\n\n###\n\nIII: When the people who should aren\u2019t bothered by endemic energy poverty as a\nconstrained to economic growth and development\n\nEnergy poverty is not a viable climate strategy. There is no shortcut to\nachieving broad-based economic development (including increased industrial\ncapacity for mass job creation) without solving for reliable energy access\n(green or not). For example, research shows that unstable power access is a\ncause of significant job losses in African economies. Electricity outages\nincrease unemployment by between 4.7-13.5 percentage points, effects of which\nare largely concentrated in non-agricultural sectors that employ skilled\nworkers. Private sector employees are the worst affected. Furthermore,\nunreliable power supply decreases the entry of new firms, reduces the\nproductivity of incumbent firms, and suppresses labor demand.\n\nWith figures like these, how are the 10m Africans that enter the labor force\neach year supposed to earn a living? How will African economies be able to\nserve the 600m who lack access to reliable electricity throughout the region?\n\nIt is a no-brainer than the only climate plans worth pursuing are those that\nprioritize ending energy poverty. First, such plans would correctly\ninternalize the welfare implications of energy poverty. Second, climate plans\nthat end poverty will be self-enforcing in the long-run by facilitating growth\nand ensuring structural decoupling of future increased economic activity from\nlevels of emissions.\n\nCurrent approaches in the region fall far short of the goal of ending energy\npoverty. A common theme across initiatives tends to be a fixation on goals,\nwithout a firm grasp about specific steps needed to achieve them. To\nillustrate, consider the example of the World Bank\u2019s Country Climate and\nDevelopment Report for Liberia:\n\nThe report provides lots of scary figures. Rice production (Liberia\u2019s staple)\ncould shrink by up to 13% between 2041-2050. Climate change could reduce GDP\nby 15% by 2050. 90% of rural households use wood for cooking and 70% or urban\nhouseholds use fuel coal or charcoal. 75% lack access to clean water.\nElectricity access is at 28%. Only 0.4% have access to clean cooking fuels.\n\nThere also proposed solutions which, given the figures above, are thoroughly\nunderwhelming. 60% of households currently using wood or charcoal are supposed\nto get \u201cenergy efficient\u201d cook stoves by 2030. Increasing electricity access\nis acknowledged as a goal, but only in passing because \u201cit needs to be\naccompanied by a dedicated clean cooking agenda that offers affordable and\ndesirable energy alternatives.\u201d Forget that champions of cookstoves\u2019 impact on\nemissions \u201care probably overstating their beneficial impact on the climate by\nan average of 1,000%.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most glaring omission in the report is any serious discussion of\nLiberia\u2019s crushing levels of energy poverty and the need to end it (not to\nmention the how). Instead, there is discussion of the need to decarbonize the\npower sector and mining operations. Forget that on a per capita basis Todd\u2019s\nfridge consumes 2.6 times as much electricity as Liberia generates; or that\nper capita energy consumption is about a quarter of what it was in 1980. There\nis also almost no discussion of how current climate goals fit within Liberia\u2019s\ndevelopment strategy (although to be fair, this is partially on Liberian\npolicymakers). Finally, the preparation of a climate finance policy framework\nis prioritized \u2014 touching on everything from accessing foreign lending to\ndisaster risk financing to Central Bank regulations. The latter is likely to\nconsume valuable policymakers\u2019 time, while in the end doing little more than\nhanding over the country\u2019s land with no real impact on energy access and human\nwelfare.\n\nOverall, and as illustrated in the table above, the World Bank\u2019s foray into\nclimate change will merely crowd-in existing programs (e.g., WASH, gender,\ninfrastructure, etc) and infuse them with climate checkboxes. I am open to\npersuasion, but right now all of this looks and feels like rearranging the\ndeck chairs on the titanic.\n\n###\n\nIV: Conclusion\n\nLow-income countries would be better off if entities like the World Bank\nchampioned an aggressive Growth for the Climate agenda that explicitly\nprioritized the need to end (energy) poverty as a way to tackle climate\nchange. Such an approach, especially if coupled with growth-oriented bilateral\nenergy access programs (like the one proposed here), would be a more credible\nmeans of putting economies like Liberia\u2019s on a green path. Otherwise,\npoliticians will sign onto policy commitments that generate quick cash (and\nlots of conferences and workshops) in the short-term, but that will\nineluctably be abandoned on first contact with the realities of state capacity\n(both fiscal and administrative) and political incentives.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, it is up to politicians and policymakers in\nlow-income states to prioritize ending energy poverty. Their policy posture\nought to reflect an understanding that energy poverty kills people and jobs.\nThey should also understand that external actors will always seek to\nexternalize their own domestic priorities (it follows that multilaterals will\nreflect the priorities of those that fund/control them). The guiding principle\nshould be that growth and development today (on the back of reliable energy\naccess) is the best insurance against the impacts of climate change tomorrow.\n\nNotice that at current trends 560m Africans will still be without electricity\naccess in 2030.\n\nFor perspective, it\u2019s always worth recalling that \u201ceven if African countries\nwere to exploit all proven natural gas reserves, the region\u2019s emissions would\nstill only constitute 3.5% of the global total, against an 18% population\nshare.\u201d Which is to say that the region\u2019s prevailing policy mimicry around the\nglobal climate emergency is totally unwarranted.\n\nAn Africanist Perspective is a reader-supported publication.

I do not believe that\nthe West wants to save the planet by maintaining energy poverty in poor\ncountries. Their desire to fund carbon projects and alternative fuel\nproduction is driven by 1) the belief that these alternatives can deliver\nbenefits (improved cookstoves do deliver better health outcomes for users) and\nsolar PV products have brought electricity to places that would still be\nwaiting for grid access; and 2) the fossil fuel-based economy of the last 100\nyears has been good to some countries that are endowed with the resources but\nhas done little to address energy poverty in the vast majority of poor\ncountries that are not producers of it. In fact, even fossil fuel producers\nsuch as Angola, Nigeria and Gabon have alarmingly high levels of energy\npoverty. It is therefore debatable that continuing to rely on fossil fuel-\ndriven growth in most African countries is the way forward. Instead, fuels\nthat can be generated in situ (biogas) and fuels that have no cost (solar and\nwind) provide an opportunity for Africa to increase it energy consumption and\neconomic productivity. We should get the developed world to aggressively fund\nthe deployment of these resources in addition to the fossil fuel resources\nthat we do need to move up the energy consumption ladder.Expand full\ncommentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nPatrick Barry5 hrs agoI agree with much of the article, but for something\nrightly challenging the short sightedness of 'cookstoves', it feels about a\ndecade out of date.There's the simple fact that solar, especially, is simply\nthe cheapest energy source now and getting cheaper. If you need to build up a\ngrid and factories from scratch, it makes sense to do so around the solar\nsupply, not replicate grids that were designed around maximum baseload so that\ncapital intensive fuel burners were used efficiently. You have to take the\ncurrent economics seriously, otherwise it's cookstoves all over again, just a\nfew steps up the ladder.The second point, and I'd dearly love to read your\nthoughts on this, is the fossil debt trap as identified by Debnath et al in\nBangladesh. In the dash for energy growth, they took loans against expected\neconomic growth to build gas power plants. But now nearly all the increased\nrevenue is going on fuel and debt financing, and they're unable to afford to\ntransistion to a cheaper tech.
