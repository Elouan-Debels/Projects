We\u2019re very biased. You know, like Taylor Swift telling you to follow\n> your dreams is like a lottery winner saying, \u2018Liquidize your assets; buy\n> Powerball tickets - it works!\u2019\n>\n> Source\n\nTiling window managers in general are very \u201csticky\u201d pieces of software, and\nkomorebi is no exception. Once you start using it and it clicks, it becomes an\nessential part of how you interact with computers.\n\nMuch like notado.app and kullish, I will continue to develop komorebi\nregardless of the amount of financial sponsorship the project receives simply\nbecause I too am stuck in its stickiness! It is such an essential part of how\nI interact with my computer that I will always be compelled to develop it\nindefinitely.\n\nI am so grateful to every single person who has ever financially sponsored\nkomorebi. I wish I had more to give back to you for your support than just\nshout outs at the end of my YouTube videos.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments you can reach out to me on Twitter and\nMastodon.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in what I read to come up with software like komorebi,\nyou can subscribe to my Software Development RSS feed.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to watch me writing code while explaining what I\u2019m doing, you\ncan also subscribe to my YouTube channel.\n\nIf you found this content valuable, or if you are a happy user of the komorebi\ntiling window manager or my NixOS starter templates, please consider\nsponsoring me on GitHub or tipping me on Ko-fi.\n\nRead other posts\n\nSelectively Using Service Modules from NixOS Unstable \u2192\n\n\u00a9 2024 Powered by Hugo :: Theme made by panr\n\n", "frontpage": false}
