Instead, the recommended solution is a cloud-storage\nbackend, although taskchampion-sync-server is also available. See\nhttps://taskwarrior.org/docs/upgrade-3/ for information on upgrading to\nTaskwarrior 3.0.\n\nNote that this is a breaking upgrade: users must export their task database\nfrom 2.x and re-import it into 3.x. Hooks run during task import, so if you\nhave any hooks defined, temporarily disable them for this operation. See\n#3314.\n\nThis version also introduces Taskchampion, a new task-storage core for\nTaskwarrior written in Rust. Building Taskwarrior now requires a reasonably\nrecent version of the Rust toolchain (1.70.0).\n\nThe release consists of the following archives:\n\n    \n    \n    task-3.0.0.tar.gz (sha256 30f397081044f5dc2e5a0ba51609223011a23281cd9947ea718df98d149fcc83) Release tarball.
