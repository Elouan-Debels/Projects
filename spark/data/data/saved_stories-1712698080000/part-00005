However, increased computation power\nresults in higher energy dissipation, and energy efficiency is one of the key\nconcerns for IoT applications. In this paper, we explore adiabatic logic for\ndesigning an energy efficient configurable logic block (CLB) and compare it to\nthe CMOS counterpart. The simulation results show that the proposed adiabatic-\nlogic-based look-up table (LUT) has significant energy savings for the\nfrequency range of 1 MHz to 40 MHz, and the least energy savings is at 40 MHz,\nwhich is 92.94% energy reduction compared to its CMOS counterpart. Further,\nthe three proposed adiabatic-logic-based memory cells are 14T, 16T, and 12T\ndesigns with at least 88.2%, 84.2%, and 87.2% energy savings. Also, we\nevaluated the performance of the proposed CLBs using an adiabatic-logic-based\nLUT (AL-LUT) interfacing with adiabatic-logic-based memory cells. The proposed\ndesign shows significant energy reduction compared to a CMOS LUT interface\nwith SRAM cells for different frequencies; the energy savings are at least\n91.6% for AL-LUT 14T, 89.7% for AL-LUT 16T, and 91.3% AL-LUT 12T.\n\nKeywords:\n\nconfigurable logic block; energy efficiency; FPGA; adiabatic-logic-based LUT;\nadiabatic-logic-based memory cell; IoT\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm in which connected\ndevices exchange data among themselves over networks for complex IoT tasks. It\nis deeply integrated into our daily activities, from smart home applications\nemploying cameras and lighting systems to sophisticated healthcare solutions\nleveraging wearables and sensors [1,2,3,4]. A wide range of IoT applications\nraise the need for flexible and high-performance implementation. Field-\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGAs) are a promising solution that provides great\ncomputing power and flexibility. An FPGA consists of configurable logic blocks\n(CLB), routing blocks, and I/O ports, which allows designers to tailor\nfunctionality to specific application needs. Furthermore, an FPGA provides\nnumerous I/O ports that meet the communication requirements of different IoT\napplications. Also, the infinite reconfigurability of FPGAs provides great\nflexibility and short time-to-market [5,6,7,8,9,10].\n\nEven with the many benefits of FPGAs, the energy efficiency of FPGA-based IoT\napplications continues to be one of the major concerns. It is made worse by\nthe limited resources of IoT devices [11,12]. Many existing research studies\npresent micro-architectural approaches to improve the energy efficiency of\nFPGAs, so it is beneficial to investigate energy efficient techniques at the\ncircuit or system level [13,14]. Adiabatic logic is one such technique for\ndesigning energy efficient circuits. Adiabatic-logic-based circuits can\neffectively reduce the dynamic energy dissipation and recycle the charges from\nthe load capacitance. Many adiabatic logic families, such as efficient charge\nrecovery logic (ECRL) and positive feedback adiabatic logic (PFAL), show\nsignificant energy saving at low frequency ranges [15,16,17,18]. The low\nfrequency required for IoT applications makes adiabatic logic a promising\ncandidate for hardware implementation of IoT applications and low-frequency\nFPGAs [19,20].\n\nSince the main component of an FPGA is the CLB, we investigate the\neffectiveness and feasibility of applying adiabatic logic to improve the\nenergy efficiency of CLBs. Our proposed designs include an adiabatic-logic-\nbased look-up table (AL-LUT) and adiabatic-logic-based memory cells for\nconstructing the CLB. We present a comprehensive analysis conducted through\nthe Cadence Spectre simulator to evaluate the viability of these designs.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of designing energy efficient\nCLBs using adiabatic logic. The primary contributions of this study are\noutlined as follows:\n\n  * We propose three adiabatic-logic-based memory cells, which are a 14T design, 16T design, and 12T design.\n\n  * We propose an adiabatic-logic-based LUT that can interface different memories such as SRAM cells and adiabatic-logic-based memory cells.\n\n  * We present case studies using an adiabatic-logic-based LUT and adiabatic-logic-based memory cells to build a CLB.\n\n  * We conduct a comparative analysis of the proposed designs against their CMOS counterpart.\n\n  * We also demonstrate that the proposed designs are significantly energy efficient.\n\n  * We finally conclude that designing a CLB with adiabatic logic is a viable solution for energy-constrained IoT applications.\n\nThis article is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the essential\ninformation of FPGA and adiabatic logic. Section 3 describes our proposed\nadiabatic-logic-based LUT and adiabatic-logic-based memory cells. Section 4\nincludes the simulation results and discussion, and Section 5 concludes the\narticle.\n\n## 2\\. Background\n\nThis section provides a brief background of SRAM-based FPGAs and adiabatic\nlogic. Here, we explain the architecture of SRAM-based FPGAs and the structure\nof a CLB. Further, we present the functionality principles of the LUT and\nmemory cells, which are the building blocks of the CLB. Finally, we discuss\nthe adiabatic logic\u2019s energy reduction, charge recycling mechanism, and power\nclock scheme.\n\n#### 2.1. SRAM-Based Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)\n\nSRAM-based FPGAs have gained much attention in the commercial and academic\ndomains. They stand out due to their flexibility and capability to be\ndynamically reconfigured, which enable designers to implement custom logic\nfunctions and algorithms suited to specific applications, unlike application-\nspecific integrated circuits (ASICs), which have fixed functionality. These\nfeatures of FPGAs allow designers to develop and test their prototype designs\nand reduce the time-to-market period [5,21]. Figure 1 presents the structure\nof an SRAM-based FPGA, where the blue blocks are the CLB, the yellow blocks\nare the switch block, the green blocks are the I/O port, and the parallel\nlines are the interconnect [22]. Switch blocks and interconnects are used in\nan SRAM-based FPGA to pass the signals between different CLBs. The other\nfundamental building block of the FPGA is the CLB. The CLB mainly consists of\nthree parts: (1) look-up table (LUT), (2) flip flops, and (3) SRAM cells\n[21,23].\n\nFigure 1. The structure of an SRAM-based FPGA.\n\nThe LUT consists of a tree-like multiplexer and an array of SRAM cells. Figure\n2 shows the basic structure of the LUT and SRAM cell in an FPGA [23,24]. When\nthe designer programs the SRAM-based FPGA, SRAM cells store the configuration\ndata of the logic function and routing data of the connections between CLBs.\nOnce inputs are applied to the LUT, the LUT decodes the inputs to select the\ncorresponding SRAM cell. The value in the SRAM cell is amplified as the output\nof the LUT.\n\nFigure 2. The structure of the circuit: (a) CMOS LUT and (b) SRAM in FPGA,\nwhere is the input and is its complement, and is the configuration data (n =\n1, 2 ...4 and m = 1, 2 ...16).\n\n#### 2.2. Adiabatic Logic\n\nAdiabatic logic refers to a specialized technique in digital circuit design\nthat seeks to minimize energy consumption. Adiabatic-logic-based circuits use\na slowly rising and falling power clock, which is sinusoidal in this study due\nto its less complex design and routing. This feature allows the adiabatic-\nlogic-based circuit to minimize the energy loss due to the voltage differences\nbetween two nodes and recover the charges from the load capacitors [15].\nFigure 3 illustrates the charging and discharging model for the adiabatic-\nlogic-based circuit in each phase. Typically, the adiabatic-logic-based\ncircuit works in two phases: (i) In the evaluation phase, the power clock\nrises from the ground () to full swing () and charges up one of the output\nnodes through the logic tree F or ; (ii) the power clock falls from to in the\nrecovery phase. Due to the voltage difference, the current flows from the\noutput node to the power clock, leading to charge recovery. Those recovered\ncharges are reused in the next evaluation. The energy dissipation is shown as\nfollows:\n\nwhere is the full swing of the power clock, C is the load capacitance, R is\nthe transistor\u2019s parasitic resistance, and T is the charging/discharging time\nof the load capacitor. Compared to conventional CMOS, the adiabatic-logic-\nbased circuit consumes less energy when T 2.\n\nFigure 3. Adiabatic logic charging and discharging model.\n\n## 3\\. Proposed Adiabatic-Logic-Based Design\n\nTo investigate the benefits of applying adiabatic logic to a CLB, we design an\nadiabatic-logic-based LUT. Then, we explore the adiabatic-logic-based memory\ncells for additional energy reduction. We also build a CLB using adiabatic-\nlogic-based LUT with SRAM cells or adiabatic-logic-based memory cells.\nFinally, two case studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the\nproposed designs. All the proposed designs are simulated and compared to their\nCMOS counterpart.\n\n#### 3.1. Adiabatic-Logic-Based Look-Up-Table (LUT) for Configurable Logic\nBlock (CLB)\n\nUnlike CMOS LUT, an adiabatic-logic-based LUT (AL-LUT) works with a power\nclock that varies from full swing () to ground (). Once the AL-LUT decodes the\ninput and selects the SRAM cell with a logic value \u20181\u2019 (), it will lead to a\nshort circuit as the power clock is at . To avoid a short circuit between the\npower clock and SRAM cells, we use SRAM cells to drive the NMOS in a tree-like\nmultiplexer. This allows the tree-like multiplexer to function in the proper\nadiabatic logic manner. Our previous design in [25], which is an adiabatic-\nlogic-based sense amplifier (AL-SA), has been used to properly sense and\namplify the value in the SRAM cell. Therefore, the proposed AL-LUT consists of\na 5-bit tree-like multiplexer and an AL-SA, as shown in Figure 4. The 5-bit\ntree-like multiplexer has four select bits ( - and - ), and the fifth bit is\nthe configurable bit from the SRAM cells. The function block F and its\ncomplementary have been used on the side of the AL-SA. AL-LUT decodes the\ninputs, and the power clock charges one of the output nodes of the AL-SA\nthrough F or . Later, the AL-SA further pulls up the node as the power clock\nrises to . The waveform of a 16:1 AL-LUT is illustrated in Figure 5, and the\ndetailed evaluation operation is as follows:\n\nFigure 4. The schematic of the proposed adiabatic-logic-based LUT. The core\ncircuit is shown in the dashed-line box, where is the input and is its\ncomplement, and are the configuration data and are their complements (n = 1, 2\n...4 and m = 1, 2 ...16).\n\nFigure 5. Example of the adiabatic-logic-based LUT\u2019s operation ( and are\nconstant, and PC is the power clock).\n\n  * Pre-evaluation: At time = , a sense enable () signal is applied to the access transistors ( and ) of the AL-SA. and connect the AL-SA with the logic trees F and . Since all inputs are valid, one of the logic trees is ON, which connects one of the output nodes of the AL-SA to the power clock.\n\n  * Evaluation: Between time and , the voltage of the power clock () begins rising, and remains at logic value \u20181\u2019 until time = . Assuming the logic tree F is ON, the power clock pulls the node up as it rises. The increased voltage of the node turns ON, which results in the node at the . However, is below the threshold voltage of the PMOS (), and remains inactive.\n\n  * Amplifying: At time = , the signal is set to logic value \u20180\u2019. and are OFF, disconnecting the output nodes of the AL-SA from the logic tree F and . After time = , is ON, which causes AL-SA to pull the node up to , while pulls the node down to .\n\nAfter the power clock reaches , AL-LUT starts recovering the charges from the\nload capacitors. The load capacitance charges are recovered through to the\npower clock during this phase. The details of the recovery process are as\nfollows:\n\n  * Recovering: At time = , falls from . Hence, is lower than the voltage of the node. Due to the potential difference, the current flows from the node to the power clock through .\n\n  * Idle: At time = , reaches ; this results in turning OFF . Therefore, the discharge process of the adiabatic-logic-based LUT is stopped, and the voltage of the node remains at . The AL-LUT ends the charge recovery process after falls below .\n\n#### 3.2. Proposed Adiabatic-Logic-Based Memory Cell\n\nTo further reduce energy dissipation, we explored using an adiabatic-logic-\nbased memory cell to replace the SRAM cell in the FPGA. Figure 6 shows the\nbasic block of the proposed adiabatic-logic-based memory cell, which has two\noperation modes: hold mode and write mode. The circuit mode depends on the\ninputs of and . If the inputs of and are at logic value \u20180\u2019, the circuit is in\nhold mode. If the logic values of the inputs of and are complementary, the\ncircuit is in write mode. In write mode, based on the values of the inputs of\nand , one of these NMOSs is ON and connects its corresponding output to the\npower clock (), and the data will be latched in the core circuit. After each\nwrite or hold operation, the output node with logic value \u20181\u2019 is discharged\nthrough the PMOS ( or ). However, the PMOS transistors can not discharge to\nlogic value \u20180\u2019 in a full-swing manner since they will be OFF for the gate to\nsource voltages below . Accordingly, there will be some residual charge in one\nof the output nodes of the core circuit. We assume the node has logic value\n\u20180\u2019 and the node has logic value \u20181\u2019 in the first clock cycle (from t0 to t1).\nTherefore, cannot completely discharge the node, and some residual charge\nremains at this node. In the next clock cycle, if the circuit is in hold mode,\nthe power clock starts rising from the toward , and turns ON faster than due\nto those residual charges. Accordingly, the core circuit sets the node as\nlogic value \u20181\u2019 and the node as logic value \u20180\u2019. Figure 7 shows the waveform\nof the basic block of the proposed adiabatic-logic-based memory cell. In this\nfigure, the logic values of \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 are written into the memory cell\u2019s and\nnodes, respectively. In the next two clock cycles, no new input is applied to\nthe circuit, and the circuit is in hold mode, which leads to repeated outputs.\n\nFigure 6. The structure of the basic block of the proposed adiabatic-logic-\nbased memory cell, where PC is the power clock.\n\nFigure 7. The waveform of the basic block of the proposed adiabatic-logic-\nbased memory cell. When no inputs are applied to the basic block, it generates\nthe repeated output after time = t1.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Figure 6 is a basic block, and the actual proposed\nadiabatic-logic-based memory cell designs will be presented in the following\nsection.\n\nSince adiabatic logic works in a pipeline fashion, we can cascade the\nadiabatic-logic-based memory cell to build a 16-bit memory cell with a two-\nphase sinusoidal power clock scheme. However, cascading the adiabatic-logic-\nbased memory cells will result in a synchronization issue. For the adiabatic-\nlogic-based circuit, the output is only valid during a certain period of the\nclock cycle: typically when the power clock is at logic value \u20181\u2019 or . Again,\nthe 16-bit memory cell requires two power clocks for proper operation, which\nleads to invalid output from half of the memory cells. However, AL-LUT\nrequires all valid outputs from the memory cell during the evaluation phase.\nTherefore, 16:1 AL-LUT cannot generate proper outputs when interfacing with a\n16-bit adiabatic-logic-based memory cell. Figure 8a shows a 16:1 AL-LUT\ninterfacing with a 16-bit adiabatic-logic-based memory cell ( is power clock 0\nand is power clock 1 at a 180-degree phase shift). AL-LUT is connected to ,\nand the 16-bit adiabatic-logic-based memory cell is connected to both power\nclocks ( and ). Here, the odd cells (, , , ..., ) are connected to , and the\neven cells (, , , ..., ) are connected to . When the AL-LUT performs the\nevaluation, starts rising from , and is at . Therefore, the even cells have\nvalid outputs, and the odd cells do not have valid outputs since the odd cells\nare in the evaluation phase. These invalid outputs from the odd cells result\nin false evaluation of the AL-LUT.\n\nFigure 8. Illustration of the 16:1 AL-LUT interfaced with the 16-bit\nadiabatic-logic-based memory cell: (a) Synchronization issue due to invalid\noutput from the memory cell. (b) The proposed solution for solving the\nsynchronization issue.\n\nTo resolve this synchronization issue, we need to duplicate the adiabatic-\nlogic-based memory cell to provide valid outputs for the AL-LUT. As shown in\nFigure 8b, we include another adiabatic-logic-based memory cell to form the\nnew 1-bit memory cell. Hence, the new 1-bit memory cell has two copies of the\ndata (where one copy is stored in the even cell, and the other is stored in\nthe odd cell). Since the AL-LUT is connected to and the odd cell in the new\n1-bit memory cell is connected to , the odd cell can provide valid output to\nthe AL-LUT. Therefore, we can cascade the new 1-bit memory cell to build the\n16-bit adiabatic-logic-based memory cell for the 16:1 AL-LUT.\n\nDuring the writing process of the 16-bit adiabatic-logic-based memory cell,\nall data are written to the first memory cell (), and it propagates the data\nthrough the rest of the memory cells. After the last data are written to , the\nwriting process ends, and no inputs will be applied to the 16-bit adiabatic-\nlogic-based memory cell. However, the data in will continue propagating\nthrough the rest of the memory cells, resulting in all the memory cells having\nthe same data as . Hence, we propose three adiabatic-logic-based memory cells\nto stop the propagating after the last data are written.\n\n#### 3.2.1. Proposed 14T Adiabatic-Logic-Based Memory Cell\n\nThe proposed 14T adiabatic-logic-based memory cell is illustrated in Figure\n9a. It consists of for storing the data and [18] for supplying output to the\nAL-LUT. has two pairs of NMOS (, and , ) for controlling the writing process.\nand stop the propagation after the writing process is completed, and and are\nused to prevent the input nodes of and from floating in hold mode.\n\nFigure 9. Proposed 1-bit adiabatic-logic-based memory cell: (a) 14T adiabatic-\nlogic-based memory cell, (b) 16T adiabatic-logic-based memory cell, and (c)\n12T adiabatic-logic-based memory cell.\n\nThe writing process begins when the Enable (EN) signal is applied to the\nenable transistors ( and ) of while the Hold signal is at logic value \u20180\u2019. The\nenable transistors pass the inputs ( and ) to the input transistors ( and ).\nAssuming is at logic value \u20181\u2019 and is at logic value \u20180\u2019, these set \u2019s node as\nlogic value \u20181\u2019 and node as logic value \u20180\u2019. Therefore, stores the data, which\ncompletes the writing process. Meanwhile, the EN is set to logic value \u20180\u2019 to\nturn and OFF, and Hold is set to logic value \u20181\u2019 to turn ON and . and pull the\ninput nodes of and to , ensuring the correct functionality of the 14T memory\ncell. Further, the outputs from lead to set its node as logic value \u20181\u2019 and\nnode as logic value \u20180\u2019 when starts rising from . provides the valid output to\nAL-LUT when reaches . It is noteworthy that also acts as a buffer, and unlike\nits CMOS counterpart, the proposed 14T memory cell does not need a buffer\ncircuit as an interface with the LUTs.\n\n#### 3.2.2. Proposed 16T Adiabatic-Logic-Based Memory Cell\n\nThe 16T adiabatic-logic-based memory cell (Figure 9b) has two AL-SA-based\nmemory cells ( and ). The AL-SA-based memory cell adopts the AL-LUT design and\nconsists of an AL-SA with an extra pair of NMOSs ( and ). The extra pair of\nNMOSs are the input transistors, and and are the access transistors. The\nwriting process of the proposed 16T memory cell is similar to that of the AL-\nLUT. We assume the inputs and are at logic values \u20181\u2019 and \u20180\u2019, respectively.\nis set to logic value \u20181\u2019 for a short amount of time and will be applied to to\nenable the writing process. charges up the node in through and , storing the\ndata in . It further amplifies the data after is set to logic value \u20180\u2019.\nSimilarly, evaluates and stores the data when is applied. After is set to\nlogic value \u20180\u2019, the writing process ends, and further amplifies the data. In\nhold mode, and remain at logic value \u20180\u2019 to avoid altering the data in and .\nTherefore, and generate repeated outputs while the circuit is in hold mode.\nAlso, like the proposed 14T memory cell, the proposed 16T memory cell does not\nneed a buffer as an interface with LUT, and acts as a buffer, too.\n\n#### 3.2.3. Proposed 12T Adiabatic-Logic-Based Memory Cell\n\nAdiabatic logic is dual-rail in nature, leading to an increase in the circuit\nsize compared to its CMOS counterpart. Reducing the memory cell size will\nresult in an overall area reduction when designing the CLB. Therefore, we\npropose a 12T adiabatic-logic-based memory cell by replacing in the 16T memory\ncell with from the 14T memory cell. Figure 9c shows the schematic of the 12T\nmemory cell. In the 12T memory cell, stores the data, and supplies output to\nthe AL-LUT.\n\nDuring the write operation of the 12T memory cell, is set to for a short\namount of time and is then applied to . Based on the inputs, one side of the\noutput nodes of will be pulled up by . Later, the data are latched into , and\nis set to logic value \u20180\u2019. Further, the output will be amplified by , which\ncompletes the writing process. When reaches , the output of becomes valid for\n. Therefore, will generate the proper output for the AL-LUT. After writing the\ndata into the memory cell, remains at the logic value \u20180\u2019 to stop propagating\nthe data to the other memory cells. It is noteworthy that, like the other\nproposed memory cell in this paper, the proposed 12T memory cell does not need\nbuffer circuitry as an interface with LUT.\n\n## 4\\. Simulation Results and Discussion\n\nThe proposed designs and their counterpart are investigated and compared in\nthis section. The schematic was created with TSMC 65 nm using Cadence Virtuoso\nand simulated using Cadence Spectre. In order to eliminate the effects of the\ninitial conditions of the circuits, the configurations of the CLBs are written\non the proposed memory cells and their CMOS counterpart. It is noteworthy that\nthe results of this process have not been taken into account in the reported\nresults. Further, the energy performance of all the designs is evaluated by\nenergy per cycle for this study.\n\n#### 4.1. Proposed Adiabatic-Logic-Based LUT\n\nThe simulation results and comparison of the proposed adiabatic-logic-based\nLUT and its CMOS counterpart have been investigated. The simulation results\nare listed in Table 1 for the frequency range from 1 MHz to 40 MHz. The\nresults show that the AL-LUT has significantly less energy dissipation than\nits CMOS counterpart. The energy consumption of the COMS LUT ranges from 196.9\nfJ to 13.18 fJ, and the proposed adiabatic-logic-based LUT ranges from 13.79\nfJ to 0.931 fJ. Figure 10 shows the energy saving of the proposed design\ncompared to its CMOS counterpart for different frequencies. The proposed AL-\nLUT has a minimum savings of 92.94% at 40 MHz and a maximum savings of 93.67%\nat 12.5 MHz. Further, the energy savings are relatively consistent across the\n1 to 40 MHz range.\n\nFigure 10. The energy savings of the proposed adiabatic-logic-based memory\ndesign compared to the CMOS LUT at different frequencies.\n\nTable 1. Energy performance (fJ/cycle) comparison for proposed 16:1 adiabatic-\nlogic-based LUT design at different frequencies.\n\n#### 4.2. Proposed Adiabatic-Logic-Based Memory Cells\n\nThe energy consumption of the proposed adiabatic-logic-based memory cells for\n16-bit memory is presented in Table 2. The results show that all proposed\nadiabatic-logic-based memory cells consume significantly less energy compared\nto the SRAM cell. For example, the SRAM cell dissipates 37.25 fJ at 12.5 MHz.\nThe energy consumptions of the proposed designs at this frequency are 3.872\nfJ, 4.823 fJ, and 4.041 fJ for the 14T memory cell, the 16T memory cell, and\nthe 12T memory cell, respectively. The proposed 14T memory cell has the lowest\nenergy consumption among the three proposed designs. Figure 11 shows the\nenergy savings of the proposed 16-bit adiabatic-logic-based memory cells. The\nresults show the energy savings for all of the proposed memory cells. In the\nfrequency range of 1 MHz to 40 MHz, the maximum and minimum energy savings of\nthe three proposed designs are 90.2% and 84.2%, respectively. The best energy\nsavings are reached at 1 MHz for all of the proposed designs. At 1 MHz, the\nenergy savings are 90.2% for the 14T memory cell, 88.2% for the 16T memory\ncell, and 90.0% for the 12T memory cell.\n\nFigure 11. The energy savings of the proposed adiabatic-logic-based memory\ndesign compared to the CMOS-based SRAM at different frequencies.\n\nTable 2. Energy performance (fJ/cycle) comparison for proposed 16-bit\nadiabatic-logic-based memory cell at different frequencies.\n\n#### 4.3. Case Study: Combining Proposed Adiabatic-Logic-Based LUT with SRAM\nCell and Proposed Adiabatic-Logic-Based Memory Cells for Building CLB\n\nTo better understand the performance of the proposed designs using adiabatic\nlogic, different CLBs using an SRAM cell and the proposed memory cells\ncombined with AL-LUT and CMOS LUT (C-LUT) are simulated. Different simulated\ncombinations of memory cells and LUTs to build different CLBs are shown in\nTable 3.\n\nTable 3. Case study: building the CLB with the adiabatic-logic-based LUT and\nthe different memory cells.\n\n#### 4.3.1. Proposed Adiabatic-Logic-Based LUT with Different Memory Cells at\nDifferent Frequencies\n\nThe energy consumption of the different designs is listed in Table 4. Even in\nthe case of only using AL-LUT instead of C-LUT and combining it with SRAM\ncells (AL-LUT with SRAM), the energy consumption is reduced compared to C-LUT\nwith SRAM. In addition, using the proposed adiabatic memory cells alongside\nthe AL-LUT to implement the CLB reduces energy consumption even further. For\nexample, at 12.5 MHz, the energy consumptions of C-LUT with SRAM and AL-LUT\nwith SRAM are 61.19 fJ and 42.46 fJ, respectively. Also, at 12.5 MHz, the AL-\nLUT with 14T, AL-LUT with 16T, and AL-LUT with 12T designs use 5.04 fJ, 5.992\nfJ, and 5.21 fJ, respectively, which is significantly lower than the energy\nconsumption of AL-LUT with SRAM and C-LUT with SRAM. Also, comparing the\nenergy consumption of AL-LUT with SRAM and CLBs using AL-LUT and adiabatic-\nlogic-based memory cells shows the crucial role of the adiabatic-logic-based\nmemory cells in maximizing energy savings. It is also noteworthy that this\nsignificant reduction in energy consumption is achieved across all frequencies\nfrom 1 MHz to 40 MHz.\n\nTable 4. Energy performance (fJ/cycle) comparison for proposed 16:1 adiabatic-\nlogic-based LUT with different memory cells at different frequencies.\n\nFigure 12 shows the energy savings of the proposed designs compared to C-LUT\nwith SRAM. The energy savings of AL-LUT with SRAM varies from 17.71% to 48.29%\nat the frequency range of 1 MHz to 40 MHz. It achieves more energy savings as\nthe frequency increases. However, it has significantly lower energy savings\nthan the other proposed designs. For example, the CLB designs with AL-LUT and\nadiabatic-logic-based memories have relatively consistent energy savings of\naround 91% across the frequencies from 1 MHz to 40 MHz compared to C-LUT with\nSRAM. Among the proposed designs, AL-LUT with 14T has the best energy saving.\n\nFigure 12. The energy savings of the 16:1 adiabatic-logic-based LUT with\ndifferent memory designs compared to the CMOS-based LUT with SRAM cells at\ndifferent frequencies.\n\n#### 4.3.2. Proposed Adiabatic-Logic-Based LUT with Memory Cells with\nDifferent Supply Voltage\n\nIn order to investigate the effects of different supply voltage values on the\nproposed designs, the designs in Table 3 are simulated with different power\nsupply voltages. Table 5 presents the energy consumption of the five designs\nat 12.5 MHz. All proposed designs consume significantly less energy than their\nCMOS counterpart in the voltage range of 1.2 V to 0.7 V. As expected, AL-LUT\nwith SRAM has significantly less energy savings compared to the AL-LUT\ninterfacing with the proposed adiabatic-logic-based memory cells.\n\nTable 5. Energy performance (fJ/cycle) comparison for proposed 16:1 adiabatic-\nlogic-based LUT with different memories using different supply voltages.\n\nFigure 13 shows the energy savings of the proposed designs compared to their\nCMOS counterpart with supply voltages ranging from 1.2 V to 0.7 V. At 0.7 V,\nthe energy saving of AL-LUT with SRAM is 28.2%, which is significantly lower\nenergy savings compared to the other proposed CLB designs. For example, also\nat 0.7 V, AL-LUT with 14T is 89.8%, AL-LUT with 16T is 89.4%, and AL-LUT with\n12T is 90.7%. Further, the simulation results show that the energy savings of\nall of the proposed designs slightly decreases as the supply voltage\ndecreases, but the difference is negligible. Hence, it can be concluded that\nthe energy savings across the voltage range from 1.2 V to 0.7 V is almost\nconsistent.\n\nFigure 13. The energy savings of the 16:1 adiabatic-logic-based LUT with\ndifferent memory designs compared to the CMOS-based LUT with SRAM cells using\ndifferent supply voltages.\n\nIn order to compare the area overhead of the proposed designs and their\ncounterpart, transistor count is used as the metric. Table 6 shows the\ntransistor count of the 16:1 LUT designs. Since adiabatic logic is usually\ndesigned in a dual-rail fashion, it has double the transistor count compared\nto CMOS-based logic, as indicated by the results in Table 6 for LUT designs.\nOn the other hand, the proposed memory cells in this paper have fewer\ntransistors compared to their counterpart (SRAM cells in FPGAs). Accordingly,\nthe results in Table 6 show that all proposed CLBs in this paper have fewer\ntransistors compared to their CMOS counterpart, and AL-LUT with 16T, 14T, and\n12T reduce the transistor count by 19.40%, 21.36%, and 35.32%, respectively.\n\nTable 6. Transistor count of CLB using proposed 16:1 adiabatic-logic-based LUT\ndesign with different memories and its CMOS counterpart.\n\n## 5\\. Conclusions\n\nIn this article, we utilized adiabatic logic to improve the energy efficiency\nof a CLB. We proposed a 16:1 adiabatic-logic-based LUT (AL-LUT). The proposed\nAL-LUT shows significant energy savings compared to its CMOS counterpart.\nHowever, the overall energy savings of AL-LUT was significantly reduced when\nincluding the energy of the SRAM cell. We explored adiabatic logic and\ndesigned a memory cell for further energy savings. Three proposed adiabatic-\nlogic-based memory cells are 14T, 16T, and 12T designs. The proposed memory\ncells show significant energy savings compared to their CMOS counterparts.\nAlso, the energy savings significantly increase by using the proposed memory\ncells alongside the AL-LUT compared to the CMOS counterpart and the AL-LUT and\nSRAM cell. This comparison shows the significant impact of using adiabatic-\nlogic-based memory cells on the energy savings of CLBs. We conducted two case\nstudies with frequency sweep and voltage sweep to investigate the performance\nof AL-LUT with different memories at different frequencies and supply\nvoltages. Both studies indicate that AL-LUT with the proposed memory cells\nshows significant energy reduction. Our study concludes that the proposed AL-\nLUT and memory cell are viable solutions to help FPGAs meet the energy\nrequirements of IoT applications.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, W.Y. and H.T.; Data curation, W.Y.; Formal analysis, W.Y.\nand M.T.N.; Funding acquisition, H.T.; Investigation, W.Y. and H.T.;\nMethodology, W.Y. and M.T.N.; Project administration, H.T.; Resources, H.T.;\nSoftware, W.Y. and M.T.N.; Supervision, H.T.; Validation, W.Y.;\nWriting\u2014original draft, W.Y. and M.T.N.; Writing\u2014review and editing, H.T. and\nM.T.N.
