SIGN UP HERE>\n\nWhen I wrote about Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance at the Ambani pre-wedding\ncelebration last month, I may have skimmed over how much business was going on\nin the background. That\u2019s not to say Zuckerberg was sweating over a\ncounteroffer while Rihanna danced in the background, but this week saw\nunconfirmed reports that Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries may host Meta\u2019s first\ndata center in India, another significant win for the omnipresent mogul.\n\nThen, there\u2019s Ambani\u2019s business with Disney CEO Bob Iger. The day before the\ncelebration launched, Disney and Reliance announced plans to merge their\nIndian television and streaming assets. If confirmed, it brings together the\ncompanies behind the country\u2019s two biggest streaming apps: Reliance\u2019s\nJioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar. Rest of World\u2019s Ananya Bhattacharya already\ntook a closer look at the new streaming giant, but the biggest takeaway is\njust how many more subscribers those two apps have in India than Netflix.\nJioCinema has over three times as many Indian users as Netflix, and Disney+\nHotstar has over 10 times as many \u2014 a whopping 333 million users.\n\nSnapping up the rights to stream lucrative live sporting events is one of the\nreasons the Indian apps are ahead, but the biggest difference is that they\nhave partnerships and corporate tie-ins that make the service easy to use for\nfree. Add in a lower sticker price, and it\u2019s such an overwhelming advantage in\nthe Indian market that it makes the whole comparison seem almost unfair.\nNetflix\u2019s pricing model is just poorly suited to what Indian consumers want \u2014\nand as long as it\u2019s charging customers $6 a month, it\u2019s going to be outflanked\nby local competitors.\n\nSign up to our weekly newsletter featuring the latest on U.S. tech giants and\ntheir impact outside the West.\n\nIt\u2019s an important test case for Netflix as the company enters into a new\nphase. We\u2019re far past the software-as-a-service days when Netflix had an\nactual advantage in streaming video online, an advantage that scaled\nrelatively smoothly across regions. Now, Netflix\u2019s main advantage is its\nlibrary and the sheer volume of money it can invest in content. A $250 billion\nmarket cap means it can overwhelm the local entertainment industry, even in\ncountries like South Korea that already have well-developed studio systems.\n\nBut throwing money around isn\u2019t always enough. In one recent case, Netflix\npaid top dollar to hire the comedy star Kapil Sharma \u2014 only for his fan base\nto declare the new show too expensive to watch. Netflix\u2019s strategy may result\nin a healthy library of local content and an industry reputation as a big\nspender, but if it doesn\u2019t translate into new subscriptions, it will be hard\nto gain too much of a foothold. The same dynamic is already playing out in\nAfrica, where Netflix was recently outpaced by the local rival Showmax.\n\nTo be fair, none of this is an immediate problem for Netflix. Premium pricing\nmeans more money, even without massive subscriber growth, and the company is\nworth more than it\u2019s ever been. Ad-supported rivals like Meta and Google took\na beating when ad markets cratered earlier this year, which made investors\nlove Netflix\u2019s approach that much more.\n\nBut the Indian test case suggests there are real limits to how much Netflix\ncan grow outside the West \u2014 at least without real changes. In the long term,\nNetflix is facing off against Disney to be the first truly global content\nstudio \u2014 and winning over markets like India is an important step on the\njourney. With the Reliance deal, Netflix has been outflanked.\n\nThis essay was originally published in our Exporter newsletter.
