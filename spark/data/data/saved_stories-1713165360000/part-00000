I want to go over his concerns one by one and give some\nassessment of how accurate and important I think they are. Rabble\u2019s words in\nitalics; my responses in just normal text.\n\n  * User identities are tied to a server. This is only partially true; your user identity is tied to a domain, not a server. But most servers only handle one domain, and most people don\u2019t move their domains between servers. We have a section on domain portability between servers on the ActivityPub Data Portability report. Using domains is also how much of the Internet works. Email addresses are tied to a domain; Web sites are tied to a domain. You can move the domain between different implementations transparently. It\u2019s a really robust architecture that has stood the test of time for almost 50 years.\n  * Users can\u2019t migrate between servers. Partially true. Rabble covers the essentials; you can move followers and not much else. It\u2019s also possible to move your \u201cstuff\u201d between identities; that\u2019s most of what our Data Portability task force is working on.\n  * On a single server, it is impossible to change your username! Somewhat true. ActivityPub identities are URLs like https://social.example/user/vtles1XgZkPUEulBsFmRX . That identity URL is immutable; you can\u2019t change it. Some implementations include a username in that url, like https://other.example/user/evanp. With that kind of server software, it\u2019s true, you can\u2019t change the username. Also, we use a standard called Webfinger that maps an identity string like username@domain to an URL. You can read about it in the ActivityPub Webfinger report. Some servers use that string, instead of the ActivityPub ID, as the unique ID for a remote user. That\u2019s discouraged, but if someone does that, changing your user ID will make you no longer findable for those other servers. I think as we stabilize our use of WebFinger, some of these usages are going to get better.\n  * Fediverse servers have total control over your account and data. True. This is the \u201cfederation\u201d part of the fediverse. It\u2019s how Web sites and email work. Don\u2019t use a fediverse server without a good trust relationship with your server admin; ideally someone you have a business relationship with, or your employer, or your university. Same goes for email! It also means that if you control your own server, you have total control over your account and data. That\u2019s a feature, not a bug. Another option is using a cooperative server, like cosocial.ca or social.coop. A cooperative is a legal structure in which members pay for and manage their own service. I think cooperatives are awesome.\n  * The fediverse is a network of fiefdoms, each server admin having total control over their users. This seems about the same as the previous statement, but OK. I think the key strength of the fediverse here is that we can have dozens of different models for server governance \u2014 coops, enterprises, city libraries, family servers, individual servers. That level of experimentation is a feature, not a bug. Governance is not baked into the protocol.\n  * Each kind of fediverse server is isolated. This one is just plain wrong. ActivityPub is based on an open data standard called Activity Streams 2.0 (AS2) which models social data. There is an extensive standard vocabulary that can represent Web content like text, images, video and audio, and the social graph, but also well-known social interactions like check-ins, events, and groups. More importantly, Activity Streams 2.0 is extensible, meaning you can add properties to existing types, or whole new types of objects or interactions. And every ActivityPub server is built to handle AS2. What is true is that we have had a lot of servers that only handle a subset of the AS2 vocabulary, and reject content they don\u2019t know how to handle. This is mostly due to mimicking the siloed social networks; we\u2019ve gotten used to thinking of different social networks for different kinds of content. I think this is changing, especially as new kinds of content hit the network. Developers are just learning how to effectively handle extension content with fallback representations. I look forward to this improving over time.\n  * The fediverse has no privacy; there is no system of end-to-end encrypted messaging. The first part is false; you can mark your posts as followers-only, or directed to a single person, or a group of people. Servers enforce this privacy. You can also mark that you don\u2019t want your public posts to be indexable or your public account to be discoverable. However, the second part is true; we don\u2019t have end-to-end encryption. So, if you send a private message to someone on another server, you message can be read by both your admin and their admin. It\u2019s stored in the clear on both servers. This is also how email works, as well as most direct messages on commercial social networks. However, it\u2019s something worth working on. I\u2019ve sketched out an architecture for end-to-end encryption over ActivityPub, and I\u2019ve got a proposal out to work on it for Summer of Protocols. I think it will be good to level this up!\n  * The fediverse has no system for micropayments. This is true. The fediverse is also first and foremost for social networking \u2014 connecting to friends, family, colleagues and neighbours. Most of these interactions are not mediated by payment; in fact, payment cheapens those interactions. However, there are other relationship types on the fediverse \u2014 supporting creators, journalists, or publishers. The main way to do this today is with paid subscriptions; for example, you can subscribe to evanplus@prodromou.pub to get access to premium content I publish. You have to send me US$5 out-of-band or I won\u2019t approve the follow; that\u2019s the state of play right now on the fediverse. I think in-band payments are kind of cool for this kind of work, as well as for marketplaces \u2014 buying and selling services or goods over the fediverse. I think the easiest structure is adding payment URLs like a PayPal account, or blockchain wallets like a Bitcoin Lightning address.\n  * Lastly, and most importantly for me, the culture of fediverse server admins and developers is vindictive. I don\u2019t think this is the case; I love the culture of the fediverse, which is playful, conversational, and collaborative.\n\nI think there are a plenty of good points in Rabble\u2019s critique, but there\u2019s\none way that I think he\u2019s extremely wrong. There is still a lot to do in the\nActivityPub ecosystem, but we have the architecture and extension mechanisms\nto make them possible. It\u2019s totally not required to go start a whole new\nsocial protocol to build those things in from scratch. In fact, it\u2019s a real\nmistake; it\u2019s far better to work from the existing standard and build on it.\nOpen standards like ActivityPub have a legitimacy that ad hoc systems like\nNostr can never have, and it\u2019s the reason that there is so much interesting\ndevelopment going on in the ActivityPub world.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Mastodon\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Messages Over ActivityPubMay 19, 2023In \"activitypub\"\n\nAnother chapter done!February 8, 2024In \"activitypub\"\n\nEarly Access to O\u2019Reilly Media ActivityPub BookMarch 7, 2024Liked by 1 person\n\n  * Tagged\n  * activitypub\n\n## Published by Evan Prodromou\n\nDirector of Open Technology at Open Earth Foundation (OEF).

Ga\u00ebtan Perrault says:\n\nApril 14, 2024 at 5:54 pm\n\n@evanprodromou It\u2019s great that you responded to this with some clarity. But I\nthink there\u2019s an underlying misunderstanding here. A lot of these complaints\ncenter on \u201cthis is my content, I should be able to do whatever I want with\nit\u201d. But there\u2019s a publisher here too. The instance and their admin team.\nYou\u2019re addressing some of the technical details, but the general theme of the\ncomplaints is simply a dislike of the publisher model... Possibly the\nexistence of a publisher at all... /1\n\nReply\n\n    1. Ga\u00ebtan Perrault says:\n\nApril 14, 2024 at 6:03 pm\n\n@evanprodromou I can understand and empathize with wanting a different version\nof these things. But at some level, it\u2019s starting to look like OP is asking\nfor a different thing all together. ActivityPub is very much a \u201cpoint in time\u201d\npublishing platform. And it has to have some basic agreements in terms of\npublishing standards. If you don\u2019t want another publisher to be in control,\nthen you have to be your own publisher. And Mastodon enables that today for\nrelatively cheap. //\n\nReply\n\n  4. Mark Nottingham says:\n\nApril 14, 2024 at 6:34 pm\n\n@evanprodromou one starting assumption that I had was that because mastodon\nused webfinger for identity, it subsumed it to the webfinger resource,\ncreating an opportunity it\u2019s to separate these concerns and, for example,\npoint a webfinger on my domain to an activitypub server run by someone else.\nThat this doesn\u2019t really work is disappointing; it\u2019s very \u201cbig software\u201d not\ninternet \u201csmall piece loosely joined.\u201d\n\nReply\n\n    1. Evan Prodromou says:\n\nApril 14, 2024 at 9:38 pm\n\nThat should work, AFAIK, but there\u2019s not an easy way to point it back to your\nWebfinger. So if user1@domain1 links to an url like\nhttps://domain2/users/12345 with preferredUsername user2, most remote servers\nwill build a Webfinger address like user2@domain2. We\u2019ve got some work to do\nin reverse discovery; you should take a look at the ActivityPub Webfinger\nreport. https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-webfinger/\n\nReply\n\n  5. Alan Langford says:\n\nApril 14, 2024 at 6:54 pm\n\n@evanprodromou 1. I've found the culture of server admins is vindictive only\nif you're a persistent pain in the ass. Almost every case of admin\nvindictiveness I've seen has been justified, and even then the responses have\nbeen measured.2. If you don't trust your server admin with sensitive\ninformation, start your own server(*). I know a good number of people who have\ndone this. If anything, the issue is making it easier for people with limited\ntechnical skills to set up an instance. /2\n\nReply\n\n    1. Alan Langford says:\n\nApril 14, 2024 at 6:54 pm\n\n@evanprodromou * \u2013 If you're not running it on your own hardware off your own\nnet connection, you're still trusting your data centre, so the point is\nessentially moot.\n\nReply\n\n  6. Tassoman says:\n\nApril 14, 2024 at 7:27 pm\n\nI agree #fediverse has a lot more to express, but unfortunately the most\nfamous software is also the less elastic. For example \"usernames\nfossilization\" (point nr.3) is just a limit of one software, the most\npropagated. That software lacks of support for others while the others are\ntrying to acknowledge it to avoid missing a 70% of people to talk to.\nFediverse isn't just a matter of \"let's drain people from X SNS or Y\". It's a\nmatter of dialogue between developers, decentralization is strong but cohesion\nis poor. That's probably why someone else have built other protocols more than\n#ActivityPub\n\nReply\n\n  7. Panos Damelos (Catodon) :catodon: says:\n\nApril 14, 2024 at 8:20 pm\n\n@evanprodromou one thing that\u2019s bugging me is that you can\u2019t see all replies\nto a post from a remote server. Of course you can visit the original server,\nbut having to do that everytime is pretty bad UX \u2013 not to mention that each\nserver has a different UI which makes the experience even more confusing. When\nI open a post, I expect to be able to see the discussion under it, without\nleaving my platform/app. I think it\u2019s one of the things that make fedi weird\nand confusing for a lot of people. I discussed this with two project lead devs\nlately and they both agree there\u2019s no efficient way to do it, not all\nplatforms use the same API, and even if you cover the most common APIs to\nfetch replies from a remote server, they feel that the extra load this would\ncause on the remote server is bad practice and would cause complaints. So we\nhave to send users to the remote servers if they want to see all comments to a\nremote post \u2013 and if they want to reply to something, they might need to copy\nthe URL to fetch it on their home server and reply from there. This is not how\nusers expect public discourse to happen, and it seems unnecessarily\ncomplicated in practice. Wish there was a solution to that.\n\nReply\n\n    1. Panos Damelos (Catodon) :catodon: says:\n\nApril 14, 2024 at 8:29 pm\n\n@evanprodromou to give a specific example why this can be not only annoying on\na personal level but problematic for the fediverse as a whole, imagine when\nThreads (with its comparatively huge userbase) fully federates. People will\nsee a post with x replies on their server, and then when they visit the post\non threads.net it may have 10 times more replies. How many times will someone\ndo that? Eventually some people will just choose to move to Threads and save\nthemselves from the extra clicks and time wasted from this.\n\nReply\n\n    2. Evan Prodromou says:\n\nApril 14, 2024 at 8:35 pm\n\nEvery note, article, image, video or audio on the fediverse has a \u2018replies\u2019\nproperty which is a collection of all the replies that have been made anywhere\non the fediverse. It\u2019s a major bummer that these aren\u2019t shown in a lot of UIs.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n  * Comment\n  * Reblog\n  * Subscribe Subscribed\n\n    * Evan Prodromou's Blog\n    * Already have a WordPress.com account?
