His first open-source project, react-\nboilerplate/react-boilerplate, gained a whopping 10k stars in just one weekend\nafter appearing on the homepage of Hacker News. This success led Max to drop\nout of university and create several other popular open-source projects,\nincluding styled-components. This library accelerates the process of building\nstyles in React components.\n\nNowadays, the number of projects hitting 10k stars is more common, inflating\nthe overall number of GitHub Stars. Presently, GitHub has over 100 million\nusers, but back when React Boilerplate started, GitHub had fewer than 10\nmillion users. Getting 10k stars on a project seemed impossible, but with 10x\nthe amount of users, the value of the GitHub Star has suffered from inflation.\n\nLooking back in 2023, the biggest projects with the highest star growth can\nattribute these star events to intentional marketing. Landing on the front\npage of Hacker News is still challenging, but tweeting your project's social\ncard can return similar results. The industry has changed a lot in the last 10\nyears, and where there was a time when open source was driven by weekend code\nsessions, today open source is fueled by sustainable sponsorship and venture\ncapital. This is not entirely a bad thing, as it provides a sustainable future\nfor the biggest projects we get to use and love.\n\nThe challenge in this new reality is defining what is worth looking at and\nwhether GitHub Stars are still relevant for discovering projects worth your\ntime. Correlating the best metric to identify projects to invest your time in\ndepends on who has the biggest reach in a community. This seems contrary to\nhow open source started and marks a shift in how we think about success in\nopen source moving forward. These high growth moments are now indicators of\nbig events like appearing on a subreddit or getting mentioned by a developer\ninfluencer on YouTube.\n\nA popular site to see your star growth is star-history and it has become a\nstandard for sharing your GitHub Star growth hacking journey. They also link a\npost on \"how to get more github stars.\"\n\nSome notable projects with Star events in the last year include godot,\ndaytona, plane, and zed.\n\n### Growth Hacking With GitHub Stars\n\ngodot/gotengine capitalized on the Unity announcement on September 12th, of\n2023, with their own announcements. At that time, they had been working on\ntheir tool for some time and already had a community they tapped into to share\ntheir open source alternative game engine.\n\n(note this chart is available on oss.fyi/godot)\n\nzed-industries/zed, the successor to the atom editor built in rust,\ncoordinated the launch for their repo with friends and trusted acquaintances\nto create a star event that registers as the edge of the graph. That, indeed,\nis a vertical line if I ever saw one.\n\ndaytonaio/daytona, a self hosted cloud developer environment, learn from its\npredecessors to become the most starred project for a few days.\n\nFinally, makeplane/plane came into some heat when they posted their chart with\nunnamed competitors. The stars are valid, and the result of conscientious\ngrowth hacking.\n\nThe open source community does not like to be sold and asking for a star is a\nlow effort way for makers to grow and engage a community through open source.\nWith that said, there are still a lot of open source maintainers and\ncontributors who prefer not to participate in the process of growth hacking to\ngain GitHub Stars, and a lot of pushback came from engineers who built their\ncareers on growing open source differently.\n\nThe Plane team wrote up outlining their growth hacking journey in a follow up\npost to the original tweet.\n\n(Read about their journey to 20k stars here.)\n\n### The Problem with Open Source Star Inflation\n\nNow that we have established that stars are the metric for growth hacking,\nwhat is the metric for showing the project's health? In our opinion at\nOpenSauced, there is not one metric but a few and you can start aligning\nalongside stars.\n\nThere is no doubt that thanks to growth hacking we are seeing GitHub Star\nhyper-inflation. Now, with currency inflation, it is encouraged to find\nalternative places to store your assets. Still, with GitHub being the home for\nopen source, I don\u2019t imagine a new stargazing like currency showing up anytime\nsoon.\n\nStars are not quite a representation of adoption, but if we look closer, we\ncould correlate a combination of metrics to tell a bigger story:\n\n  1. Commit velocity is a quick way to see a project\u2019s activity.\n  2. Stars are a quick way to see early interest, but there is no correlation.\n\n_Above is a star and commit velocity charts in grafana for the makeplane/plane\nproject. _ There is a shift happening in open source, and I think it would be\nunfair to not recognize the folks that built projects that made this\necosystem, the same ecosystem that makes it so easy to become an overnight\n(over a few months) success.\n\nIn a conversation with Brendan Burns on that same podcast, I learned that\nearly Kubernetes used issue counts to measure interest and pull requests to\nassess adoption. Taking it a step further, you can see a correlation from\nforks to stars.\n\nThe chart above is the correlation between stars and forks.\n\nBased on my conversation with Brendan this correlates to adoption and when you\nreally dig in you will find that with plane being so new, their contributions\nmade exclusively form plane from employees, with the exception of one\ncontribution from a developer member of the French Government. Perhaps a sign\nof adoption starting with them.\n\nThe logical next step is to examine contributions from organizations and\ndetermine if there's a solid star-to-PR pipeline. If you're keen on monitoring\nyour star-to-PR pipeline, consider setting up a workspace on OpenSauced to\nbegin uncovering valuable engagement insights.\n\n(oss.fyi/growthhack)\n\nAs the open source landscape evolves and GitHub Stars continue to inflate,\nit's essential for developers and contributors to consider multiple metrics\nwhen evaluating the health and success of a project.\n\nBy looking at commit velocity, issue counts, pull requests, and forks\nalongside stars, we can better understand a project's adoption and overall\nvalue. Let's continue to support the open-source community by focusing on\nmeaningful contributions and nurturing authentic engagement, ensuring that we\nmaintain the integrity that makes open source so special.\n\nIf you have some metrics you feel are a better focus on measuring open source\nsuccess, consider leaving us some feedback.\n\nRecent Posts\n\nNavigating the Challenges of Scaling Open Source Projects\n\nBekahHW\n\n7 mins read\n\nGain insights into the challenges of scaling open source projects, with\nsolutions for comprehensive understanding, collaboration, and sustainable\nproj...\n\nRead More\n\nAI Secret Sauce: Traction In Open Source\n\nbdougie\n\n5 mins read\n\nTaking a look at the most successful open source projects in the AI space to\ndiscover what their secret sauce is for growth.\n\nRead More\n\n## Subscribe for Extra Sauce\n\nStay up to date with the latest OpenSauced news and trends.\n\nSOCIALS\n\nMENU\n\nAbout\n\nBlog\n\nChangelog\n\nMore Sauce\n\nhot.opensauced.pizza\n\ninsights.opensauced.pizza\n\ndocs.opensauced.pizza\n\nnews.opensauced.pizza\n\nContact Us\n\nhello@opensauced.pizza\n\n\u00a9 2024 Open Sauced, INC.
