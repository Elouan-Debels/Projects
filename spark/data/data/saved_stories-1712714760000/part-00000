(v2.0)\n\nOrganisations working in disparate domains are independently discovering\npatterns for building software that look the same. These systems are more\nrobust, more resilient, more flexible and better positioned to meet modern\ndemands.\n\nThese changes are happening because application requirements have changed\ndramatically in recent years. Only a few years ago a large application had\ntens of servers, seconds of response time, hours of offline maintenance and\ngigabytes of data. Today applications are deployed on everything from mobile\ndevices to cloud-based clusters running thousands of multi-core processors.\nUsers expect millisecond response times and 100% uptime. Data is measured in\nPetabytes. Today's demands are simply not met by yesterday\u2019s software\narchitectures.\n\nWe believe that a coherent approach to systems architecture is needed, and we\nbelieve that all necessary aspects are already recognised individually: we\nwant systems that are Responsive, Resilient, Elastic and Message Driven. We\ncall these Reactive Systems.\n\nSystems built as Reactive Systems are more flexible, loosely-coupled and\nscalable. This makes them easier to develop and amenable to change. They are\nsignificantly more tolerant of failure and when failure does occur they meet\nit with elegance rather than disaster. Reactive Systems are highly responsive,\ngiving users effective interactive feedback.\n\n### Reactive Systems are:\n\nResponsive: The system responds in a timely manner if at all possible.\nResponsiveness is the cornerstone of usability and utility, but more than\nthat, responsiveness means that problems may be detected quickly and dealt\nwith effectively. Responsive systems focus on providing rapid and consistent\nresponse times, establishing reliable upper bounds so they deliver a\nconsistent quality of service. This consistent behaviour in turn simplifies\nerror handling, builds end user confidence, and encourages further\ninteraction.\n\nResilient: The system stays responsive in the face of failure. This applies\nnot only to highly-available, mission-critical systems \u2014 any system that is\nnot resilient will be unresponsive after a failure. Resilience is achieved by\nreplication, containment, isolation and delegation. Failures are contained\nwithin each component, isolating components from each other and thereby\nensuring that parts of the system can fail and recover without compromising\nthe system as a whole. Recovery of each component is delegated to another\n(external) component and high-availability is ensured by replication where\nnecessary. The client of a component is not burdened with handling its\nfailures.\n\nElastic: The system stays responsive under varying workload. Reactive Systems\ncan react to changes in the input rate by increasing or decreasing the\nresources allocated to service these inputs. This implies designs that have no\ncontention points or central bottlenecks, resulting in the ability to shard or\nreplicate components and distribute inputs among them. Reactive Systems\nsupport predictive, as well as Reactive, scaling algorithms by providing\nrelevant live performance measures. They achieve elasticity in a cost-\neffective way on commodity hardware and software platforms.\n\nMessage Driven: Reactive Systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to\nestablish a boundary between components that ensures loose coupling, isolation\nand location transparency. This boundary also provides the means to delegate\nfailures as messages. Employing explicit message-passing enables load\nmanagement, elasticity, and flow control by shaping and monitoring the message\nqueues in the system and applying back-pressure when necessary. Location\ntransparent messaging as a means of communication makes it possible for the\nmanagement of failure to work with the same constructs and semantics across a\ncluster or within a single host. Non-blocking communication allows recipients\nto only consume resources while active, leading to less system overhead.\n\nLarge systems are composed of smaller ones and therefore depend on the\nReactive properties of their constituents. This means that Reactive Systems\napply design principles so these properties apply at all levels of scale,\nmaking them composable. The largest systems in the world rely upon\narchitectures based on these properties and serve the needs of billions of\npeople daily. It is time to apply these design principles consciously from the\nstart instead of rediscovering them each time.\n\n33008 people already signed (Full list)\n\n  * Ehsan Souri\n  * Rafael Lefever\n  * Anthony Bonnemaire\n  * Hilton Junior - DPO Saud\u00e1vel\n  * Manuel Alves\n  * Jonathan Victorica\n  * Jonathan Neufeld\n  * Claudio D'Artibale\n  * Luis Josu\u00e9 Olivera Ponce\n  * Luis Reyes Segundo\n  * Alexandre Izefler\n  * Brandon Barroso\n  * Jhon Oscar Salazar Orozco\n  * Prempeh Gyan\n  * Nishanth Suraj\n  * Xinhua Gu\n  * S\u00e1ndor Lend\u00e9r\n  * Mohammad Asaad Akram\n  * Lucas Soares\n  * PARAMESH RAJAGOPALAN\n  * \uc601\uaddc \ud55c\n  * Elisa Rotger\n  * Denis \u010cahuk\n  * Nadiri Abdeljalil\n  * Donald Anthony Chiay\u00e9\n  * Iurco Mihail\n  * Nick Themelis\n  * Davide Restivo\n  * Saniya Zahid\n  * Sourav Kundu\n\nTweet\n\nGlossary\n\nDownload as PDF\n\nSuggest improvements\n\nRead the Reactive Principles\n\nAuthors (in alphabetic order, with roughly equal contributions): Jonas Bon\u00e9r,\nDave Farley, Roland Kuhn, and Martin Thompson.
