Chris Polk, the Navy's program manager for undersea weapons, detailed\nthe effort to The War Zone and other attendees at the Navy League's Sea Air\nSpace symposium near Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. The goal, Polk said, was\nto have a torpedo that costs $500,000 or less, with all components acquired\nand produced within a year. For comparison, the current unit cost of a Mk 48\nMod 7 torpedo is approximately $4.2 million, according to the Navy's 2025\nFiscal Year budget request.\n\n\"You think I'm crazy, but this can happen, especially when you're not making\nan ADCAP [Advanced Capability torpedo],\" Polk said, referring to the Navy's\nrecent Mk 48 heavyweight torpedo variants. \"This is a mission-specific,\nlimited-capability weapon, but it's still the same explosive yield.\"\n\nTechnicians perform maintenance on a Mark 48 Advanced Capabilities torpedo at\nKeyport, Washington in 1982.

This includes the war in Ukraine,\nwhere large quantities are Western weapons are being consumed, as well as the\nMiddle East, where Iranian-backed Houthi rebels of Yemen are destabilizing\nmaritime activities around the Red Sea and sucking up large sums of advanced\nand expensive American weapons, which are challenging to restock, in the\nprocess.\n\n\"I think recent experience in Ukraine and the Red Sea emphasize the [Defense\nDepartment's] critical demand for all types of munitions in order to enforce\nthe policies of our elected leaders and to ensure that our Navy can operate\nworldwide undeterred,\" Polk said.\n\nPHILIPPINE SEA (Jan. 26, 2023) \u2013 Chief Torpedoman\u2019s Mate Christopher Collado\n(right), and Sonar Technician Submarines 3rd Class Steven Flores (left),\nassigned to the Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine USS Annapolis (SSN\n760), conduct torpedo offloading procedures in the torpedo room while\nunderway, Jan. 26.

The next-generation Type 096\nnuclear ballistic missile submarine, set to enter service for the People's\nLiberation Army Navy (PLAN) before 2030, was described by analyst Christopher\nCarlson in October as a future \"nightmare\" for the U.S. and NATO due to its\nstealthy characteristics.\n\nSupply chain issues also threaten the production of conventional heavyweight\ntorpedoes. The production line for the Mk 48 Mod 7 was halted in 1996 and\nrestarted beginning in Fiscal Year 2016. As Defense News previously reported,\nredesigning the torpedo to troubleshoot part obsolescence after a two-decade\nproduction hiatus took about three years. A ramp-up in production driven by\ncombat requirements in a future war could, Navy leaders have acknowledged,\ncreate parts bottlenecks, leading to shortages for both the Mod 7 and the\nfuture Mod 8.\n\nIllustration of a Mk 48 Mod 7 being launched. Lockheed Martin\n\nRAPTOR, as Polk describes it, might pinch-hit in the case of a parts squeeze.\n\n\"What RAPTOR is, talking about supply chain challenges,\" Polk said, \"is, what\ncan I make that looks like a heavyweight torpedo, but with procurable parts.\"\n\nRear Adm. Todd Weeks, program executive officer for strategic submarines, said\nthe prospect of a future hot war in the Pacific also demands unconventional\nsolutions.\n\n\"If we go to war today, it's with the Navy we have,\" he said. \"So thinking out\nof the box, thinking about the problem differently, is really what this is all\nabout. It's as much a thought exercise today as it is anything else. But we'll\nsee where it goes.\"\n\nA key to the vision for RAPTOR, Polk said, is removing many of the high-end\nrequirements that make the current ADCAP torpedoes the highly evolved multi-\nmission weapons that do \"everything to the 10th degree.\" If the Navy can\ncompromise on elite speed, depth, and mission requirements for these specific\nmunitions, Polk suggests it could in exchange achieve a numerical advantage\nwith a stockpile of weapons more limited in mission and scope.\n\nSailors and Military Sealift Command civilian mariners working from Polaris\nPoint transfer torpedoes to the Los Angeles class fast-attack submarine USS\nTopeka from the pier, Guam, May 31, 2018.

Weeks called RAPTOR the product of \"a lot of smart people sitting\naround trying to rethink the problem.\" He and Polk characterized the\ndevelopment effort as consisting to date of tabletop exercises and PowerPoint\npresentations and emphasized that no program of record yet existed for RAPTOR.\n\nPolk hinted that a limited-mission cheap torpedo might have applications to\nother platforms apart from Navy submarines, but declined to expand on the\nother uses being considered.\n\n\"There's other platforms that could launch a heavyweight torpedo, if\nnecessary,\" he said. \"Some things are in development right now. I guess we're\ntrying not to limit ourselves to just submarine launch applications.\"\n\nShips, helicopters, and maritime patrol aircraft all launch torpedoes in\ntoday\u2019s U.S. Navy.

Zingaro/Released)\n\nThe concept of cheap, fast-buy versions of more exquisite equipment has\nrecently held great appeal for the U.S. military. The Air Force even coined\nthe adjective \"attritable\" to describe a category of unmanned air platforms\nand other weapons that are cheap enough to be lost in combat without major\nconsequence. For years, the service tested low-cost, fuel-efficient air-\nlaunched cruise missiles under a program known as Gray Wolf in anticipation of\na future conflict in which mass missile launches might be required. There has\nbeen continued interest in this kind of capability since then. Just in\nJanuary, the Air Force Research Laboratory announced a challenge for the\ndevelopment of a missile that costs less than $150,000 per unit and has a\nrange of 500 nautical miles.\n\nHowever, the Defense Department has struggled to limit the expense and\nrequirements for ostensibly low-cost and limited-utility systems, making the\nintent behind concepts like RAPTOR difficult to realize. Current conflicts\nalso underscore the weak point that the U.S. fondness for exquisite weapons\nrepresents: the aforementioned need for munitions to support Ukraine, for\nexample, have put a spotlight on lengthy production lead times. During a war\nin the Pacific, the number of naval targets would be larger than anything seen\nsince the Cold War. The ability to quickly replenish torpedo stocks,\nespecially for use against less capable targets, could be a major factor in\nsucceeding in such a conflict.\n\nPolk does have a target for a physical experiment: he wants to have a\nprototype or demonstrator in the water by the end of the year. To do that, he\nadded, he and collaborators are considering a range of research and\ndevelopment partners, including DARPA, the Office of Naval Research, and\ncommercial companies, \"to take this concept from paper to be in the water.\"\n\nFor now, the full-capacity Mk 48 Mod 8 torpedoes are set to start rolling off\nproduction lines in 2027, according to the briefing.\n\nContact the editor: tyler@twz.com\n\nNaval MunitionsNaviesProcurementTorpedoesU.S. NavySea Air Space 2024\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
