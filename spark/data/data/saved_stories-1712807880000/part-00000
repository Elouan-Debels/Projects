We abused them for layout, then we maligned them for being abused. Now they are free.\n  * With one weird trick, browsers can be made to agree whether borders are inside or outside a bounding box.\n  * Font tags have gone the way of the marquee tags.\n  * Quirks Mode is a historical footnote.\n\nWe can go home now.\n\nHowever, our solutions have bred new problems, and I\u2019m not talking about\nReact. Not here. Not today.\n\nIt has never been easier to make and share a 90s era home page. But, we don\u2019t\nmake 90s era web pages anymore. The social media giants have herded us into\ntheir pens and we rarely contribute to the vast wilderness of free\ninformation. So, the web search giants are starving, unable to infer relevance\nfrom links, forced to show nothing but advertisements above the fold. The\nrising giants of artificial intelligence must make do with everything that has\never been said in public and everything that was given freely to other giants\nin private. Going forward, any intellectual property worth keeping will be\nworth keeping secret.\n\nWe have a surplus of giants all in need of feeding. And so we feed them for\nlack of better options.\n\nThus begins the era of better options. Some of them are already here. Some of\nthem were always here.\n\nFor example, we have Signal which gives us rooms where we can have private,\nearnest, intimate conversations: rooms where we can safely make social\nmistakes; rooms where we can grow and be forgiven. We no longer have to feed a\nsocial media giant if we want to chitchat, all for the low-low price of\nenabling other jerks to chitchat too. We need only trust the developers of the\nchat app and our app store giants to remain benevolent.\n\nWe also have Mastodon and ActivityPub. Just like the first time a Boomer\nphotocopied a page of jokes and a vaguely menacing threat and forwarded it to\na dozen friends and family, we can once again experience the thrill of\nwhispering in a crowded room where every living being can hear. We can wait to\nsee if anyone heard us, liked us, loved us, shared us. Though we no longer\nneed to feed a social media giant, we do still have to worry about what\nhappens to us when the wrong people hear.\n\nWe can still make 90s era web pages. They feed the search giants, but\nsometimes we want to be found or influence what else can be found. If they\nabuse our attention with enough advertisements, we can feed a different search\nengine. Not all of them are giants. Some of them let you pay them so they can\nstay in business without betraying your trust.\n\nWe can still send email and you can choose whether you need to feed a giant to\ndo that. Mailing lists still work.\n\nWe need a better dream. I\u2019ve got one and it can be yours for free\u2020.\n\n\u2020 Free as in Arrakis, home to the most valuable resource in the universe and\nthe perpetual struggle to defend it\u2021.\n\n\u2021 There might (still) be giants. The giants might be worms.\n\nThere is a rapidly deteriorating fiction that a web browser represents the\ninterests of the user.\n\nThe first moves were chosen wisely. Over a backdrop of people emailing each\nother virus.exe and booting their computers off CDs they found in parking\nlots, the web was born into a memory safe language with an event loop. A web\npage couldn\u2019t read your passwords, delete your recipes, or draw a button\noutside of its frame. We called that frame the \u201cchrome\u201d. Now it\u2019s spelled\n\u201cChrome\u201d and because we can\u2019t contemplate alternatives, we feed the giant.\nBut, I digress.\n\nIt took some time for the cracks to show. Web pages have an umbilical cord to\nthe server that hosted them. Web servers can talk to each other and web pages\ncan talk to other web servers. In defense of their own reputation, a web\nserver can choose to limit their web page\u2019s ability to run strange programs,\nbut you can\u2019t choose to prevent a web page from talking to its web server. So,\na vast network of pervasive surveilance is born.\n\nAs this system grew, the paltry defense of your passwords and recipes became\nirrelevant. The important passwords and recipes are no longer on your\ncomputer. They are on other web servers.\n\nThen, every browser became dependent on the money that flows from search.\nMaking a browser that breaks the connection between a web page and a web\nserver is not contemplatable.\n\nWe call web browsers \u201cuser agents\u201d even though you, a user, no longer have\nagency.\n\nMeanwhile, there is also a rapidly deteriorating fiction that a web\napplication represents the interests of any single author.\n\nThe vast majority of software bundled into a web application is dependencies.\nWhere virus.exe ran away with all the authority of the user, a web page\u2019s\ndependencies run away with all the authority of the web page.\n\nWhile we contemplate agency in the next generation of the web, we must also\ncontemplate the agency of the author of an application. If we can credibly\nconfine a web application, can the application also credibly confine its\ndependencies?\n\nI don\u2019t know whether there was ever a credible fiction that app stores\nrepresented the interests of users or services. They offer to defend the\ninterests of users by guarding their own gates, but they also use those gates\nand their own promotional mechanisms to ensure that they collect the lion\u2019s\nshare and suffer no competition.\n\nThey provide no credible isolation at runtime, so one does not simply publish\nan app. One must constantly run the treadmill of recompiling with the latest\npatch releases of all the underlying frameworks in the hope of staying one\nstep ahead of a zero-day exploit that would not have been possible in the\nsecurity model of a web page.\n\nOne does not archive an app. One does not keep an app. One does not send an\napp to a friend. One does not pass an app on to their children.\n\nWe need a better dream.\n\nI dream that the next frontier of the web starts with chat, where all social\nproblems and solutions begin and end. The web needs some of that.\n\nChat is a medium of distribution. We already use chat to distribute links and\nembed media. Currently, those links exit to web pages or apps. We can trust\nneither. We need chat to become a medium for delivering web pages and web\napps. Let\u2019s call these \u201cweblets\u201d.\n\n  * Weblets are confined. They have no implicit ties or dependence to an original host. To connect to a host, they must obtain it with the grace of the user. They must chat. So, chat becomes also a medium for obtaining permission.\n\n  * Weblets can be saved. A weblet is self-confined. They can be archived. They can be sent to a friend. They do not break with age.\n\nWe (old people) remember when Microsoft undermined desktop publishing and\nspreadsheets just by making it possible to link and embed objects across those\nhitherto isolated realms.\n\nWe should do that. We should do that in the open. We should do that with\nfederation. We should do that on a grander scale than has ever been seen\nbefore.\n\nNow we can talk about Endo.\n\n  * Previous: The JISH Stack\n  * Next: Endo\n\n", "frontpage": false}
