Get funded by Y Combinator.  \n---  \n  \nJanuary 2012\n\nA year ago I noticed a pattern in the least successful startups we'd funded:\nthey all seemed hard to talk to. It felt as if there was some kind of wall\nbetween us. I could never quite tell if they understood what I was saying.\n\nThis caught my attention because earlier we'd noticed a pattern among the most\nsuccessful startups, and it seemed to hinge on a different quality. We found\nthe startups that did best were the ones with the sort of founders about whom\nwe'd say \"they can take care of themselves.\" The startups that do best are\nfire-and-forget in the sense that all you have to do is give them a lead, and\nthey'll close it, whatever type of lead it is. When they're raising money, for\nexample, you can do the initial intros knowing that if you wanted to you could\nstop thinking about it at that point. You won't have to babysit the round to\nmake sure it happens. That type of founder is going to come back with the\nmoney; the only question is how much on what terms.\n\nIt seemed odd that the outliers at the two ends of the spectrum could be\ndetected by what appeared to be unrelated tests. You'd expect that if the\nfounders at one end were distinguished by the presence of quality x, at the\nother end they'd be distinguished by lack of x. Was there some kind of inverse\nrelation between resourcefulness and being hard to talk to?\n\nIt turns out there is, and the key to the mystery is the old adage \"a word to\nthe wise is sufficient.\" Because this phrase is not only overused, but\noverused in an indirect way (by prepending the subject to some advice), most\npeople who've heard it don't know what it means. What it means is that if\nsomeone is wise, all you have to do is say one word to them, and they'll\nunderstand immediately. You don't have to explain in detail; they'll chase\ndown all the implications.\n\nIn much the same way that all you have to do is give the right sort of founder\na one line intro to a VC, and he'll chase down the money. That's the\nconnection. Understanding all the implications \u2014 even the inconvenient\nimplications \u2014 of what someone tells you is a subset of resourcefulness. It's\nconversational resourcefulness.\n\nLike real world resourcefulness, conversational resourcefulness often means\ndoing things you don't want to. Chasing down all the implications of what's\nsaid to you can sometimes lead to uncomfortable conclusions. The best word to\ndescribe the failure to do so is probably \"denial,\" though that seems a bit\ntoo narrow. A better way to describe the situation would be to say that the\nunsuccessful founders had the sort of conservatism that comes from weakness.\nThey traversed idea space as gingerly as a very old person traverses the\nphysical world. [1]\n\nThe unsuccessful founders weren't stupid. Intellectually they were as capable\nas the successful founders of following all the implications of what one said\nto them. They just weren't eager to.\n\nSo being hard to talk to was not what was killing the unsuccessful startups.\nIt was a sign of an underlying lack of resourcefulness. That's what was\nkilling them. As well as failing to chase down the implications of what was\nsaid to them, the unsuccessful founders would also fail to chase down funding,\nand users, and sources of new ideas. But the most immediate evidence I had\nthat something was amiss was that I couldn't talk to them.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] A YC partner wrote:\n\nMy feeling with the bad groups is that coming into office hours, they've\nalready decided what they're going to do and everything I say is being put\nthrough an internal process in their heads, which either desperately tries to\nmunge what I've said into something that conforms with their decision or just\noutright dismisses it and creates a rationalization for doing so. They may not\neven be conscious of this process but that's what I think is happening when\nyou say something to bad groups and they have that glazed over look. I don't\nthink it's confusion or lack of understanding per se, it's this internal\nprocess at work.\n\nWith the good groups, you can tell that everything you say is being looked at\nwith fresh eyes and even if it's dismissed, it's because of some logical\nreason e.g. \"we already tried that\" or \"from speaking to our users that isn't\nwhat they'd like,\" etc. Those groups never have that glazed over look.\n\nThanks to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, Aaron Iba, Jessica Livingston, Robert\nMorris, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
