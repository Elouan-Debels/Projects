He went public with his warning last week, and\nBoeing was quick to discount it.\n\n\u201cWe are fully confident in the 787 Dreamliner. These claims about the\nstructural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the\ncomprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and long-term safety\nof the aircraft,\u201d Boeing said in a statement last week. \u201cThe issues raised\nhave been subject to rigorous engineering examination under FAA oversight.\u201d\n\nThe improperly shimmed gaps were first found more than five years ago, and the\nFAA stopped deliveries of the 787 while Boeing came up with a fix. The\nexisting fleet at the time was inspected and repaired, and new aircraft were\npresumably built to spec.\n\nSalehpour says those repairs were not adequate and there is a danger of\nfatigue failure. Boeing said the fix has been thoroughly vetted and \u201cthese\nissues do not present any safety concerns\u201d or durability problems. It said it\nwill be on the lookout for problems, noting it encourages employees to \u201cspeak\nup\u201d about any safety concerns.\n\n\u201cRetaliation is strictly prohibited at Boeing,\u201d the statement said. The FAA\nsays it is investigating the allegations.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article first appeared on AVweb.\n\nRuss Niles\n\nRuss Niles has been a journalist for 40 years, a pilot for 30 years and joined\nAVweb in 2003.
