Wim Lustenhouwer, VU\nUniversity Amsterdam\n\nOn the banks of the Solo River in Java, Indonesia, 19th-century physician\nEugene Dubois uncovered an astounding fossil find: the bones of what appeared\nto be an ancient human, surrounded by animal remains and shells. Excavated in\nthe 1890s, the site gained fame as the home of \u201cJava Man,\u201d better known today\nas Homo erectus.\n\nDated to between a million and 700,000 years old, the bones immediately\nprovoked controversy, because Dubois claimed they showed evidence of a\ntransitional species between apes and humans. It turns out he was right\u2014Homo\nerectus fossils have since been found in Africa and elsewhere in Asia, and it\nis possible the species is a direct ancestor of our own. But it\u2019s the palm-\nsized shells found alongside the Java remains that are raising big questions\ntoday. An examination of the shells published in Nature suggests that Homo\nerectus may have used the shells for tools and decorated some of them with\ngeometric engravings. At around half a million years old, the shells represent\nthe earliest evidence of such decorative marks and also the first known use of\nshells to make tools.\n\nDubois collected 11 species of freshwater shells at the site, called Trinil.\nMost of them belong to the sub-species Pseudodon vondembuschianus trinilensis,\na now extinct freshwater mussel he described in 1908. Initially scientists\nthought the mollusks had naturally clustered at the site, perhaps driven by\nwater currents. Even without a connection to the human fossil, the cache\nprovided a nice census of ancient freshwater shell life, coming from at least\n166 Pseudodon individuals.\n\nThat\u2019s what first attracted Josephine Joordens, a marine biologist and\narchaeologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands. A few years ago,\nStephen Munro, an archaeologist at Australian National University and a study\nco-author, happened to briefly look through the Dubois shell collection and\ntook a few photos. The images showed markings on the shells, at first\ninvisible to the naked eye. \u201cIt\u2019s strange to see a zigzag pattern on such old\nfossil shells,\u201d recalls Joordens.\n\nViewed up close, one fossil Pseudodon shell from Java shows evidence of\nengraving. Wim Lustenhouwer, VU University Amsterdam\n\nIntrigued, the researchers compared the Dubois shells to how living mollusks\nwere arranged and buried in the wild. The patterns didn\u2019t match up. Most of\nthe shells also had weird holes corresponding to the where the organism\u2019s\nadductor muscle and ligament, used to open and close the shell, would have\nbeen attached. Presumably, someone or something was trying to pry open the\nshell and remove the gooey mussel. Back then, shellfish eaters such as otters,\nrats and monkeys also lived on Java. Figuring out what could have poked holes\nin the shells required some experimentation.\n\nWith no modern specimen to draw from, the team selected a living mollusk with\nthe closest characteristics to the ancient Pseudodons, a freshwater mussel\ncalled Potamida littoralis. The group tried to open the shells with the most\nlikely pointy object at hand on Java, a shark tooth. Only piercing the muscle\npopped the shells open without breaking them. That requires a certain degree\nof dexterity and knowhow, so Homo erectus became the most likely culprit.\n\nSee the hole on the inside of this fossil Pseudodon shell? Homo erectus likely\nbored into the shell at exactly at the spot where the adductor muscle attaches\nto pop it open. Henk Caspers, Naturalis, Leiden, The Netherlands\n\n\u201cThe opening of shellfish by piercing the valve is unusual, and is not seen in\neither [early] Homo sapiens or Neanderthal middens,\u201d which are essentially\nshellfish trash dumps, says Kat Szabo, an archaeologist at the University of\nWollongong. If humans on Java were opening the shells for food, the method\nsuggests they ate the shellfish raw. \u201cAs bivalves open easily after cooking,\nthis does suggest that the mollusks at Trinil weren't cooked,\u201d says Szabo.\n\nThere is another possible reason Homo erectus might have been scraping out\nmollusk shells. One specimen had been modified and was likely used as a tool.\nUnder a microscope, the shell was visibly sharpened, with hallmark striations\nfrom contact with hard material. \u201cThe shell tool has a knife-like edge, so we\nassume that it was used for cutting and/or scraping,\u201d says Joordens.\n\nA shell tool (a) made by modifying the edge of a Pseudodon shell. Zooming in\non the edge (b) reveals how sharp the tool might have been. Francesco\nd\u2019Errico, Bordeaux University\n\nExactly what the shell was used for is impossible to know. A previous study\nsuggested that cut marks on ancient cow bones found on Java likely came from\nshell tools, which could have been used to butcher animals, cut plants or\nclean fish. Neanderthals, which lived about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago, also\nused shells as tools, though there\u2019s evidence that they broke the shells and\nthen sharpened them, notes Enza Spinapolice, an archaeologist at the Max\nPlanck Institute in Germany.\n\nThe presence of a shell tool might explain the dearth of stone tools at\nhominin sites across Indonesia. \u201cThis has always been a puzzle,\u201d says\nJoordens. \u201cHow would they butcher animals without stone tools?\u201d It makes sense\nthat the Java humans would simply use what they had at their disposal, but\nwithout further evidence of shell tools, it\u2019s hard to be 100 percent sure.\n\nThese carvings go deep into the calcium carbonate shell, which is why evidence\nof the pattern survived over the centuries. But it\u2019s possible other shells\nbore more superficial engravings. When fresh, the white shell would have been\ncovered by a leathery brown outer layer, and a carved pattern on such a dark\ncanvas probably looked striking in its day.\n\nPerhaps even more intriguing is a single shell with what appears to be a\ngeometric pattern\u2014zigzagged grooves carved into the center of the outer shell.\nAnalysis points to the patterns being carved on purpose. Again the team turned\nto modern mussels; they tried carving similar patterns into Potamida\nlittoralis with a shark tooth and compared that to weathering and natural\nabrasions. Sure enough, their carvings were the closest matches to the ancient\npattern.\n\nA microscope image of a line engraved by Homo erectus into a Pseudodon shell.\nJoordens et al.\n\n\u201cThat must have been an appealing thing for Homo erectus,\u201d says Joordens. \u201cYou\ncan imagine sitting there with a shell in one hand and a tool in the other\nhand and maybe ready to open the shell for food, but then making a scratch and\nseeing this white line appear.\u201d\n\nThe researchers used two dating techniques on preserved sediment in the shells\nto estimate their age: between 540,000 and 430,000 years old. The team also\nused x-rays to examine the Homo erectus bones and confirm that they came from\nthe same rock layer as the shells. The results suggest that the Homo erectus\nfossils on Java aren\u2019t quite as old as we thought they were. Still, the\ngeometric engraving predates other examples by around 300,000 years, and the\noldest Neanderthal shell tools are also much younger (about 110,000 years\nold).\n\nCreation of geometric patterns could represent a higher level of creativity in\nHomo erectus than previously thought, or maybe such patterns aren\u2019t the\nartistic masterpieces we suppose them to be. \u201cThis forces us to reassess not\nonly the capacities of Homo erectus, but the criteria we use to gauge the\nbehavioral evolution of our own species,\u201d says Szabo.\n\nGiven that other Homo erectus populations used stone technology around the\nsame time, the tools and scratches aren\u2019t totally inconsistent with hominin\nabilities, notes Rick Potts, a paleoanthropologist with the Smithsonian\u2019s\nHuman Origins Program. Homo erectus continued to live on Java until around\n200,000 yeas ago, and for Potts, the possibility that these practices\npersisted as part of Homo erectus culture is even more interesting. \u201cThat\n[would mean] that this incipient capacity to impose a creative pattern on an\nobject was a characteristic of the later members of this species,\u201d says Potts\n\u201cThat's really cool.\u201d\n\nGet the latest Science stories in your inbox.\n\nHelen Thompson | | READ MORE\n\nHelen Thompson writes about science and culture for Smithsonian.
