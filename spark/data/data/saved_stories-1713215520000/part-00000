In\nthe spirit of experimentation and exploration, we want to share what we've\nbeen up to and are excited to get this into your hands as a Developer Preview.\n\nAI, and specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), have been evolving rapidly\nin recent years. We've seen a rise in discussions surrounding autonomous\nagents, systems that can answer complex questions through reasoning, pose\nrelevant follow-up questions, and perform tasks without the need for rigid\ndecision trees or intent-based training.\n\nHowever, building progressively more complex systems on a path to fully\nautonomous agents can be complex \u2013 and even overwhelming. From dealing with\nhandling memory to provide the AI conversation context, to over-designing and\nimplementing complex Retrieval-Augment Generation (RAG) pipelines to provide\nadditional domain knowledge to your system, to figuring out how to stitch\neverything together with your different systems and channels, to measuring LLM\nhallucinations and prompt injection detection, you quickly find yourself down\na rabbit hole. We know because that's where we found ourselves.\n\nToday, as a project within the Twilio Alpha program, we are excited to\nannounce our Developer Preview for Twilio AI Assistants: a platform to build\ncustomer-aware autonomous agents that we call \"Assistants\".\n\n## What is Twilio AI Assistants?\n\nTwilio AI Assistants is an opinionated framework to build and host Assistants\nfor customer-facing use cases.\n\nAt the core of Twilio AI Assistants resides a distinctive customer-aware\napproach facilitated by Customer Memory. This feature will not only\nautomatically handle the conversation history between the user and the\nAssistant, but behind the scenes, use the AI Perception Engine and AI\nPersonalization Engine to create a customer profile that you can augment and\nreference using Segment.\n\nBeyond its customer-centric capabilities, AI Assistants can leverage Tools\nthat you define to make API requests to interact with other systems and access\nKnowledge sources to tap domain expertise without you having to manage your\nown RAG pipeline. If an Assistant can't answer a question or you don't want it\nto handle certain topics, AI Assistants can automatically hand over the\nconversation to a human agent in the Twilio Flex contact center.\n\nMoreover, the Assistants are equipped with out-of-the-box Guardrails - a set\nof prompt injection detection rules, content moderation, and hallucination\nmeasurements (coming soon) that act as a safeguard, ensuring the trust and\nobservability of each interaction.\n\nAI Assistants are built on top of various state-of-the-art Large Language\nModels, including models from OpenAI, amongst others. We at Twilio are\nconstantly exploring how we can use the latest advancements in AI so you can\nfocus on building great customer experiences rather than subscribing to AI\nnewsletters and keeping up with the blistering pace of AI advancements.\n\nOverview of AI Assistants functionality and interactions\n\n## Twilio AI Assistants Use Cases\n\nDuring conversations with customers, three primary use cases stood out for AI\nAssistants:\n\n1) Support Automation: AI Assistants offer a robust solution for automating\nservice requests, alleviating the burden on customer support teams. Through\nseamless integration with platforms like Flex, customers can initially engage\nwith AI Assistants and smoothly transition to human agents if necessary.\n\n2) Pre-sales, Lead Qualification, and Growth Marketing: Leveraging the\nconversational capabilities of AI Assistants, businesses can streamline pre-\nsales interactions, lead qualification processes, and growth marketing\nstrategies. Imagine a scenario where AI Assistants replace traditional form\nfills with dynamic conversational experiences, enabling the intelligent\ngathering and analysis of customer data.\n\n3) Self-Service Product Assistance: AI Assistants can prove invaluable in\nguiding customers through product adoption phases, enhancing user experience,\nand driving conversion rates. Utilizing the Customer Memory of an Assistant\nenables personalized onboarding experiences for each user's journey. Gathering\ncrucial data during onboarding can then be utilized for customized marketing\nstrategies in the future.\n\nWhile these use cases were notable in our initial discussions, we're confident\nthat you'll uncover even more. AI Assistants is designed for versatility, and\nwe're excited to witness the innovations you'll create!\n\n## Building an Assistant\n\nInitially, you can configure your Assistant through our configuration UI.\nThere, you can give your Assistant a personality, turn on Customer Memory, and\nconfigure its capabilities through Tools and Knowledge. We plan to add the\nability to deploy via CLI or API later in our Developer Preview so you can\nmanage your Assistant from your own workflows.\n\n### Customer Memory\n\nTwilio AI Assistants is built on top of what we call Customer Memory.\n\nAI Assistants will automatically keep track of conversation history and\nattempt to learn about a customer as they converse with them. Powered by the\nAI Perception Engine and AI Personalization Engine Assistants can reference\nany data you have in a Segment Profile, but also build a customer profile even\nif you are not using Segment yet.\n\nAnd since Customer Memory is built on top of Segment, you'll be able to use\nthe data outside of AI Assistants. Whether you use it in your next marketing\ncampaign, help your contact center agents more effectively answer questions\nusing Unified Profiles, or pipe AI Assistants' data into your own data\nwarehouse, every conversation with AI Assistants helps you better understand\nyour users.\n\n### Tools\n\nWith Tools, your Assistant can reach out to other systems to retrieve\nadditional data or perform actions. AI Assistants does this by making HTTP\nrequests to the API endpoints you provide. All you have to do is give AI\nAssistants a URL, the format of the data you expect AI Assistants to send, and\na description of when you want AI Assistants to use the Tool, and your AI\nAssistant will determine when to use the Tool on its own.\n\n### Knowledge\n\nManaging domain knowledge for LLMs using RAG pipelines is important to reduce\nthe risk of hallucinations, control what data the AI has access to, and be\nconfident your data is always up-to-date.\n\nBuilding a RAG pipeline is hard, though! From loading the data to picking the\nright embedding and chunking strategies to actually wiring up your pipeline,\neach step requires careful decision making.\n\nAI Assistants come with a RAG system out of the box. All you need to do is\ngive us the websites and files you want to process and a description of when\nyou want AI Assistants to use them, and we will take care of the rest.\n\n### Security\n\nAI Assistants comes with a set of default safety features such as:\n\n  * Prompt injection protection: to reduce the risk of malicious messages manipulating the behavior of your assistant\n  * Content moderation: to reduce the risk of inappropriate content sent to or generated by your Assistant\n  * Observability: to monitor the performance, behavior, and health of your Assistant with guardrail metrics\n  * Type-safe Tool input validation: to avoid AI Assistants sending invalid data to your APIs\n  * Webhook signatures for API requests: to make sure you can validate requests coming from AI Assistants and control what actions can be taken\n\nWe plan to continue our exploration of the most critical safety mechanisms and\nguardrails in the coming months.\n\n## Connecting your Assistant\n\nWithin our AI Assistants console, you can use the simulator to test your\nAssistant as you build. Once you are ready to introduce your Assistant to the\nworld, it\u2019s compatible with a wide range of channels \u2013 SMS, WhatsApp, web\nchat, mobile \u2013 with more to come.\n\n### SMS / WhatsApp\n\nAI Assistants is compatible with Twilio Programmable Messaging both for SMS\nand WhatsApp. Check out our documentation to learn more about how to integrate\nyour AI Assistant with Twilio Programmable Messaging.\n\n### Web Chat\n\nIf you are using React, you can use our SDK to build a web chat for your\nAssistant in a few lines of code:\n\n    \n    \n    import { AssistantChat } from '@twilio-alpha/assistants-react'; export function App() { return <AssistantChat token=\"<token>\" assistantSid=\"<assistantSid>\" />; }\n\nIf you want to customize the UI or use other JavaScript frameworks, you'll be\nable to use the individual building blocks from our SDK.\n\n### iOS / Android\n\nAI Assistants integrates directly with Twilio Conversations. By using the\nTwilio Conversations SDKs for iOS and Android, you'll be able to connect your\nAI Assistant to your existing iOS and Android applications.\n\n### Custom Channels\n\nWe wouldn't be Twilio if we didn't give you the opportunity to wire up\nwhatever you can imagine. You can also use our API directly:\n\n    \n    \n    ASSISTANT_SID=<your-assistant-sid> curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \\ https://assistants.twilio.com/v1/$ASSISTANT_SID/Messages \\ -d '{\"Identity\":\"user_id:example\", \"SessionId\": \"demo\", \"Body\":\"Ahoy there\"}' \\ -u $TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID:$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN\n\nThe API will also be exposed throughout our various helper libraries across\nPython, Node.js, Go, Ruby, Java, .NET, and PHP.\n\n## What's Next\n\nStarting today, we are opening up our Developer Preview waitlist. We want to\nmake sure we build the best possible experience for you all, and as a result\nwe'll be onboarding developers on a rolling basis over the coming months. We\ncan\u2019t wait to get your feedback and have you help shape AI Assistants.\n\nWe still have many more things planned for AI Assistants, and can\u2019t wait to\nshare more with you.\n\nIf you want to be part of the Developer Preview, you can follow along with\nTwilio Alpha and sign up for our waitlist today!\n\nRachel Baskin is a Principal Project Manager on the Emerging Technology and\nInnovation team.
