As a result, I\u2019m left\nwith a lot of excitement. i3 felt super snappy and direct.\n\nI couldn\u2019t make the switch fully, mostly because I\u2019m clueless about how to\nmanage my settings for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. I didn\u2019t want to take that risk\nwith my work computer.\n\nThat being said, the experience made me question my Gnome setup and change a\nfew things.\n\n## Fast Workspace Switching\n\nWorkspaces are known as \u201cdesktops\u201d in macOS and Windows.\n\nI always found workspaces overwhelming. It\u2019s hard enough to arrange windows in\none workspace, why would I need another 5? However, i3 showed how much value\nyou can get out of them, if used differently.\n\nSee, i3 is a tiling window manager. \u201cwindows\u201d don\u2019t float and they don\u2019t ever\noverlap each other. i3\u2019s design physically limits your ability to open too\nmany windows in one workspace.\n\nThis sounds very limiting but that\u2019s where having multiple workspaces came\ninto play. Instead of opening a bunch of windows and cramming them into a\nsingle workspace, distribute them among many and use keyboard shortcuts to\nswitch between workspaces.\n\nFor example, I always keep my browser in workspace #1, code editor in\nworkspace #2, and terminals in workspace #3. It\u2019s now a muscle memory to hit\n\u201cAlt + 1\u201d to see my browser. This way, instead of hitting \u201cAlt + Tab\u201d multiple\ntimes to get the window I want, I can be more direct.\n\nThis changed my mental model from \u201cworkspaces increase desktop area you should\nmanage\u201d to \u201cworkspaces are just like switching apps, but more direct\u201d. This\nnever ocurred to me before, and it\u2019s a testament of trying new desktop\nenvironments.\n\nI have made the following tweaks in Settings > Multitasking.\n\nWorkspaces\n\nI switched to \u201cFixed number of workspaces\u201d. By default, the setting is\n\u201cDynamic workspaces\u201d, meaning the thrid workspace won\u2019t show up unless you\nhave a window open on the second one.\n\nSet the \u201cNumber of workspaces\u201d to 5. Why 5? I\u2019ll get to this later.\n\nMulti-Monitor\n\nI switched to \u201cWorkspaces on primary display only\u201d, which is only relevant if\nyou have multiple monitors. With the \u201cWorkspaces on all displays\u201d setting,\nswitching to a different workspace, will make this change on all displays. I\nfind this difficult to keep track.\n\nApp Switching\n\nThis settings is about which apps you\u2019ll get in your app switcher when you are\nhitting \u201cAlt + Tab\u201d. Including apps from all workspaces makes switching very\nslow because you have to tab through all the open apps. I don\u2019t want to see\napps from other workspaces that are not in my direct view.\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n### Alt + Number\n\nFrom Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts, I have updated Gnome\u2019s \u201cSwitch\nto workspace X\u201d shortcuts. Hitting Alt + 1, takes me to the first workspace,\nhitting Alt + 4, takes me to the fourth workspace.\n\nInterestingly, while supported, there is no way to add a shortcut for the\nfifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth workspaces. I think you can do this with a\nterminal command, but I haven\u2019t bothered.\n\nI have also set up Alt + 9 to go to the last workspace, which is the fifth\none. Hence, that\u2019s why I have set up the \u201cNumber of workspaces\u201d setting to 5.\n\nSimilarly, I\u2019ve set the \u201cMove window to workspace\u201d shortcuts in the \u201cShift +\nAlt + Number\u201d format.\n\n### Alt + U and Alt + I\n\nI have set these two shortcuts to switch to the workspace on the left and on\nthe right, however, I\u2019m not using them at all. Maybe they are useful to you.\n\n## Ctrl is mapped to Alt, Alt to Win\n\nIt\u2019s a personal preference, but highly recommended. It\u2019s difficult to hit Ctrl\nall day with your pinky, so I map it to Alt. That puts Alt under your pinky,\nwhich I also don\u2019t like, so I map Alt to the Win key.\n\nThis is very easy to do in Gnome, using the Tweaks tool. Go to Gnome Tweaks >\nKeyboard & Mouse > Additional Layout Options > Alt and Win Behavior.\n\nThis all depends on the shape of your keyboard. On some configurations,\nhitting \u201cAlt + 1\u201d is quite a reach. For the Apple Bluetooth keyboard I have,\nthis is not a problem.\n\n## Only Two Windows in a Workspace\n\ni3 stores everything in trees, therefore it can maintain a hierarchy between\nwindows on the display. It literally knows which window is on the right or\nleft, so you can focus on the one on the left or right. Gnome doesn\u2019t have\nsuch mechanism. All windows float on top of each other and there is no\nhierarchy.\n\nTherefore, I try to open two windows per workspace. This allows me to easily\n\u201cAlt + Tab\u201d between the two windows and bring them to focus. There is no third\nwindow I can accidentally bring to front. This makes it easier to quickly\nchange focus.\n\n## Other Settings\n\n### Reduced Animations\n\nWhile not madnatory, this increases the feeling of snapiness for me. So I\nreduced the animations in Settings > Accessibility > Seeing > Reduce\nAnimation.\n\n### Launcher\n\ni3 can run start any application using \u201cAlt + D\u201d. This is easy to implement in\nGnome by setting the Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Launchers >\nSearch shortcut.\n\n### Hide Dock (if on Ubuntu)\n\nSince we keep a minimal number of windows on the workspace, know which\nworkspace has which program running, and we can launch applications quickly\nusing the launcher shortcut, we don\u2019t need the dock.\n\nI set Settings > Ubuntu Desktop > Dock > Auto-hide the Dock.\n\nblog.cemunalan.com.tr\n\nYorumlar Y\u00fckleniyor...\n\n", "frontpage": false}
