Conversation, X/Kimochii Ai\n\nWhen Isenberg asked him what he loved about it, the Miami man is quoted as\nsaying: \u201cSome people play video games, I play with AI girlfriends.\u201d\n\n> The market cap for Match Group is $9B. Someone will build the AI-version of\n> Match Group and make $1B+.\n>\n> I met some guy last night in Miami who admitted to me that he spends\n> $10,000/month on \"AI girlfriends\".\n>\n> I thought he was kidding.

Fanvue/Emily Pellegrini\n\nCandy.ai bills itself as \u201cthe ultimate AI girlfriend experience\u201d which offers\n\u201cvirtual companions for immersive and personalized chats.\u201d\n\nKupid AI says that it uses AI algorithms to generate virtual and fictional\ncharacters \u2014 or \u201ccompanions\u201d \u2014 with whom one can communicate through voice\nnotes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kinda like dating apps. You\u2019re not on only one,\u201d the Miami man said.\n\nIsenberg said he was left \u201cspeechless\u201d by the encounter and predicted that\n\u201csomeone will build the AI-version of Match Group and make $1B+.\u201d\n\nMatch Group is the parent company of dating apps such as Tinder, Match.com,\nHinge, OkCupid and Plenty of Fish.\n\n4\n\nAI-generated girlfriends are becoming increasingly popular, according to\nsurveys. Fanvue/Amy Everharrt\n\nWebsites like Romance.AI offer up virtual dating partners using technology\nthat can mimic real-life human interactions.\n\nAn app such as Romantic AI \u201chelps you create the perfect girlfriend with whom\nyou share interests and views. You can talk about everything, get support and\nfeel needed.\u201d\n\nAnother app, Forever Companion, offers users the opportunity to chat with bots\nbased on popular social media influencers.\n\nReplika, the AI chatbot software, offers users the chance to create their own\nboyfriend or husband for just a few hundred dollars.\n\nPlatforms such as Nomi.ai and Soulmate even encourage erotic role play.\n\nUsers can personalize AI chatbot\u2019s avatar and give it personality traits\ndepending on whether they want a friend, mentor or romantic partner.\n\nThe nature of the messages could resemble \u201csexting\u201d so any erotic conversation\nwould have to include explicit instructions on what the user would like to\nhappen.\n\n4\n\nSome one in five Americans say they have chatted flirtatiously with an AI bot.\nFanvue/Hailey Lopez\n\nUnlike Replika, which has filters to stop people from using overtly sexual\nlanguage, Nomi.ai allows users to tailor the AI bot to their preferences by\ndeciding which clothing the avatar wears and how open they are to sexual\nactivity.\n\nUsers also have the option of making their chatbots submissive or dominant.\n\nA group of Gen Z TikTok users reported that they were \u201cfalling for\u201d DAN,\nChatGPT\u2019s alter ego with a flirty macho male voice that some have compared to\nChristian Grey from \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d\n\nA recent survey from Infobip found that nearly 20% of Americans have flirted\nwith chat bots. Nearly half of them \u2014 47.2% \u2014 did so out of curiosity while\n23.9% said they were lonely and seeking interactions.\n\nWhat do you think? Post a comment.\n\nNearly 17% said they were \u201cAI-phished\u201d \u2014 meaning they did not realize they\nwere talking to a chat bot.\n\nThe survey also found that 12.2% were seeking sexual chat within a private\nspace.\n\n### Share this article:\n\n  * Facebook\n  * Twitter\n  * Flipboard\n  * WhatsApp\n  * Email\n  * Copy\n\nFiled under\n\n  * artificial intelligence\n  * chatbots\n  * chatgpt\n  * 4/15/24\n\nRead Next NY Times ends probe into source of Israel-Gaza coverage le...\n\n## Columnists\n\n  * ### \n\nJennifer Gould\n\n#### NYC power lunch makes comeback as more workers return to office\n\n  * ### \n\nCharles Gasparino\n\n#### The \u2018short\u2019 story behind Donald Trump's Truth Social platform\n\n  * ### \n\nLydia Moynihan\n\n#### Ex-Clinton adviser Declan Kelly consulting on Boeing CEO search: 'Doesn't\nknow planes, but he knows disasters'\n\n### See All Columnists\n\n#### Trending Now in Business\n\n  * This story has been shared 3,500 times. 3,500\n\n### California fast-food franchisees worried they'll lose customers to\nChili's, Applebee's because of $20 minimum wage\n\n  * This story has been shared 3,056 times. 3,056\n\n### Tech exec predicts 'AI girlfriends' will create $1B business: 'Comfort at\nthe end of the day'\n\n  * This story has been shared 1,886 times. 1,886\n\n### Billionaire In-N-Out heiress claims she went 'toe-to-toe' to keep prices\ndown as Calif. fast food industry, prices slammed by minimum wage hike\n\n## Now on Page Six\n\n  * ### Zendaya rocks vintage Ralph Lauren dress first worn by Cindy Crawford to promote \u2018Challengers\u2019 in Italy\n\n  * ### Taylor Swift apologized to Travis Kelce for being drunk at Coachella: lip reader\n\n  * ### Bethenny Frankel admits she was \u2018relieved\u2019 that she had miscarriage during \u2018suffocating\u2019 Jason Hoppy marriage\n\nSee All\n\n#### Video\n\n  * ### Anti-Israel protesters wave Hezbollah flag in NYC\n\nAI-generated virtual girlfriends are on the cusp of becoming a billion-dollar\nindustry, according to a tech executive.
