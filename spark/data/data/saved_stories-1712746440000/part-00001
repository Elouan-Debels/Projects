We are motivated by the premise that a language model is likely\n> to identify verbatim excerpts from its training text. We propose DE-COP, a\n> method to determine whether a piece of copyrighted content was included in\n> training. DE-COP's core approach is to probe an LLM with multiple-choice\n> questions, whose options include both verbatim text and their paraphrases.\n> We construct BookTection, a benchmark with excerpts from 165 books published\n> prior and subsequent to a model's training cutoff, along with their\n> paraphrases. Our experiments show that DE-COP surpasses the prior best\n> method by 9.6% in detection performance (AUC) on models with logits\n> available. Moreover, DE-COP also achieves an average accuracy of 72% for\n> detecting suspect books on fully black-box models where prior methods give\n> \\approx 4% accuracy.
