On-board sensors to detect\nevery crinkle and puff that can possibly be gleaned from the environment.\nSelf-repairing and self-replicating, the human body is the most incredible\nmachine you will ever operate.\n\nThe field of bionic prostheses is unique in that its goals are preordained:\nthe body\u2019s form is celestial, its function, our guiding light. As researchers,\nwe seek to enable control and sensation of artificial limbs equal to their\nbiological counterparts. And though success means duplicating the\nexquisiteness of a musical composer like Liszt, the imagination readily leaps\nto encompass supraphysical notions such as the virtuosic performance of\n12-finger bionic compositions, or swimming at remarkable speeds via neural\ncontrol of artificial fins.\n\nEven if it is evident that high degrees of bionic integration require\ntechnological advancements in both mechatronic and biologic realms, pursuit of\nthe latter has been relatively neglected by the field at large. The\ndevelopment of powerful actuators, batteries, chips, and algorithms has far\noutpaced our ability to intuitively interface with them through neural\nconnection. Should we tap into the central brain directly? Or do peripheral\nnerves provide a more accessible port? What about muscles, skin, and all the\ncritical mechanoreceptors within our bodies that provide us rich\nproprioception and tactile sensation? While it is obvious that bionic limbs\nshould not be controlled via mouse and keyboard, there remains a debate in the\nfield of bionics as to the exact structure of a superior interface.\n\nIn a recent article published in Nature Reviews Bioengineering, we delve into\nmechanoneural interfaces, a new paradigm for bionic integration comprising\nsurgical combinations of soft tissue architectures involving muscles, nerves,\nand skin with synthetic components, such as implantable sensors and\nstimulators. We propose that mechanoneural interfaces increase physiological\nsignal selectivity and bandwidth between the brain and peripheral nervous\nsystem by leveraging the remarkable capabilities of soft tissues, including\nthe regenerative capacity of peripheral nerves and the ability of muscles to\nact as biophysical amplifiers of motor signals.\n\nThe basic operating principle of a mechanoneural interface is its ability to\nconvert neural signals into mechanical force (e.g., muscle contraction) or\nconvert mechanical force into neural signals (e.g., skin deformation). One\nexample of a mechanoneural interface is targeted sensory reinnervation,\nwherein a peripheral sensory nerve left over after amputation is introduced to\na denervated patch of skin. After reinnervation, simply touching the patch of\nskin may elicit cutaneous sensations that are perceived as originating from\nthe phantom limb. Another example is the agonist-antagonist myoneural\ninterface, wherein muscles that were naturally paired in the intact limb are\nsurgically relinked in the amputated limb to restore proprioception of the\nphantom limb to the user. Signals generated by these paired muscles are then\nused in harmony to control the joint of a bionic prosthesis. Both of these\nmechanoneural interfaces and many others have already been implemented in\npersons with amputation to yield more intuitive prosthetic integration with\nlower and upper extremity prostheses.\n\nLooking ahead, attaining fluency in the body\u2019s nuanced notation requires\ndeveloping specialized tools and techniques that further our understanding of\nsoft tissues, their regenerative capabilities, the biological signals\navailable, and the I/O required for their interfacing to limb prostheses. The\npursuit of more sophisticated mechanoneural interfaces will ultimately enhance\nthe phenomenon of prosthetic embodiment consisting of agency, or the awareness\nof the control of movement, and ownership, or the feeling that our body parts\nare inherently part of ourselves. Ultimately, we propose that principles\nlearned from studying mechanoneural interfaces and their functional outcomes\nwill yield a bionic information theory that will allow scientists and\nphysicians to advise patients on which mechanoneural interfacing techniques\nmaximize prosthetic embodiment. Through such advancements, limb prostheses\nwill become an integral part of self, transcending their role as mere\nassistive instruments.\n\nPublication Research\n\n## Mechanoneural interfaces for bionic integration\n\nShu, T., Herrera-Arcos, G., Taylor, C.R. et al.
