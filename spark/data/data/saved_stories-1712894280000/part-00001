But predicting when this will happen poses numerous challenges.\n\nCredit...Richie Pope\n\nBy Katherine Kornei\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nLeer en espa\u00f1ol\n\nThe total solar eclipse visible on Monday over parts of Mexico, the United\nStates and Canada was a perfect confluence of the sun and the moon in the sky.\nBut it\u2019s also the kind of event that comes with an expiration date: At some\npoint in the distant future, Earth will experience its last total solar\neclipse.\n\nThat\u2019s because the moon is drifting away from Earth, so our nearest celestial\nneighbor will one day, millions or even billions of years in the future,\nappear too small in the sky to completely obscure the sun.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll only ever have annular eclipses,\u201d said Noah Petro, a planetary\nscientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, referring to \u201cring of fire\u201d\neclipses like the one that crossed the Americas in October.\n\nBut putting an exact date on Earth\u2019s final total solar eclipse is a serious\ncomputational challenge involving a variety of scientific disciplines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nEver since the moon formed over four billion years ago, it has been spiraling\naway from Earth. The moon\u2019s retreat results from its gravitational\ninteractions with our planet. Tides raised by that gravity send the water in\nour planet\u2019s oceans sliding over the seafloor and along the edges of\ncontinents. That creates friction that causes Earth to spin more slowly on its\naxis, said Mattias Green, an ocean scientist at Bangor University in Wales.\n\nThe moon moves outward in its orbit in response to the slowing of the Earth.\nImagine a figure skater extending her arms and slowing down, Dr. Green said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same physical principle but backwards.\u201d\n\nOne of the first people to predict the expanding orbit of the moon was George\nDarwin, one of Charles Darwin\u2019s sons. But his hypothesis, published in 1879,\nwould not be verified until American astronauts and Soviet robotic rovers left\ndevices known as retroreflectors on the moon\u2019s surface. Researchers could fire\nlaser pulses at mirrors on those suitcase-size instruments and time how long\nit took the light to make a round trip. That gave scientists a way of\nprecisely measuring the distance to the moon. By the early 1970s, researchers\nhad discovered that the moon was receding from Earth by about 1.5 inches each\nyear.\n\nThat\u2019s about the rate at which human fingernails grow. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with\nextremely small changes,\u201d said Robert Tyler, a planetary scientist at NASA\nGoddard Space Flight Center.\n\nBut over hundreds of millions of years, the moon will become perceptibly\nsmaller in the sky as it grows more distant. At some point, it will appear too\nsmall to completely blot out the sun, and total solar eclipses will become a\nthing of the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo calculate the date of the last total solar eclipse, it is important to\nremember that both the moon\u2019s orbit around the Earth and Earth\u2019s orbit around\nthe sun are elliptical. That means that the distances between Earth and the\nmoon and between Earth and the Sun are not constant. The apparent sizes of the\nmoon and the sun as seen from Earth vary accordingly; the largest- and\nsmallest-looking moons differ in size by about 14 percent, while the\ncorresponding difference for the sun is about 3 percent.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse will occur when the largest-looking moon just\nbarely covers the smallest-looking sun. A bit of math involving the diameter\nof the moon and the apparent sizes of the moon and the sun yields an estimate\nfor that eventuality of approximately 620 million years.\n\nBut there is uncertainty in that number, researchers caution. It assumes, for\nstarters, that the moon will recede from Earth at its current rate. And that\nalmost certainly won\u2019t happen, Dr. Green said.\n\nThe moon\u2019s recession rate is affected by a slew of parameters, he said,\nincluding the length of a day on Earth, the depth of the ocean basins and the\narrangement of our continents. Those things change over time, Dr. Green said,\nso it is too simplistic to presume that the moon will always retreat at the\nsame pace.\n\nMost researchers agree that the moon\u2019s recession rate will probably decrease.\n\u201cIf I had to guess, the tides of the future will probably get weaker,\u201d said\nBrian Arbic, a physical oceanographer at the University of Michigan. Weaker\ntides translate into slower lunar retreat, which would buy our planet more\nopportunities to bask in the moon\u2019s umbral shadow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere\u2019s good evidence that the moon retreated more slowly in the past as well.\nMargriet Lantink, a geologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, has\nanalyzed sedimentary rocks in Australia that record climatic changes caused by\nfluctuations in the Earth-moon distance. \u201cI read the fingerprints of those\nastronomical variations,\u201d Dr. Lantink said.\n\nHer team\u2019s findings, and those of other researchers, have been used in\nsimulations that suggest the moon receded by about 0.4 to 1.2 inches per year\nfor much of its history. Those simulations also reveal that during some\nperiods lasting a few tens of millions of years, the moon hurtled away from\nEarth at more than four inches per year.\n\nDr. Tyler\u2019s models take on the daunting task of forecasting the future lunar\nrecession rate. They suggest that the moon will drift away at around 0.3\ninches per year on average for the next several billion years. And the moon\u2019s\nretreat in the future won\u2019t be nearly as variable as it was in the ancient\npast, he said. \u201cMost of the interesting stuff happened already.\u201d\n\nIf Dr. Tyler\u2019s simulations are correct, total eclipses will remain visible for\nabout three billion years. He cautioned that there is significant uncertainty\nin that estimate.\n\nAnd though we likely have eons left to experience total eclipses, that\u2019s no\nexcuse for not seeking out their splendor, Dr. Petro said. After all, they\u2019re\na celestial phenomenon that\u2019s unique to our Earthly existence.\n\n\u201cNo other planet in our solar system has total solar eclipses,\u201d Dr. Petro\nsaid. \u201cWe have this wonderful opportunity.\u201d\n\nA version of this article appears in print on April 2, 2024, Section D, Page 7 of the New York edition with the headline: The Last Solar Show: A 3-Body Calculation.
