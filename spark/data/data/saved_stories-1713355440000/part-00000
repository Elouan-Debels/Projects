You can't be doing that,'\" said Joanne.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Couple shocked after tow truck tries to nab their moving car in SF\n\nAn East Bay couple is detailing the terrifying turn of events when a tow truck\ntried to tow them while driving through downtown San Francisco.\n\nA yellow tow truck began to back up and tried to hook their vehicle. Joanne\nsaid they were waiting at a red light in San Francisco.\n\n\"He started backing up and his lever came down and basically he was just\nbacking up trying to latch onto our car,\" said Joanne.\n\nSan Francisco City Attorney David Chiu confirmed the towing company \"Specialty\nTowing\" is known to their office for violating state laws prior to this\nincident.\n\n\"This company appears to be the same towing company that my office previously\nmoved to suspend and debar from receiving city contracts,\" said Chiu.\n\nAfter viewing the video, Chiu said the latest incident is illegal.\n\n\"It could likely be violating a number of laws - potentially criminal laws,\"\nsaid Chiu. \"The fact that we have seen yet another way in which this company\nis violating the law - unfortunately it's not surprising, but the video is\nshocking nonetheless.\"\n\nPrior to this incident, the city received complaints from multiple victims who\nwere allegedly scammed by Specialty Towing.\n\nMORE: New San Francisco program will text you if your car is about to be towed\n\nThe city proceeded to block Specialty Towing and two other towing companies\nunder the same ownership from working with the city on enforcing parking laws.\n\n\"Specialty Towing is an affiliated company with a company called Auto Towing.\nThey are all essentially part of the same operation. Auto Towing had illegally\nbeen towing cars off a private lot without the permission of the property\nowner. On top of that, they were strictly limiting the hours during which cars\ncould be picked up and pressuring the owners to pay in cash,\" said Chiu.\n\nABC7 News called Specialty Towing's phone number that appeared on one of the\ntrucks and the operator hung up on us. We showed up at Auto Towing in the\nBayview, searching for answers.\n\nOn the phone, we were told Auto Towing is no longer in business and the person\non the phone said they were not connected to Specialty Towing.\n\nSFPD is now urging other victims to come forward.\n\n\"It is insane. We do ask the victims if they have encountered something like\nthis to contact the police department immediately,\" said officer Paulina\nHenderson with SFPD.\n\nThe city attorney said Specialty Towing allegedly also defrauded San Francisco\ntaxpayers to receive welfare benefits.\n\nIn this case, it's still unclear why the couple was targeted. The couple said\nthey filed a police report and confirmed the car is paid off as well as the\nregistration.\n\nIf you're on the ABC7 News app, click here to watch live\n\nReport a correction or typo\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 KGO-TV.
