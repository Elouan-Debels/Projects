These queries can be time-consuming to\nwrite and challenging to maintain. At Snowflake, we believe in making the\npower of data accessible to all. That\u2019s why we prioritize simplicity,\ngovernance and quality in everything we build \u2013 including our AI-powered\ntools. We\u2019re thrilled to announce the public preview of Snowflake Copilot, a\nnew solution on the bleeding edge of text-to-SQL that simplifies data analysis\nwhile maintaining robust governance. Get ready to see Copilot in action at the\nSnowflake Data Cloud Summit this June 2024!\n\n### Snowflake Copilot: Your AI-powered SQL assistant\n\nSince the private preview announcement at Snowday in November 2023, Copilot\nhas taken a major leap forward in its public preview release (limited\navailability in AWS US regions \u2013 see docs for details). Leveraging\nbreakthroughs from Snowflake\u2019s world-class, AI research team, this innovative\nsolution combines the strengths of Mistral\u2019s latest state-of-the-art model,\nMistral Large, with Snowflake\u2019s proprietary SQL generation model. This unique\nsynergy pushes the boundaries of data exploration, empowering you with an\nunparalleled AI assistant.\n\n#### Here\u2019s what sets Copilot apart:\n\nSnowflake understands the complexities of writing SQL better than anyone.\nProcessing over 4 billion queries running daily on our platform (as of January\n31, 2024) [1] gives us unparalleled insights into the most complex data\nchallenges. This vast amount of data fuels the development of Copilot,\nsurpassing typical large language models. Not only do we have a unique vantage\npoint into the challenges faced by data analysts, we also possess rich\nmetadata that feeds into Snowflake\u2019s dedicated text-to-SQL model that Copilot\nleverages in combination with Mistral\u2019s technology.\n\nIn essence, Copilot acts as an intelligent assistant that understands the\ncontext of your data, resulting in more accurate and relevant SQL code\nsuggestions (based on internal testing) that can boost your productivity. The\npowerful combination between Snowflake and Mistral unlocks new use cases and\nbrings you improved capabilities:\n\nEffortless text-to-SQL: Simply ask Copilot your data questions in plain\nEnglish, and it will generate the corresponding SQL queries for you. This\nempowers users to write SQL queries faster than ever and analyze data with\nease.\n\nEnhanced accuracy: Through continuous refinements to Copilot\u2019s modeling\narchitecture, we\u2019ve enhanced its ability to understand user needs. This\ncombination of Snowflake\u2019s proprietary SQL generation model and Mistral Large\nin Copilot is on the frontier for complex real-world SQL generation tasks.\n\nData exploration: You can now ask Copilot in plain English to explore your\ndata. Ask open-ended questions about the structure of your data, refine your\nanalysis with follow-up inquiries and gain deeper insights \u2013 all without\nwriting complex queries.\n\nIntelligent corrections: Copilot empowers you to write cleaner, more efficient\nSQL queries. It suggests optimizations, provides explanations, and even\nrecommends fixes for potential issues in your existing queries. This\ncomprehensive functionality streamlines your workflow and enables high-quality\ndata analyses.\n\nSnowflake documentation: Copilot can now answer any questions you have about\nSnowflake documentation. So whether you\u2019re looking for a specific function,\nwould like to learn more about existing features and capabilities, or want to\nhone your SQL skills \u2013 Copilot has you covered with comprehensive Snowflake\nknowledge.\n\n### Seamless AI within Snowflake\n\nCopilot is a complete solution designed to seamlessly integrate with your\nexisting Snowflake workflow. This eliminates the need for external LLMs,\nkeeping your data analysis entirely within Snowflake\u2019s secure environment.\nIt\u2019s readily available alongside your familiar development interfaces,\nstarting with SQL worksheets. Our vision extends beyond worksheets, and we\u2019re\nactively working to make Copilot a ubiquitous companion in Snowflake.\n\nPowered by Snowflake Cortex, Copilot leverages advanced technologies like\nmixed models and efficient GPU processing behind the scenes. This aligns\nperfectly with Snowflake\u2019s core mission: democratizing access to the power of\nAI and empowering everyone to unlock deeper data insights.\n\n### Looking ahead: The future of natural language and data\n\nThe field of text-to-SQL is undergoing rapid innovation. Snowflake\u2019s AI\nresearch team is at the forefront, exploring the intricacies of building a\npowerful SQL LLM. We\u2019re committed to pushing the boundaries. Our approach\nisn\u2019t limited to a single model \u2013 we constantly investigate and test new\npossibilities. We leverage any combination of models, or even entirely new\napproaches, to improve Copilot\u2019s SQL generation quality and functionality.\n\nWe believe Snowflake Copilot represents a significant step towards a future\nwhere natural language becomes the primary interface for data analysis.\nHowever, this is just the beginning. We encourage you to try the public\npreview of Snowflake Copilot and share your feedback. Your insights will be\ninvaluable as we continue to refine Copilot for general availability (GA).\n\nReady to experience the future of data analysis with Snowflake Copilot?
