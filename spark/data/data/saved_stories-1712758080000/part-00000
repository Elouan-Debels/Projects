Built 1959\u201368, not listed\n\nBuilt according to plans by Spence, Blocks A and B, housing the Magnox\nreactors, were intended to convey an allusion to medieval castles in the wild\nrugged landscape.

Designed by architect Robert Harvey. Built 1967, not listed\n\nSitting in the open countryside of Flintshire and originally called Shire\nHall, this building features an inventive grid of heavily cast concrete window\napertures that bring a strong graphic quality to an otherwise minimal facade.\nIn 2020, the rear wings were unceremoniously demolished in a cost-cutting\nexercise\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\n\n  * ## Margam Crematorium, Port Talbot. Designed by FD Williamson & Associates of Porthcawl. Built 1969, listed Grade II*\n\nThe crematorium sits in beautifully landscaped grounds and is a stunning\nensemble of geometric forms in ribbed rusticated concrete. The composition is\nfurther enhanced by the varying angles of the mono-pitched roofs and flashes\nof intense colour from the stained glass in the chapels\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\n\n  * ## George Street Bridge, Newport. Designed by Mott, Hay & Anderson. Built 1962\u201364, listed Grade II*\n\nA major civil engineering structure, the bridge traverses the River Usk and is\nthe first example of a cable-stayed cantilever bridge in the United Kingdom\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\n\n  * ## Brambell Building, Bangor University. Designed by Sir Percy Thomas & Partners. Built 1969, not listed\n\nRegular concrete columns stride along the elevations linking the strong\nhorizontals of its inverted ziggurat form and lending it a classical air. The\nbuilding\u2019s design draws stylistic parallels to the Boston City Hall of 1968 by\nKallmann, McKinnell & Knowles, though on a more modest scale, befitting a\ncathedral city in north Wales\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\n\n  * ## Bell Tower (La Campanile), Aberystwyth University. Designed by Dale Owen, Percy Thomas Partnership. Built 1970, not listed\n\nThe Bell Tower is situated on a concourse that is also the site of the great\nhall and the university library. Completed in 1970, the ensemble is arguably\none of the Percy Thomas Partnership\u2019s finest contributions to the architecture\nof Wales and was awarded the Riba gold medal in 1972. In 2003, the tower was\njoined by \u2018La Scala\u2019, an award-winning sculpture by Ben Pimlott, which\nfunctions as a large-scale artwork and also as seating\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\n\n  * ## Theatr Ardudwy, Coleg Harlech. Designed by Colwyn Foulkes and Partners. Built 1970\u201373, listed Grade II*\n\nBuilt on the coastal hills of Harlech, the theatre makes dramatic use of a\nsteeply sloping site and is within view of Harlech Castle, which provides an\nhistoric counterpoint. The striking composition of the brutalist theatre is\nthe design of local architect Ralph Colwyn Foulkes and houses a main\nauditorium that seats 266 with richly finished interiors. Sadly the theatre\nhas now been closed for some years\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\n\n  * ## Margam Steel Works (now Tata Steel) Port Talbot. Designed by Sir Percy Thomas and Son. Built 1948\u201352, not listed\n\nThis showcase for the newly nationalised heavy industries opened in 1951. The\nmills, blast furnaces, new deep harbour and various ancillary blocks, water-\ntowers and coke plants exemplified a pioneering approach to industrial\narchitecture and the works became the major employer of the town. This status\nis now compromised by current management\u2019s decision to close the blast\nfurnaces while the transition to electric arc furnaces is made, which will\ncost up to 2,800 jobs\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\n\n  * ## Fairwater Shopping Precinct. Designed by Gordon Redfern, Cwmbran Development Corporation. Built 1967, not listed\n\nFairwater was one of a series of smaller shopping centres developed by the CDC\nas local hubs providing healthcare, shops, playgrounds and public housing. The\nprecinct was considered innovative and ambitious, although architecture critic\nIan Nairn deemed it a \u2018kind of in-turned medieval village\u2019\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\n\n  * ## Port Talbot Bypass (J39 to J41). Designed by the Ministry of Transport. Built 1963-66\n\nOpened in 1966, the 4.5 mile-long stretch of motorway that forms the Port\nTalbot Bypass is a major intervention in the urban fabric of the town that\ninvolved the demolition of three chapels and more than 200 houses to raise the\nmotorway 15 metres above the rooftops\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\n\n  * ## The Crown Buildings (Cathays Park Buildings). Designed by Alex Gordon and Partners. Built 1972-79, not listed\n\nThis building is a strikingly monumental addition to Cathays Park, aligning\nwith its surroundings through the use of stone and maintaining a consistent\nheight with neighbouring structures. However its overall design then diverges,\npaying homage to outlines reminiscent of contemporary American architecture,\nnotably Boston City Hall\n\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\n\n  * ## West Glamorgan County Hall (now Swansea Civic Centre). Designed by J Webb, Charles W Quick, the County Architects Department. Built 1979-84, not listed\n\nOverlooking Swansea Bay, this imposing concrete-framed brutalist megastructure\nrises to five storeys, featuring continuous bands of glazing contrasting with\ndeep washed calcined flint pre-cast panels above and below.
