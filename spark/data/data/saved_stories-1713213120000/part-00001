Experts say the US government\u2019s reliance on its systems\nmeans the company continues to get a free pass.\n\nPhotograph: Joan Cros/Getty Images\n\nWhen Microsoft revealed in January that foreign government hackers had once\nagain breached its systems, the news prompted another round of recriminations\nabout the security posture of the world\u2019s largest tech company.\n\nDespite the angst among policymakers, security experts, and competitors,\nMicrosoft faced no consequences for its latest embarrassing failure. The\nUnited States government kept buying and using Microsoft products, and senior\nofficials refused to publicly rebuke the tech giant. It was another reminder\nof how insulated Microsoft has become from virtually any government\naccountability, even as the Biden administration vows to make powerful tech\nfirms take more responsibility for America\u2019s cyberdefense.\n\nThat state of affairs is unlikely to change even in the wake of a new report\nby the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a group of government and industry\nexperts, which lambasts Microsoft for failing to prevent one of the worst\nhacking incidents in the company\u2019s recent history. The report says Microsoft\u2019s\n\u201csecurity culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul.\u201d\n\nFeatured Video\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s almost untouchable position is the result of several intermingling\nfactors. It is by far the US government\u2019s most important technology supplier,\npowering computers, document drafting, and email conversations everywhere from\nthe Pentagon to the State Department to the FBI. It is a critical partner in\nthe government\u2019s cyberdefense initiatives, with almost unparalleled insights\nabout hackers\u2019 activities and sweeping capabilities to disrupt their\noperations. And its executives and lobbyists have relentlessly marketed the\ncompany as a leading force for a digitally safer world.\n\nThese enviable advantages help explain why senior government officials have\nrefused to criticize Microsoft even as Russian and Chinese government-linked\nhackers have repeatedly breached the company\u2019s computer systems, according to\ncybersecurity experts, lawmakers, former government officials, and employees\nof Microsoft\u2019s competitors.\n\nThese people\u2014some of whom requested anonymity to candidly discuss the US\ngovernment and their industry\u2019s undisputed behemoth\u2014argue that the\ngovernment\u2019s relationship with Microsoft is crippling Washington\u2019s ability to\nfend off major cyberattacks that jeopardize sensitive data and threaten vital\nservices. To hear them tell it, Microsoft is overdue for oversight.\n\n## A History of Breaches and Controversy\n\nMicrosoft has a long track record of security breaches, but the past few years\nhave been particularly bad for the company.\n\nIn 2021, Chinese government hackers discovered and used flaws in Microsoft\u2019s\nemail servers to hack the company\u2019s customers, later releasing the flaws\npublicly to spark a feeding frenzy of attacks. In 2023, China broke into the\nemail accounts of 22 federal agencies, spying on senior State Department\nofficials and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo ahead of multiple US delegation\ntrips to Beijing. Three months ago, Microsoft revealed that Russian government\nhackers had used a simple trick to access the emails of some Microsoft senior\nexecutives, cyber experts, and lawyers. Last month, the company said that\nattack also compromised some of its source code and \u201csecrets\u201d shared between\nemployees and customers. On Thursday, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA) confirmed that those customers included federal\nagencies, and issued an emergency directive warning agencies whose emails were\nexposed to look for signs that the Russian hackers were attempting to use\nlogin credentials contained in those emails.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nRoku Breach Hits 567,000 Users\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Security\n\nHow Israel Defended Against Iran's Drone and Missile Attack\n\nBrian Barrett\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nThese incidents occurred as security experts were increasingly criticizing\nMicrosoft for failing to promptly and adequately fix flaws in its products. As\nby far the biggest technology provider for the US government, Microsoft\nvulnerabilities account for the lion\u2019s share of both newly discovered and most\nwidely used software flaws. Many experts say Microsoft is refusing to make the\nnecessary cybersecurity improvements to keep up with evolving challenges.\n\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t \u201cadapted their level of security investment and their mindset\nto fit the threat,\u201d says one prominent cyber policy expert. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge\nfuckup by somebody that has the resources and the internal engineering\ncapacity that Microsoft does.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security\u2019s CSRB endorsed this view in its new\nreport on the 2023 Chinese intrusion, saying Microsoft exhibited \u201ca corporate\nculture that deprioritized both enterprise security investments and rigorous\nrisk management.\u201d The report also criticized Microsoft for publishing\ninaccurate information about the possible causes of the latest Chinese\nintrusion.\n\nThe recent breaches reveal Microsoft\u2019s failure to implement basic security\ndefenses, according to multiple experts.\n\nAdam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the security firm\nCrowdStrike, points to the Russians\u2019 ability to jump from a testing\nenvironment to a production environment. \u201cThat should never happen,\u201d he says.\nAnother cyber expert who works at a Microsoft competitor highlighted China\u2019s\nability to snoop on multiple agencies\u2019 communications through one intrusion,\nechoing the CSRB report, which criticized Microsoft\u2019s authentication system\nfor allowing broad access with a single sign-in key.\n\n\u201cYou don't hear about these types of breaches coming out of other cloud\nservice providers,\u201d Meyers says.\n\nAccording to the CSRB report, Microsoft has \u201cnot sufficiently prioritized\nrearchitecting its legacy infrastructure to address the current threat\nlandscape.\u201d\n\nIn response to written questions, Microsoft tells WIRED that it\u2019s aggressively\nimproving its security to address recent incidents.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to adapting to the evolving threat landscape and partnering\nacross industry and government to defend against these growing and\nsophisticated global threats,\u201d says Steve Faehl, chief technology officer for\nMicrosoft\u2019s federal security business.\n\nAs part of its Secure Future Initiative launched in November, Faehl says,\nMicrosoft has improved its ability to automatically detect and block abuses of\nemployee accounts, begun scanning for more types of sensitive information in\nnetwork traffic, reduced the access granted by individual authentication keys,\nand created new authorization requirements for employees seeking to create\ncompany accounts.\n\nMicrosoft has also redeployed \u201cthousands of engineers\u201d to improve its products\nand has begun convening senior executives for status updates at least twice\nweekly, Faehl says.\n\nThe new initiative represents Microsoft\u2019s \u201croadmap and commitments to answer\nmuch of what the CSRB report called out as priorities,\u201d Faehl says. Still,\nMicrosoft does not accept that its security culture is broken, as the CSRB\nreport argues. \u201cWe very much disagree with this characterization,\u201d Faehl says,\n\u201cthough we do agree that we haven\u2019t been perfect and have work to do.\u201d\n\n## A Security Revenue \u2018Addiction\u2019\n\nMicrosoft has earned special enmity from the cybersecurity community for\ncharging its customers extra for better security protections like threat\nmonitoring, antivirus, and user access management. In January 2023, the\ncompany touted that its security division had passed $20 billion in annual\nrevenue.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has shifted to looking at cybersecurity as something that's meant\nto generate revenue for them,\u201d says Juan Andr\u00e9s Guerrero-Saade, associate vice\npresident of research at security firm SentinelOne. His colleague Alex Stamos\nrecently wrote that Microsoft\u2019s \u201caddiction\u201d to this revenue \u201chas seriously\nwarped their product design decisions.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nRoku Breach Hits 567,000 Users\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Security\n\nHow Israel Defended Against Iran's Drone and Missile Attack\n\nBrian Barrett\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nThese tensions exploded into the open in early 2021, as Congress and the new\nBiden administration scrambled to understand Russia\u2019s far-reaching SolarWinds\nhacking campaign.\n\nAfter breaching government networks through SolarWinds software, Moscow\u2019s\noperatives fooled Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform into granting them expansive\naccess. Because most agencies weren\u2019t paying for Microsoft\u2019s premium service\ntier, they didn\u2019t have the network activity logs necessary to detect these\nintrusions. Lawmakers were outraged that Microsoft was charging the government\nextra for such a basic feature, and Biden administration officials spent the\nnext two and a half years privately urging Microsoft to make log data free for\nall customers. Microsoft finally agreed to do so last July\u2014eight days after\nannouncing yet another major hack, this one discovered by an agency paying for\nlog data.\n\nMicrosoft won\u2019t say if it plans to make other premium security features free\nfor all of its customers. \u201cWe continue to raise the built-in security of our\nproducts and services to benefit customers,\u201d Faehl says.\n\nAsked about experts\u2019 arguments that Microsoft\u2019s strategy of profiting off of\ncybersecurity is incompatible with a security-first mindset, Faehl says, \u201cWe\nwould disagree with that characterization.\u201d\n\n## A System That\u2019s Everywhere\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s dominance has prompted concerns that it represents a single point\nof failure, concentrating America\u2019s technology dependence in such a way that\nhackers could easily sabotage essential services by targeting one company\u2019s\nproducts.\n\nFew services better illustrate the government\u2019s overwhelming dependence on\nMicrosoft\u2014and an area where some experts say a more diversified approach would\nbe safer\u2014than email. A former US cybersecurity official who works at one of\nMicrosoft\u2019s competitors predicts that an attack crippling Microsoft\u2019s email\nplatform would significantly reduce the government\u2019s ability to operate.\n\nWarnings about a Microsoft \u201cmonoculture\u201d date back two decades, but the idea\nis now attracting new attention from policymakers.\n\n\u201cThe US government\u2019s dependence on Microsoft poses a serious threat to US\nnational security,\u201d says US senator Ron Wyden. \u201cThe government is effectively\nstuck with the company\u2019s products, despite multiple serious breaches of US\ngovernment systems by foreign hackers caused by the company\u2019s negligence.\u201d\n\nLast Monday, Wyden announced draft legislation that would set a four-year\ndeadline for the federal government to stop buying collaboration technology\nlike Microsoft Office that critics say doesn\u2019t integrate well with competing\nservices.\n\nReducing the government\u2019s reliance on a single vendor wouldn\u2019t just benefit\nthe government, experts say. It would also spread the attack risk across more\ncompanies, taking some of the pressure off of Microsoft to protect such a vast\nportfolio of systems. The giant target on Microsoft\u2019s back makes it a magnet\nfor cybercriminals and government hackers, which helps explain its outsize\nnumber of breaches.\n\nThe government\u2019s reliance on Microsoft also entrenches a sense of familiarity\nwith its products that cements its places in federal networks. While some\nagencies are exploring alternatives to Microsoft, most of them are sticking\nwith what they know\u2014largely because it\u2019s easier than switching to an\nalternative platform, the former cyber official says.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nRoku Breach Hits 567,000 Users\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Security\n\nHow Israel Defended Against Iran's Drone and Missile Attack\n\nBrian Barrett\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nMicrosoft denies making it difficult for customers to switch to or incorporate\ncompetitors\u2019 products. \u201cOur competitors often stoke subjective complaints\nabout \u2018compatibility,\u2019\u201d Faehl says, but \u201cwe hear this more from the vendors of\nsome third-party products\u201d than from customers trying to use them.\n\nRegardless, experts say, the upshot is clear: The government is dependent on\nMicrosoft, robbing it of the leverage needed to push back on the company\u2019s\npractices.\n\n## Working the Refs\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t counting on its market dominance alone to defang government\noversight. Since its antitrust battles with the government in the 1990s, the\ncompany has crafted a sophisticated public policy strategy that combines\nearnest calls to protect cyberspace with omnipresent participation in\ngovernment initiatives.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is by far the slickest operation out there in tech when it comes to\nthese issues,\u201d says Andrew Grotto, a former senior White House cyber official\nwho now leads Stanford University\u2019s Program on Geopolitics, Technology, and\nGovernance and consults for some of Microsoft\u2019s competitors. \u201cThey learned\nthis lesson 25 years ago and have been applying it ever since.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s threat intelligence team, which knows more about malicious cyber\nactivity than virtually any other company and most governments, regularly\npublishes research about cyber threats and collaborates with law enforcement\non operations to dismantle hackers\u2019 infrastructure. The company also helps\nfund groups like the CyberPeace Institute, which advocates for a safer\ninternet and helps defend nongovernment organizations from hackers. And it has\npositioned itself as a helpful partner to policymakers who want to take on\ncyber issues but don\u2019t know where to start, sometimes providing lawmakers with\ndraft legislative language.\n\nWith its market dominance and political savvy, Microsoft has ensured that\nofficials almost never publicly criticize it, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe government's uncomfortable saying bad things about Microsoft because\nthey're fully committed to them,\u201d says Mark Montgomery, senior director of the\nCenter on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of\nDemocracies, a think tank.\n\nThe Biden administration has spoken grandly about wielding the government\u2019s\nformidable contracting power to force companies to improve their security. But\nwith Microsoft, that leverage is nonexistent, experts say. \u201cThere is no\nrealistic chance that the government will wholesale cancel its contracts with\nMicrosoft,\u201d Paul Rosenzweig, a cyber consultant and former DHS policy\nofficial, says in an email.\n\nMicrosoft disputes this argument. \u201cThe idea that the government is too\ndependent on Microsoft is at odds with reality,\u201d Faehl says.\n\nThe government\u2019s lack of leverage means federal officials never use the kind\nof blunt language found in the CSRB report when discussing Microsoft, even\nwhen they insist on speaking to reporters anonymously. The result is a\nremarkable display of government deference to Microsoft.\n\nAfter Chinese hackers broke into government email systems and eluded agencies\nnot paying for Microsoft\u2019s premium security features, a senior official at\nCISA acknowledged that Microsoft\u2019s business model was \u201cnot yielding the sort\nof security outcomes that we seek,\u201d but they declined to directly rebuke\nMicrosoft, instead sticking to talking points about productive conversations\nwith the company.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Security\n\nRoku Breach Hits 567,000 Users\n\nAndy Greenberg\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Quest to Map the Inside of the Proton\n\nCharlie Wood\n\n  * Security\n\nHow Israel Defended Against Iran's Drone and Missile Attack\n\nBrian Barrett\n\n  * Culture\n\nThe 16 Best Movies on Amazon Prime Right Now\n\nMatt Kamen\n\nIn fact, despite Microsoft\u2019s yearslong defiance of CISA\u2019s high-profile push\nfor companies to be \u201csecure by design,\u201d CISA has steadfastly refused to\ncriticize Microsoft\u2019s failures. When Microsoft finally bowed to pressure and\nmade logs free last July, CISA director Jen Easterly said she was \u201cextremely\npleased with Microsoft\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nThe former cyber official finds the government\u2019s meekness remarkable. \u201cWhen\ntheir own emails are stolen, they don\u2019t seem to push back on the vendor who is\nthe cause of that.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s National Security Council declined to comment for this\nstory. In a statement, Eric Goldstein, CISA\u2019s executive assistant director for\ncybersecurity, says his agency \u201chas a robust partnership with Microsoft and\nwill continue to collaborate in many areas,\u201d while also continuing to \u201cimpress\nupon all technology companies the urgency of developing products that are\nsecure by design so that consumers can trust the safety and integrity of the\ntechnology that they use every day.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Faehl says his company is \u201ccommitted to secure by design and\nsecure by default.\u201d\n\n## Forcing Change\n\nThe CSRB report on Microsoft\u2019s cloud breach calls for dramatic changes to the\ncompany\u2019s security culture. According to many experts, it\u2019s time for the\ngovernment to find its spine and compel those changes.\n\n\u201cBig, powerful companies in general don\u2019t change their behavior unless they\u2019re\nincentivized to do so,\u201d Stanford University\u2019s Grotto says.\n\nThe CSRB report recommends tough new requirements for cloud providers like\nMicrosoft, including periodic security reviews after they receive federal\ncontracts. Experts say those requirements could shift corporate incentives in\nfavor of better security.\n\nMicrosoft seems to realize that its recent breaches have sparked a public\nrelations crisis. \u201cWe expect and welcome fair scrutiny,\u201d says Faehl. \u201cAs an\nindustry leader we must be accountable for the security of our products and\nservices.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he says, Microsoft \u201cwouldn\u2019t mind seeing some scrutiny\u201d of\nits competitors who \u201cseek to sow fear, uncertainty and doubt about our\nposition as a way to seek advantage for their own products.\u201d\n\nTaking on Microsoft would also be a way for the Biden administration to live\nup to the principles in its National Cybersecurity Strategy, which prioritizes\nshifting the burden of cybersecurity onto large, well-resourced tech vendors.\n\u201cThey make the point ... that this balance needs to shift,\u201d Grotto says. \u201cThe\nquestion now is, \u2018Okay, what does administration do with that diagnosis?\u2019\u201d\n\nThere are signs that the administration is heeding this advice. During a\nbriefing with reporters on Thursday about the possibility that Russian\noperatives stole government secrets through their latest Microsoft hack,\nGoldstein said that CISA and other agencies are \u201care working closely with\nMicrosoft, in alignment with the recommendations of the Cyber Safety Review\nBoard, to drive further progress in Microsoft\u2019s improvement plans with their\nbroader security culture and enterprise.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, experts say, the status quo allows Microsoft to shirk\nresponsibility for problems that it is uniquely capable of resolving.\n\n\u201cNo harm comes from doing nothing, at least not to these companies,\u201d Guerrero-\nSaade of SentinelOne says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s going to destroy us.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI\n\n  * Hackers found a way to open 3 million hotel keycard locks\n\n  * A couple decided to decarbonize their home.
