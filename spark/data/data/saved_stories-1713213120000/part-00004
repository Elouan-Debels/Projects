Hulme\n\nAI is certainly shaking up corporate recruitment. Whether it\u2019s how AI parses\nresume databases, automatically ranks and prioritizes candidates, or how it\neven proactively matches resumes on file with relevant job openings through a\nsemantic vetting of worker skills against job requirements. All of that has\nbeen underway for some time. But what if AI could help organizations and job\nseekers alike ditch the resume altogether?\n\nThat\u2019s certainly a hope held by Barb Hyman, founder and CEO at Sapia.ai, a\ncompany that\u2019s built an AI-powered conversational interviewing platform that\nhelps organizations find and hire talent \u2014 Hyman says \u2014 in a fair and unbiased\nway.\n\nAfter working a handful of careers, including being a lawyer, marketer and\nhuman resources professional \u2014 Hyman decided it was time for her to help\nothers better develop their careers and help businesses attract and retain the\ntalent they need to succeed. Hyman started her career in law and then went\ninto management consulting after completing her MBA at Melbourne Business\nSchool and a law degree at Monash University. Hyman worked as a solicitor for\nfour years, then moved on to the Boston Consulting Group and eventually worked\nas executive general manager people and culture at REA Group.\n\n\u201cAt BCG and REA Group, I learned that people are not on your balance sheet,\nbut they walk out the door every day. And you\u2019re terrified whether they\u2019re\ngoing to come back. And it costs so much to bring people in, develop them, and\ntrain them,\u201d says Hyman. \u201cAnd the process seemed quite inhuman to me. And,\nfrom a human resources perspective, it is extremely costly, especially in\nterms of people\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nHyman explains that she wanted to fix that and to bring more humanity to the\nhiring process, especially when it came to fitting the right people with the\nright jobs and doing so while eliminating the high levels of bias that are\ncommon in traditional hiring processes. \u201cI entered into a partnership with a\ndata scientist who had the brains and the experience to figure out how to make\nbetter people decisions.\u201d\n\nSponsorships Available\n\nThe result is Sapia.ai and its Smart Interviewer platform. Smart Interviewer\nis based on a proprietary machine learning system that relies on NLP (natural\nlanguage processing) to interview and assess candidate\u2019s responses against\nskills, values and behaviors the hiring entity seeks. After completing the\nchat interview, leading candidates progress to a video interview.\n\nFollowing the chat interview, all candidates receive personalized insights\nabout their personalities, strengths, developmental areas and coaching tips\nbased on their responses.\n\nAccording to Sapia.ai, scored candidate profiles can be integrated with the\nemployer\u2019s applicant tracking system or HR management software. Hiring teams\ncan review the AI-generated profile transcripts and optionally conduct\nadditional video interviews for shortlisted candidates on Sapia.ai\u2019s platform.\n\nWe recently met with Sapia.ai\u2019s CEO to get a sense of why she founded the\ncompany and how AI can help both employers and candidates \u2014 as well as\npotentially put an end to the resume. Below is an edited version of our\nconversation.\n\nThank you for taking the time with us. Let\u2019s start with how Sapia.ai got\nstarted.\n\nPeople try very hard not to be biased, but most of our biases are not\nconscious. So, how can we interrupt biases and try to get to better decisions?\nFairer decisions? At the same time, create a way of engaging with people,\nstarting with hiring, that was beautiful, empowering, dignifying, and fair. We\ntook two years to build this product. The core product is what we call Chat\nInterview, and the platform is called Smart Interviewer.\n\nIt\u2019s a revolution in hiring. It\u2019s something that\u2019s based on actual science and\na dataset that we\u2019ve curated and collected over time. To date, no one has\nmanaged to replicate [what we\u2019ve done] because the basis of it comes from\ndata. And while now the whole world understands the value of data [for\nhiring]. But back then, no one did.\n\nOur technology helps to identify how well someone will fit. What [hiring\ncompanies] care about is who someone is, not what they are or where they\u2019ve\nbeen. And once you remove caring about those things, the need for a resume is\nremoved. Let\u2019s face it: Resumes are impossible to devise. They don\u2019t tell the\nstory of who you are. They\u2019re just one piece of the story. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve\ndone and what your credentials are that matter.\n\nWhen using resume data, [hiring companies] just feed bias into the hiring\nprocess. We wanted to get rid of the resume.\n\nDo you think that\u2019s possible? Getting rid of the resume?\n\nYou know, it\u2019s something that the US market, more than any other market in the\nworld, is still very attached to the resume. Whereas elsewhere in the world,\nthey\u2019ve long realized they\u2019re an inferior data point. They risk talent being\nmissed. Particularly in a world where so much of what\u2019s needed is someone\u2019s\nmindset, attitude and power skills. Are they a learner? Are they someone who\ncan cope in a fast-changing environment? Are they curious? Do they work well\nwith people? Are they good thinkers? You can\u2019t tell that in a resume.\n\nHow does this benefit the job-seeker?\n\nPeople forget that moving jobs is potentially a big life change. People have\nchoices too. And we\u2019re committed to transparency. And to do so in a way that\nhelps both the [hiring] organization do better and help the people looking for\na job to do better. How do you help them make better choices? We give everyone\nwho\u2019s interviewed, using this, an insights profile and coaching. This has had\na profound impact. Yes, we\u2019re saving companies lots of money, and we\u2019re\nimproving diversity, but we\u2019re helping elevate the self-awareness of humanity.\nBecause everyone learns from the experience.\n\nMost people don\u2019t know themselves. And they don\u2019t know what jobs they\u2019d be\ngreat for. And they don\u2019t know how to express themselves and communicate that\nto anyone. Helping people with these challenges has actually had the most\npowerful impact on our customers\u2019 brands. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving our next stage\nof innovation: How do we do even more to help people make good choices about\ntheir careers?\n\nHow does this technology impact how many candidates can be hired?\n\nThat\u2019s another thing that\u2019s disruptive about the way we\u2019ve designed this.\nNormally only a handful of people get interviewed. We say, why not interview\nevery single person, because who knows where great talent resides? There are 2\nbillion workers in the world. But we only think about interviewing a handful\nof them. That\u2019s what our technology enables. We sit right at the very\nbeginning of the process. Every single person is interviewed. And they all get\nfeedback. We will finish our interviews within 15 to 20 minutes. Within about\n10 minutes, the interviewee gets a profile that explains what we\u2019ve learned\nabout them. That\u2019s just for their eyes.\n\nHow does this technology impact how organizations access talent?\n\nI recently read that 30% of American kids end up going to college. Whatever\nthat number is, the fact that someone went to college is an immediate\nadvantage. They\u2019re going to get in front of more hiring managers than someone\nwho didn\u2019t.\n\nAnd we all know that getting to college is not about talent. Talent is evenly\ndistributed, but opportunity absolutely isn\u2019t, especially in America. In a\nworld where you\u2019ve got 3.7% unemployment, and that\u2019s not going to get any\nbetter. From a hiring perspective, you must be a company that can reach and\nattract everyone. That includes people who identify with a disability. People\nwho don\u2019t have college. And if you\u2019re relying on resumes, automatically,\nyou\u2019re missing out on a crazy amount of talent.\n\n#### Techstrong TV\n\nClick full-screen to enable volume control\n\nWatch latest episodes and shows\n\n#### Techstrong AI Podcast\n\n#### SHARE THIS STORY\n\n#### RELATED STORIES:\n\nAI-Powered CRISPR Technologies Speed Disease Diagnostics\n\nHireAI Platform Uses Generative AI For Staffing Challenges\n\nLinkedIn Has New AI-Powered Features for Job Seekers\n\nAI\u2019s Role in the Modern Workplace\n\n#### FOLLOW US\n\n#### NEWSLETTER SIGN UP\n\n\u00a9 2024 Techstrong Group, Inc.
