He\nfounded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The\nVerge in 2012.\n\nApr 15, 2024, 1:00 PM UTC\n\n## Share this story\n\nPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nSony is getting ready to release a more powerful PS5 console, possibly by the\nend of this year. After reports of leaked PS5 Pro specifications surfaced\nrecently, The Verge has obtained a full list of specs for the upcoming\nconsole. Sources familiar with Sony\u2019s plans tell me that developers are\nalready being asked to ensure their games are compatible with this upcoming\nconsole, with a focus on improving ray tracing.\n\nCodenamed Trinity, the PlayStation 5 Pro model will include a more powerful\nGPU and a slightly faster CPU mode. All of Sony\u2019s changes point to a PS5 Pro\nthat will be far more capable of rendering games with ray tracing enabled or\nhitting higher resolutions and frame rates in certain titles. Sony appears to\nbe encouraging developers to use graphics features like ray tracing more with\nthe PS5 Pro, with games able to use a \u201cTrinity Enhanced\u201d (PS5 Pro Enhanced)\nlabel if they \u201cprovide significant enhancements.\u201d\n\nSony expects GPU rendering on the PS5 Pro to be \u201cabout 45 percent faster than\nstandard PlayStation 5,\u201d according to documents outlining the upcoming\nconsole. The PS5 Pro GPU will be larger and use faster system memory to help\nimprove ray tracing in games. Sony is also using a \u201cmore powerful ray tracing\narchitecture\u201d in the PS5 Pro, where the speed here is up to three times better\nthan the regular PS5.\n\n\u201cTrinity is a high-end version of PlayStation 5,\u201d reads one document, with\nSony indicating it will continue to sell the standard PS5 after this new model\nlaunches. Sony is expecting game developers to have a single package that will\nsupport both the PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, with existing games able to be\npatched for higher performance.\n\nI understand developers are able to order test kits right now and that Sony is\nexpecting every game submitted to certification in August to be compatible\nwith the PS5 Pro. Insider Gaming first reported the full PS5 Pro specs and\nindicated the console is set to release during the 2024 holiday period.\n\nWhile Sony is improving the GPU side of the PS5 Pro, the CPU will be the same\nas the standard PS5 but with a new mode that clocks it higher. \u201cTrinity has a\nmode that targets 3.85GHz CPU frequency,\u201d says Sony in a document to\ndevelopers. That\u2019s around 10 percent more than the regular PS5. Sony will\noffer developers the ability to pick between a \u201cstandard mode\u201d at 3.5GHz or\nthe \u201chigh CPU frequency mode\u201d at 3.85GHz.\n\nThe standard mode operates just like a regular PS5, where a certain amount of\npower is allocated to the CPU \u2014 it runs at 3.5GHz if the power budget allows\nfor it or lower frequencies if the PS5 is performing \u201cpower-intensive\noperations.\u201d Sony says these lower frequencies are rare and that unused power\non the CPU side is sent to the GPU.\n\nIn this new high CPU frequency mode for the PS5 Pro, more power is allocated\nto the CPU, which means slightly less to the GPU. The GPU is downclocked by\naround 1.5 percent in this mode, which results in \u201croughly 1 percent lower\nperformance,\u201d according to Sony.\n\nThe PS5 Pro will also have some changes to system memory for developers. The\nstandard PS5 memory runs at 448GB/s, but Sony is bumping this up by 28 percent\nto 576GB/s on the PS5 Pro. As the memory system is more efficient on the PS5\nPro, \u201cthe bandwidth gain may exceed 28 percent,\u201d says Sony.\n\nDevelopers will also get more access to overall system memory. Games can use\nan additional 1.2GB of system memory on the PS5 Pro, so that\u2019s 13.7GB overall\ncompared to the 12.5GB allocated to games on the base PS5.\n\nThe increase in memory speed and allocations \u201cmay be useful\u201d for Sony\u2019s new\nPlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) support. This is essentially\nSony\u2019s upscaling answer to Nvidia\u2019s DLSS or AMD\u2019s FSR to improve frame rates\nand image quality on PlayStation. Sony has built a \u201ccustom architecture for\nmachine learning\u201d on the PS5 Pro, which supports 300TOPS of 8-bit computation.\n\nThis new architecture supports Sony\u2019s custom PSSR upscaling solution, which is\ndesigned to replace a game\u2019s existing temporal anti-aliasing or upsampling\nimplementation. Sony notes that \u201cinputs are quite similar to DLSS or FSR\u201d and\nthat full HDR support is included. This support requires around 250MB of\nmemory, which is why the memory allocations on the PS5 Pro should help here.\nSony says there is around 2ms of latency involved in upscaling a 1080p image\nto 4K and that the company is working to support resolutions up to 8K and even\nimprove the latency in the future.\n\nIf developers are able to get their games ready in time, I fully expect to see\na PS5 Pro launch this holiday season. Sony appears to be following the same\nplaybook as the PS4, with a \u201cSlim\u201d PS5 model and then a Pro edition. I\u2019m\nexpecting to see an \u201cenhanced\u201d library of existing games for the PS5 Pro\nlaunch and new first-party games arriving over time with improved ray-tracing\nsupport for this new console.\n\nFeatured Videos From The Verge\n\n## Lenovo made a rolling laptop\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nLenovo is at MWC 2023 to make a pitch for a rollable future.
