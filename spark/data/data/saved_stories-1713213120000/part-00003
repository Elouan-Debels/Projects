At its core, the Bill\nrequires those responsible for training or modifying a dataset, used to build\na generative AI system, to notify the Copyright Office of any copyrighted\nworks used in that process. In summary, AI must achieve the impossible, to\nbenefit the few, or completely disconnect from the internet.\n\nIn his 1962 book, Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the\nPossible, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke noted that \u201cany sufficiently\nadvanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u201d\n\nAt the dawn of the 80s, when computers thrived on a single kilobyte of RAM,\nany enthusiast with access to Clarke\u2019s book would\u2019ve read his words, gazed at\nthe 1,024 bytes of available RAM, and envisioned a galaxy of opportunity. As\nexpectations have grown year-on-year, mainstream users of technology today are\nmuch less easily impressed, and fewer still experience magic.\n\nYet, there are solid grounds for even the most experienced technologists to\nreevaluate almost everything based on current AI innovation. Released on\nWednesday, the astonishing Udio produces music from written prompts and\nseamlessly integrates user-supplied lyrics, regardless of how personal,\nfrivolous, or unsuitable for work they are.\n\n> I found an account on Udio that is mostly generating songs about how his\n> friend Seth shit his pants at work pic.twitter.com/v3jJByMbtq\n>\n> \u2014 abcdent (@abcdentminded) April 11, 2024\n\nUdio and other platforms dedicated to generative AI are the kind of magic that\ncan\u2019t be undermined by looking up a sleeve or spotting a twin in the audience.\nIndeed, the complexities under the hood that generate the magic are\nimpenetrable for the layman.\n\nOne thing is certain, however; Udio didn\u2019t simply boot itself up one day and\nsay, \u201cI know Kung Fu (Fighting by Carl Douglas).\u201d It was continuously fed\nexisting content from unspecified sources before singing (or rapping) a single\nnote. If a new bill introduced at the U.S. House of Representatives gains\ntraction, Udio\u2019s makers will have to declare every single song Udio was\ntrained on, retrospectively.\n\n## The Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act\n\nIntroduced by Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA) this week, the bill envisions\n\u201cgroundbreaking legislation\u201d that would compel companies to be completely\ntransparent when training their generative AI models on copyrighted content.\nFrom Sciff\u2019s website:\n\nThe Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act would require a notice to be\nsubmitted to the Register of Copyrights prior to the release of a new\ngenerative AI system with regard to all copyrighted works used in building or\naltering the training dataset for that system. The bill\u2019s requirements would\nalso apply retroactively to previously released generative AI systems.\n\n\u201cAI has the disruptive potential of changing our economy, our political\nsystem, and our day-to-day lives. We must balance the immense potential of AI\nwith the crucial need for ethical guidelines and protections,\u201d Rep. Schiff\nexplains.\n\n\u201cMy Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act is a pivotal step in this\ndirection. It champions innovation while safeguarding the rights and\ncontributions of creators, ensuring they are aware when their work contributes\nto AI training datasets. This is about respecting creativity in the age of AI\nand marrying technological progress with fairness.\u201d\n\nThe bill has huge support; the RIAA says that \u201ccomprehensive and transparent\nrecordkeeping\u201d are the \u201cfundamental building blocks\u201d of effective enforcement\nof creators\u2019 rights, a stance echoed by ASCAP and, in broad terms, all groups\nlisted at the end of this article.\n\nSince the Directors Guild of America says it \u201ccommends this commonsense\nlegislation,\u201d a common sense perspective on the proposals shall be applied\nhere.\n\n## Artists & Creators Deserve to Get Paid. Period\n\nThere can be no debate: the removal of existing art from the generative AI\nequation is impossible. The latter simply cannot exist without the former; the\nbig legal debate seems to hang on whether consumption was protected under the\ndoctrine of fair use, or was straightforward copyright infringement.\n\nIf the court finds in favor of fair use, it seems likely that no copyright\nholders will receive compensation. A finding in the other direction is likely\nto lead to copyright holders getting paid in some way, shape, or form.\n\nYet while the architects of the Bill claim that it \u201cchampions innovation while\nsafeguarding the rights and contributions of creators,\u201d the only realistic\nbeneficiaries longer-term will be copyright holders with a significant enough\nprofile to be identified for subsequent reporting.\n\nIn most developed countries, copyrights automatically apply as soon as\ncreative works are created. This means there could easily be a billion\ncreators with valid, albeit unregistered copyrights, in tens of billions of\nimages, photos, videos, and music tracks, available online today.\n\nThe Bill claims to act on behalf of creators but in reality can only ever\nbenefit an identifiable subset, with registered copyrights, for the purposes\nof \u201ceffective enforcement of creators\u2019 rights,\u201d according to the RIAA.\n\n## Join The Big Team or Get Nothing\n\nMuch like the proposal to \u201cblow up the internet\u201d in the movie Four Lions, the\nBill hasn\u2019t even considered what can and can\u2019t be achieved. A centralized\ndatabase, of all copyrighted works and their respective owners, doesn\u2019t exist.\nEven if an AI development team wanted to report that a certain copyright work\nhad been used, how can ownership of that content ever be established?\n\nAnd then at some point, almost inevitably, content created with elements of\nother content, permissible under the doctrine of fair use, will be reported as\noriginal copyrighted content, when no payment for that use is required under\nlaw.\n\nThis leads to a number of conclusions, all based on how rights are currently\nmanaged. At least initially, if compelled to identify all copyright works used\nto the Copyright Office, that will only be useful to the subset of creators\nmentioned earlier.\n\nIn the long-term, smaller creators \u2013 who feel that they too deserve to get\npaid \u2013 will probably have to join the future equivalent of a Content ID\nprogram for AI. Run by those with the power to put such a system in place,\nthese entities have a reputation of making the rules and keeping most of the\nmoney.\n\nThe bottom line is extremely straightforward: if creators should be rewarded\nfor their work, then all creators should be rewarded for their work. There\ncannot be discriminatory rules that value one copyright holder\u2019s rights over\nthose of another. More fundamentally, don\u2019t propose legislation without\nconsidering the burden of future compliance, and then double up with\nexponential difficulties associated with retroactive compliance, as the Bill\nlays out.\n\n## It\u2019s a Kind of Magic, But Not Actually Magic\n\nAI may achieve magical things, but it is not actually magic. The Bill requires\nAI companies, entities, to provide a \u201csufficiently detailed summary of any\ncopyrighted works used in the training dataset\u201d to the Register of Copyrights,\nnot later than 30 days before the generative AI system is made available to\nthe public. Or, read differently, enough time to prevent release with an\ninjunction.\n\nOn the basis that this task simply cannot be achieved for all copyright\nholders, right across the board, the proposal fails. A ChatGPT instance didn\u2019t\nreject the Bill or its proposals outright when given the details by us today.\nHowever, considering its dataset, and allowing a handling time of one second\nfor each copyright work to be identified in theory, could take over 31 years\nto complete.\n\n\u201cThis crazy number highlights the immense scale and complexity of the task. It\nemphasizes the need for innovative solutions, automation, and cooperation\namong stakeholders to navigate the challenges of copyright in the AI era,\u201d one\nof the reasons for the debate concludes.\n\nThe Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act can be found here (pdf)\n\nThe Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act is supported by the Recording\nIndustry Association of America, Copyright Clearance Center, Directors Guild\nof America, Authors Guild, National Association of Voice Actors, Concept Art\nAssociation, Professional Photographers of America, Screen Actors Guild-\nAmerican Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Writers Guild of America\nWest, Writers Guild of America East, American Society of Composers, Authors\nand Publishers, American Society for Collective Rights Licensing,\nInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Society of Composers and\nLyricists, National Music Publishers Association, Recording Academy, Nashville\nSongwriters Association International, Songwriters of North America, Black\nMusic Action Coalition, Music Artist Coalition, Human Artistry Campaign, and\nthe American Association of Independent Music.\n\nImage Credit\n\n  * Next Post\n  * Previous Post\n\n### Tagged In:\n\n  * artificial intelligence\n  * copyright\n  * generative ai\n  * Generative AI Copyright Disclosure Act\n\n### You Might Also Like:\n\n### AI-Startup Launches Ever-Expanding Library of Free Stock Photos and Music\n\n  * yesterday, 11:42 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\n### \u2018The New York Times Needs More than \u2018Imagined Fears\u2019 to Block AI\nInnovation\u2019\n\n  * March 29, 2024, 23:52 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\n### Authors Sue NVIDIA for Training AI on Pirated Books\n\n  * March 11, 2024, 14:17 by Ernesto Van der Sar\n\nSubmit a correction or tip.\n\n##### Sponsors\n\n##### Popular Posts\n\n  * #### Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously?\n\n  * #### Iconic Torrent Site RARBG Shuts Down, All Content Releases Stop\n\n  * #### \u2018U.S. Authorities Seize Z-Library Domain Names\u2019\n\n  * #### House of The Dragon Season Finale Leaks Early on Pirate Sites\n\n  * #### US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites\n\n##### From 2 Years ago...\n\nKodi Addon & Build Repositories Shut Down Citing Legal Pressure (Updated)\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nMajor Record Labels Sue Youtube-dl\u2019s Hosting Provider\n\nKodi Addon & Build Repositories Shut Down Citing Legal Pressure (Updated)\n\nMorgan Freeman: Movie Pirates Have Tiny, Useless Penises\n\n#### TorrentFreak Stats\n\n  * ### 14948\n\nBreaking news stories\n\n  * ### 179k\n\nSocial media followers\n\n  * ### 19.9k\n\nRSS subscribers\n\nCopyright \u00b7 Privacy Policy \u00b7 VPN Providers \u00b7 About TorrentFreak\n\n", "frontpage": false}
