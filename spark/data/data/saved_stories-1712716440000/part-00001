Microsoft today released updates to address 147\nsecurity holes in Windows, Office, Azure, .NET Framework, Visual Studio, SQL\nServer, DNS Server, Windows Defender, Bitlocker, and Windows Secure Boot.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest release from Microsoft this year and the largest since at\nleast 2017,\u201d said Dustin Childs, from Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).\n\u201cAs far as I can tell, it\u2019s the largest Patch Tuesday release from Microsoft\nof all time.\u201d\n\nOnce again this month, there are no known zero-day vulnerabilities threatening\nWindows users. Tempering the sheer volume of this month\u2019s patches is the\nmiddling severity of many of the bugs. Only three of April\u2019s vulnerabilities\nearned Microsoft\u2019s most-dire \u201ccritical\u201d rating, meaning they can be abused by\nmalware or malcontents to take remote control over unpatched systems with no\nhelp from users.\n\nMost of the flaws that Microsoft deems \u201cmore likely to be exploited\u201d this\nmonth are marked as \u201cimportant,\u201d which usually involve bugs that require a bit\nmore user interaction (social engineering) but which nevertheless can result\nin system security bypass, compromise, and the theft of critical assets.\n\nBen McCarthy, lead cyber security engineer at Immersive Labs called attention\nto CVE-2024-20670, an Outlook for Windows spoofing vulnerability described as\nbeing easy to exploit. It involves convincing a user to click on a malicious\nlink in an email, which can then steal the user\u2019s password hash and\nauthenticate as the user in another Microsoft service.\n\nAnother interesting bug McCarthy pointed to is CVE-2024-29063, which involves\nhard-coded credentials in Azure\u2019s search backend infrastructure that could be\ngleaned by taking advantage of Azure AI search.\n\n\u201cThis along with many other AI attacks in recent news shows a potential new\nattack surface that we are just learning how to mitigate against,\u201d McCarthy\nsaid. \u201cMicrosoft has updated their backend and notified any customers who have\nbeen affected by the credential leakage.\u201d\n\nCVE-2024-29988 is a weakness that allows attackers to bypass Windows\nSmartScreen, a technology Microsoft designed to provide additional protections\nfor end users against phishing and malware attacks. Childs said one ZDI\u2019s\nresearchers found this vulnerability being exploited in the wild, although\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t currently list CVE-2024-29988 as being exploited.\n\n\u201cI would treat this as in the wild until Microsoft clarifies,\u201d Childs said.\n\u201cThe bug itself acts much like CVE-2024-21412 \u2013 a [zero-day threat from\nFebruary] that bypassed the Mark of the Web feature and allows malware to\nexecute on a target system. Threat actors are sending exploits in a zipped\nfile to evade EDR/NDR detection and then using this bug (and others) to bypass\nMark of the Web.\u201d\n\nSatnam Narang at Tenable notes that this month\u2019s release includes fixes for\ntwo dozen flaws in Windows Secure Boot, the majority of which are considered\n\u201cExploitation Less Likely\u201d according to Microsoft.\n\n\u201cHowever, the last time Microsoft patched a flaw in Windows Secure Boot in May\n2023 had a notable impact as it was exploited in the wild and linked to the\nBlackLotus UEFI bootkit, which was sold on dark web forums for $5,000,\u201d Narang\nsaid. \u201cBlackLotus can bypass functionality called secure boot, which is\ndesigned to block malware from being able to load when booting up. While none\nof these Secure Boot vulnerabilities addressed this month were exploited in\nthe wild, they serve as a reminder that flaws in Secure Boot persist, and we\ncould see more malicious activity related to Secure Boot in the future.\u201d\n\nFor links to individual security advisories indexed by severity, check out\nZDI\u2019s blog and the Patch Tuesday post from the SANS Internet Storm Center.\nPlease consider backing up your data or your drive before updating, and drop a\nnote in the comments here if you experience any issues applying these fixes.\n\nAdobe today released nine patches tackling at least two dozen vulnerabilities\nin a range of software products, including Adobe After Effects, Photoshop,\nCommerce, InDesign, Experience Manager, Media Encoder, Bridge, Illustrator,\nand Adobe Animate.\n\nKrebsOnSecurity needs to correct the record on a point mentioned at the end of\nMarch\u2019s \u201cFat Patch Tuesday\u201d post, which looked at new AI capabilities built\ninto Adobe Acrobat that are turned on by default. Adobe has since clarified\nthat its apps won\u2019t use AI to auto-scan your documents, as the original\nlanguage in its FAQ suggested.\n\n\u201cIn practice, no document scanning or analysis occurs unless a user actively\nengages with the AI features by agreeing to the terms, opening a document, and\nselecting the AI Assistant or generative summary buttons for that specific\ndocument,\u201d Adobe said earlier this month.\n\nThis entry was posted on Tuesday 9th of April 2024 04:28 PM\n\nTime to Patch\n\n.NET Framework Adobe After Effects Azure Azure AI Ben McCarthy Bitlocker\nBridge Commerce CVE-2023-24932 CVE-2024-20670 CVE-2024-21412 CVE-2024-29063\nCVE-2024-29988 DNS Server Experience Manager Illustrator Immersive Labs\nInDesign Media Encoder Office photoshop Satnam Narang SQL Server Trend Micro's\nZero Day Initiative Visual Studio Windows Defender Windows Secure Boot\n\n## One thought on \u201cApril\u2019s Patch Tuesday Brings Record Number of Fixes\u201d\n\n  1. roger tubby April 9, 2024\n\nIs it just me (a single developer trying to stay on top of these), but the\nMicrosoft Vulnerabilities web page is missing a critical sorting/filtering\nelement: which component of their software is affected?\n\nI think I\u2019ve seen that before and definitely see it in the CISA pages. Why\nwouldn\u2019t we be able to look for software that we have installed in order to\nfix those with the highest vulnerability/impact/in-use numbers?\n\nReply \u2192\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMailing List\n\nSubscribe here\n\nSearch KrebsOnSecurity\n\nRecent Posts\n\n  * April\u2019s Patch Tuesday Brings Record Number of Fixes\n  * Fake Lawsuit Threat Exposes Privnote Phishing Sites\n  * \u2018The Manipulaters\u2019 Improve Phishing, Still Fail at Opsec\n  * Thread Hijacking: Phishes That Prey on Your Curiosity\n  * Recent \u2018MFA Bombing\u2019 Attacks Targeting Apple Users\n\nStory Categories\n\n  * A Little Sunshine\n  * All About Skimmers\n  * Ashley Madison breach\n  * Breadcrumbs\n  * Data Breaches\n  * DDoS-for-Hire\n  * Employment Fraud\n  * How to Break Into Security\n  * Internet of Things (IoT)\n  * Latest Warnings\n  * Ne'er-Do-Well News\n  * Other\n  * Pharma Wars\n  * Ransomware\n  * Russia's War on Ukraine\n  * Security Tools\n  * SIM Swapping\n  * Spam Nation\n  * Target: Small Businesses\n  * Tax Refund Fraud\n  * The Coming Storm\n  * Time to Patch\n  * Web Fraud 2.0\n\nWhy So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia\n\n\u00a9 Krebs on Security - Mastodon\n\n", "frontpage": false}
