(No Game Engine)\n\n3.4KLikes\n\n70,445Views\n\nMar 172024\n\nLeaving all the other contenders - Unreal, Unity, Godot, GameMaker and many\nmore - in the dust, I bring forth the strongest game development toolkit known\nto man - SQL. Taking advantage of all the features this tool offers, I\ndeveloped a fully functional Snake Game implementation, which runs on a remote\ndatabase, to which anyone can connect, play (or watch), and marvel at the\nfuture of video games and their development. Making use of PostgreSQL and a\ncouple of really interesting options it has to offer, along with some of my\nbeloved Python, I managed to create a fully interchangeble/interoperational\narchitecture, to make this as customizable and modular as possible.
