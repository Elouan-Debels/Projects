Emerging with monopoly capitalism in the late\nnineteenth century, the class came into its own by the mid-twentieth century\nand formed a core of the New Left. In their essay, \u201cclass\u201d is both \u201ca common\nrelation to the economic foundations of society\u201d and \u201cactual relations between\ngroups of people, not formal relations between people and objects.\u201d In other\nwords, the authors felt that their erstwhile New Left comrades related to the\nworking class in a distinct way, not simply as fellow workers.\n\nWhen the social worker confronts her client, or the manager his worker, they\ndo so in an \u201cobjectively antagonistic\u201d relationship. The PMC are \u201csalaried\nmental workers who do not own the means of production and whose major function\nin the social division of labor may be described broadly as the reproduction\nof capitalist culture and capitalist class relations.\u201d\n\nThese contradictory interests are a product not only of social location but of\nsocial function. A mediating class, the PMC only exists \u201cby virtue of the\nexpropriation of the skills and culture once indigenous to the working\nclass\u201d\u2014cultural production, social reproduction, and so on. They relate to the\nworking class with a mixture of \u201ccontempt and paternalism,\u201d while workers\ninteract with them with \u201chostility and deference.\u201d As such, even as the\nworking conditions and pay of members of the PMC deteriorate, it\u2019s not a\ncertainty that they will line up on the side of the working class, much less\nthat such a coalition would be without tension.\n\nSuch was the thesis set out by the Ehrenreichs in 1977. Given the term\u2019s\nnewfound currency, and the inconsistency with which it is thrown around, I\ncalled up Barbara Ehrenreich last week to speak with her about the PMC\u2019s past\nand present and the context in which she and John Ehrenreich coined the term.\nThe conversation has been edited for clarity and concision.\n\nAlex Press: You coined the term \u201cPMC\u201d in a pair of essays from 1977 in Radical\nAmerica whose motivation was a desire to analyze the New Left\u2019s trajectory.\nCould you lay out in your own terms how you define the professional-managerial\nclass, and what the context was for the concept?\n\nBarbara Ehrenreich: We wrote that essay in a rather tedious way to try to not\noffend the Marxists\u2014and we would\u2019ve included ourselves in that category. But\nit was very much growing out of what we were experiencing politically on the\nleft. John Ehrenreich and I had a New American Movement (NAM) chapter that\noften met in our house, and it was interesting in that it had such a mix of\npeople by class\u2014not, unfortunately, by race, but by class. There was a clump\nof people who were warehouse workers, who were involved in an organizing\ndrive, and then, at the other extreme, there was a full professor and his\nwife. So it was fascinating and also terrifying to watch the interactions.\n\nI think I in particular was very sensitive to these things because of my own\nbackground. My father had originally been a copper miner, and the other men in\nthe family were railroad workers and other miners. But I had gone to college\nand gotten a PhD, so I was also a card-carrying member of the PMC. I could see\nthe tensions rising. The professor and his wife, who became very dominant in\nthe group, had a lot of contempt for the more working-class people. It was\ncringeworthy. To me it was important that people get along. We wanted a\nmovement that would include the college teachers and the warehouse workers.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out. The professor and his wife walked out. First, they\ndenounced me personally\u2014they brought a copy of Mao\u2019s Little Red Book, which\nthey read aloud from, only whenever Mao was denouncing liberals, they would\nsay \u201cBarbara.\u201d It was just bizarre, and it was painful at the same time. This\nclimactic meeting took place in the home of two of our working-class members:\nhe was a locksmith, and she was a nurse\u2019s aide. They had treats set out for\npeople to nibble on, cookies and cakes, because that\u2019s what you do when you\nhave people to your house\u2014and the professor and his wife just ignored it. And\nthat\u2019s not how you act when you\u2019re in somebody\u2019s house. It was awful.\n\nI saw similar things going on in other parts of the country. For example,\nthere were fights that would break out in food co-ops\u2014they were called the\n\u201cTwinkie wars.\u201d People wanted the food co-op to carry the highly processed,\nno-doubt-bad-for-you foods that they could get in the supermarket, and the\nmore PMC types did not want that.\n\nSo, there was a lot of empirical data that went into this essay. There was a\nreal difference between people who worked essentially telling other people\nwhat to do\u2014and teachers get included in that\u2014and people who do the work that\nother people tell them to do. It becomes a difference between manual and\nmental labor, but it carries with it a shitload of weight\u2014I see it all the\ntime, the contempt for especially white working-class people among leftists of\ncollege backgrounds.\n\nThe general response to that essay was very negative coming from within NAM.\nFor example, I remember a NAM member\u2014who went on to become quite a prominent\ncentrist pundit\u2014whispering to me in a NAM national meeting that I had done\nmore than anybody to destroy the possibility of revolutionary socialism in\nthis country. Kind of shocking; a big burden to bear for the rest of your\nlife.\n\nPress: What provoked that level of backlash?\n\nEhrenreich: It seemed like our whole sense of integrity as people on the left\nrested on our also being working class. We had to be in the same relationship\nto capital as, say, blue-collar workers, and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\nWe were saying: let\u2019s be upfront about this division.\n\nPress: In your 2013 reflection on the PMC, you write, \u201cThe center has not\nheld. Conceived as \u2018the middle class\u2019 and as the supposed repository of civic\nvirtue and occupational dedication, the PMC lies in ruins.\u201d You add that \u201cthe\nPMC\u2019s original dream\u2014of a society ruled by reason and led by public-spirited\nprofessionals\u2014has been discredited.\u201d What happened to the PMC?\n\nEhrenreich: I do think it\u2019s been seriously smashed. In that article we wrote\nfor the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung, John and I talk about professions as basic\nand seemingly eternal as law, for example. That\u2019s been undermined: law schools\nfake the number of their graduates who end up with jobs that are even related\nto the law. You of course know what\u2019s happened to journalists; we don\u2019t get\npaid. College teaching [has been] totally undermined by essentially minimum-\nwage adjuncts. So I would say that what happened to the blue-collar working\nclass with deindustrialization is now happening with the PMC\u2014except for the\ntop managerial end of it, which continues to do very well and perhaps amounts\nto about 20 percent of the population.\n\nPress: In that 2013 essay, after characterizing the PMC as \u201cin ruins,\u201d you\nask, \u201cShould we mourn the fate of the PMC or rejoice that there is one less\nsmug, self-styled, elite to stand in the way of a more egalitarian future?\u201d\nWhere do you fall in answering that question now?\n\nEhrenreich: That\u2019s a hard one. We have to appreciate what has always been the\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre of the PMC. There is a service ethic, which can still be found\namong many professionals. There are also the usual number of corporate lackeys\nwho will do anything they\u2019re asked to, but the service ethic is something that\nis not appreciated enough.\n\nNor do professionals themselves appreciate how much this sense they are doing\nsomething worthwhile is also a part of the consciousness of blue-collar\nworkers. I have a truck driver friend who likes to point out that every single\nthing I get in the supermarket was delivered there by truck. Nothing works\nwithout people like him. And although it\u2019s getting harder and harder to take\npride in jobs like that, as they\u2019re more minutely monitored or surveilled, we\nshould be able to build on that and connect broadly through that sense of\npride and craft.\n\nI\u2019m surprised and taken aback by what I got from [Gabriel Winant\u2019s] article. I\ngot the sense within DSA, for example, \u201cPMC\u201d has become a slur of sorts?\n\nPress: In parts of left media, including Jacobin\u2014where I work\u2014I think the term\nhas become a shorthand to point out that the interests of, say, pundits, or\nwealthier Democratic primary voters, aren\u2019t identical to those of working-\nclass people. So it\u2019s gained some currency in light of the 2020 presidential\nelection in particular. But your 1977 essays also have some bearing on\nanalyzing DSA\u2019s composition\u2014there\u2019s something similar happening now that is\nnot unlike how you looked at the New Left\u2019s composition in the original essay.\n\nEhrenreich: It\u2019s interesting, but I hate to see \u201cPMC\u201d turned into an ultraleft\nslur. We\u2019re going to have to work together! You\u2019re probably college-educated\nyourself.\n\nPress: So what would you say to anyone who thinks members of the PMC are more\nor less irrelevant for the left, either because they\u2019re strategically useless\ncompared to the power of, say, the industrial working class to disrupt\ncapital, or because they\u2019re irredeemable, condemned always to serve as an\nadjunct to capital?\n\nEhrenreich: Well, [\u201cPMC\u201d as a term] is becoming less important as this\npolarization goes on within the professions, such as college teaching. The few\npeople who are at the top are not going to very readily take up the fights of\nadjuncts, much less of the sanitation workers on campus. When my book Nickel\nand Dimed came out, I was traveling around the country and speaking on college\ncampuses and trying to tell students that their education is being provided\nnot just by administrators and professors, but by everyone else including the\npeople who clean the classrooms at night. And that they had to look around and\nmake common cause with the people on campus who were being ground down by low\nwages.\n\nPress: There are interesting examples of just that sort of coalition today.\nTech workers\u2014highly paid engineers\u2014organizing alongside third-party, low-wage\ncontractors at their companies, like janitorial or cafeteria staff. Or take\nthe teachers\u2019 strikes: in Chicago right now, the teachers are out alongside\nthe SEIU Local 73 service workers.\n\nEhrenreich: Well, that\u2019s thrilling. I\u2019m very glad to hear it. Sometimes, like\nin healthcare, it\u2019s very hard to get nurses to form alliances with the\ntechnicians and even the lower-level nursing staff. And that\u2019s because nurses\nhave such a fragile grip on professionalism themselves. They\u2019re still not\ntaken seriously by doctors and administrators. I can understand it, but these\nare the things organizers have to work on step by step.\n\nPress: When you wrote the original PMC essay, there was an emerging analysis\non the right, among neoconservatives, about the so-called \u201cNew Class.\u201d Today,\nthere\u2019s an equivalent of sorts, a right-wing populism that draws on the likes\nof James Burnham and will even at times criticize global capitalism in favor\nof an emphasis on the nation-state, and on white Americans in particular. But\nit\u2019s done in a classic bait-and-switch fashion, offering traditionally\nreactionary economic policies.\n\nI\u2019m thinking of Richard Spencer, Tucker Carlson, and Josh Hawley\u2014the\nRepublican Senator from Missouri. They all come from a PMC background\nthemselves. What do you make of this milieu?\n\nEhrenreich: It\u2019s a painful subject. I\u2019ve always wanted a left-wing populism\nthat could reach out to the same sorts of people [the right-wing populists are\ntargeting]. Their hypocrisy, of course, knows no bounds: if you or I were to\nsuddenly get a lot of media attention for our denunciations of capitalism,\nthey would be all over us for our privileged lives, I guarantee, no matter how\nunprivileged you may feel. You know, \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you taking in a bunch of\nasylum seekers in your apartment?\u201d and so on. They insist on some kind of\nextreme altruism on the far left but see no contradiction between what they\u2019re\ndoing and the effects on working-class people of what they\u2019re saying\u2014they\ndon\u2019t see that it applies to them.\n\nIn 2016, I suddenly became very popular with the media. I started getting all\nthese calls to explain \u201cWhat is this white working class? Do I know any of\nthem?\u201d The extreme gap between our media and the working class seems to me at\ntimes unbridgeable. In the nineties, I was working with an editor at a liberal\nwomen\u2019s magazine. I\u2019d wanted to write something about \u201cwhy not marry blue-\ncollar men?\u201d instead of all the \u201csearching for someone who\u2019s richer, taller\u201d\npieces. The editor listened to this pitch and then said\u2014referencing the blue-\ncollar man\u2014\u201cbut can they talk?\u201d I was aghast. I was in fact actually married\nto [a blue-collar man] at the time\u2014after my marriage to John, I ended up with\none of those warehouse workers I mentioned who was in NAM. And he was and is\nan intellectual; he\u2019s read far more Marx than I have.\n\nPress: How do we recognize the similarities between people of different class\npositions without papering over or flattening the differences?\n\nEhrenreich: It deserves very serious discussion. For example, we should ask:\nwhat bad habits do we bring to a mixed-class situation, and what good habits?\nWe must think this through a lot more. I\u2019m very worried now thinking of\nsomething like DSA, that the working-class impression will be that we\u2019re a\nbunch of scolds, telling people that they\u2019re racist, that they\u2019re homophobic.\nAnd sometimes, before you\u2019ve even got a word out of your mouth, some people\nare cringing because they think that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to say to them. We\ncan\u2019t organize like that. But I don\u2019t know these answers.\n\nPress: What\u2019s the PMC\u2019s relationship to the Democratic Party?\n\nEhrenreich: The Democratic Party really let down the American working class in\nthe nineties and thereafter: Clinton, Obama. People are right to be skeptical,\nthough the forms that skepticism takes are all too often racist. It was so\nclear when Hillary Clinton was running, because she exemplifies PMC values\u2014the\ntechnocratic aspect anyway: get a bunch of experts from Harvard and MIT in the\nsame room and we\u2019ll figure out a solution. And Obama did the same kind of\nthing: when he came into office, he called in televised, high-level meetings\non the economy, and all the people around the table were businessmen.\n\nPress: What do you make of the momentum that emerged around the Bernie Sanders\ncampaign in 2016?\n\nEhrenreich: It\u2019s wonderful. I supported Sanders four years ago. This time I\ndon\u2019t want to get into it\u2014I got very mad a few months ago at the lefties on\nsocial media attacking each other. I worry when the left puts too much\nemphasis on electoral politics, especially national electoral politics. That\ngoes back to my days in DSA and the fights that would ensue over whether DSA\nshould endorse this candidate or that candidate for president. Come on, it\ndoesn\u2019t really matter. The one time it mattered to me was when Jesse Jackson\nwas running. Mike Harrington and his folks were against endorsing Jackson. It\nwasn\u2019t like endorsing would make a big difference to Jackson or anyone else,\nbut I thought it\u2019d be a nice gesture: you have somebody you agree with, you\nshould back them up.\n\nBut mostly, I think that it\u2019s foolish to think the endorsement of an\norganization with 60,000 members is going to affect major elections.\n\nPress: You mention DSA. So, NAM, which you were a part of, folds, and you\u2019re\npart of creating DSA. Can you talk about those years?\n\nEhrenreich: With a certain amount of ambivalence and regret.\n\nI opposed the merger of NAM and DSOC [the Democratic Socialist Organizing\nCommittee]. That\u2019s how NAM disappeared; it merged with DSOC to make DSA. I\nopposed the merger for political reasons. I knew Mike Harrington basically\nfrom debating him in public on all sorts of issues. It\u2019s embarrassing, because\nnow when I look back, I ask: why did I accept the co-chair position [of DSA]?\nAnd all I can say is, well, vanity! Vanity was some part of it. And the\nthought that I could have an influence. I didn\u2019t realize what I was up\nagainst.\n\nPress: What do you mean by that? How were the years of co-chairing DSA and\nworking with Harrington?\n\nEhrenreich: Well, this could be a whole essay\u2014something I write just before I\ndie. It wasn\u2019t easy. There were great people in DSA at this point: Cornel West\nand Frances Fox Piven were friends of mine. But there was also this core that\nhad come from the DSOC strain of thought\u2014it was very strongly anti-communist\nsocialism\u2014and we weren\u2019t shaped by that very much. Being anti-Soviet did not\nmean that we were obsessed with being anti-communist at all.\n\nPress: During that period, the power of the socialist left is in decline, and\nso is that of organized labor. What was the left\u2019s relationship to the unions?\n\nEhrenreich: NAM didn\u2019t have any formal relation to unions. I mean, a lot of\nour members were union members or even organizers, or organizers of dissident\nmovements within unions, so there was certainly a connection, but it was not\nlike the connection that DSOC had. Mike cultivated personal relationships with\na number of labor leaders\u2014some of whom were great, like [William] Winpisinger\nfrom the machinists\u2019 union. There were very good people among them, but it\nalso meant that DSOC had to stay within the parameters set by union leaders,\nwhich meant a preoccupation with the old working class that was being\ndestroyed at the time. There was a new working class coming up that was more\nwomen, more people of color, yet DSOC\u2019s politics were still stuck with the old\nleadership.\n\nI didn\u2019t understand why we had to be so damn deferential to union leaders.\n\nPress: Compared to, say, rank-and-file workers?\n\nEhrenreich: Exactly. And to provide solidarity when there were strikes and so\non. But I just couldn\u2019t see taking political leadership from these guys.\n\nPress: What is the difference in what you wanted and what those guys wanted?\n\nEhrenreich: When you\u2019re talking about union leaders, you\u2019re talking about\npeople who at that time ran very big organizations involving a lot of money.\nIt\u2019s a cultural thing, in part\u2014I came out of the New Left of the sixties. We\nwere pro-union, but saw unions as quite limited in their aspirations.\n\nAfter I wrote Nickel and Dimed, I was invited to speak to AFL-CIO leadership.\nIt was a full room, maybe fifty people, in their big palace in Washington,\nD.C. And I was talking about the complete lack of rights workers have at work:\nspeech, assembly, privacy\u2014they have nothing. And the response was \u201cWell, when\nthey join unions they\u2019ll have all those rights.\u201d Bullshit! That\u2019s not\nsomething unions have put forward. Unions didn\u2019t fight, for example, pre-\nemployment drug-testing\u2014which I think is now becoming recognized as a major\nprivacy issue. They were not interested in democratizing the workplace.\n\nSo there\u2019s a huge chasm really between my kind of politics and the kind I\nfound in the DSOC part of DSA. They quickly abolished the position of co-\nchairs [after Michael Harrington\u2019s death] because they\u2019d be left with, well,\nme. I don\u2019t want to be a buzzkill for DSA here, but people should know it was\nalways fractious.\n\nPress: Some of the tension you lived through is being reproduced now. There\u2019s\na questioning of how white-collar workers build a coalition with working-class\npeople, and the question of how these workers\u2019 identities factor in comes up a\nlot; it can complicate things. Surely part of the reason you were originally\ngrappling with the concept of the PMC was because of the problem of this\ninwardness, or individualism, that professional-class people were hung up on.\nAfter all, it\u2019s the nature of the PMC that it will be constantly articulating\nitself, reflecting on itself, and so on\u2014that\u2019s their job. But it can get in\nthe way of building power.\n\nEhrenreich: Or making any kind of human connection to other people. I\u2019ll give\nyou another anecdote\u2014though this is not about DSA. In 2009, there was an\nevent\u2014part of an international series of socialist gatherings\u2014in Detroit.\nThere was a workshop at this conference, and I had invited a group of working-\nclass people from Fort Wayne, Indiana, who I had become close to. About six or\nseven of them drove from Fort Wayne to Detroit, and they were mostly laid-off\nfoundry workers: stereotypical white men\u2014though, actually, not all of them\nwere white. I was closest with one of them, Tom Lewandowski, who created a\nworkers\u2019 organization and was the head of the Central Labor Council in the\nFort Wayne area. [At the event], they talked about what they were facing in\nthe recession. And then some woman in the room who was an adjunct professor\nsuddenly says, \u201cI\u2019m tired of listening to white men talk.\u201d\n\nI was so aghast. Of course, it was a big setback for my friends from Fort\nWayne, who were humiliated. I advised Tom not to get into settings where he\nwould be subjected to that ever again. There has to be a way to say to such\npeople, look, we know you probably aren\u2019t doing great as an adjunct, but have\nsome respect for other people\u2019s work and their experience, and recognize that\nthey are different from you in some way. I\u2019ve just had too many encounters\nlike that, which are kind of heartbreaking.\n\nDo you see that kind of thing?\n\nPress: I do, yes. I think that\u2019s related to what I meant by a particularly\nindividualistic understanding of identity\u2014which seems like an obstacle.\n\nEhrenreich: Right, yeah. Why can\u2019t we do a better job of making this argument?\nEvery time I question identity politics, some feminist friend of mine is going\nto jump on me.\n\nPress: I do think it\u2019s possible to do, but yes, to your point, it can be hard\nto be critical while also being very clear that the criticism isn\u2019t coming\nfrom being against feminism, or against anti-racism, but from those exact\ncommitments, and an assessment of what\u2019s necessary for building a mass\nmovement.\n\nEhrenreich: Which means putting together a new kind of class out of some of\nthe parts of the old one. We don\u2019t want to turn class into just another\ndimension of identity, since class is always aspirational in the sense of\ntrying to connect people who haven\u2019t been connected before, even if they have\nthe same kinds of jobs.\n\nPress: What do you mean by that?\n\nEhrenreich: Well, class has elements of identity. If I\u2019m just navel-gazing,\nI\u2019d say yeah, some part of my identity does come from the old industrial\nworking class, just family-wise. Another part comes from being a woman, and so\non. But we\u2019re trying to reach beyond these limits, and some of these divisions\ntoo, and that\u2019s the challenge.\n\nI think what that requires from the PMC, first of all, is a little humility.\nListen to people. That goddamn adjunct professor should\u2019ve thought about what\nit is that foundry workers do all day, and used it as a learning experience if\nnothing else. It\u2019s a problem, and I\u2019ve seen it in among union people, too\u2014not\nan expressed contempt for their members, but a willingness to use \u201cordinary\nworkers\u201d as exhibits of sorts: \u201cOkay, now we\u2019re going to have so-and-so speak\nabout her experience trying to get some control over her schedule,\u201d but after\nthat, they shut them up. It reminds me of a time I got really mad at one union\nperson and told her \u201cHey, they\u2019re the ones who are going to lead this\nmovement. You can help, but that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nAlex Press is an assistant editor at Jacobin.
