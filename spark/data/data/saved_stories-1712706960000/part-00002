To control the\nspread of pandemic diseases and achieve rapid screening of the population,\nensuring that patients receive timely treatment, rapid diagnosis has become\nthe top priority in the development of clinical technology. This review\narticle aims to summarize the current rapid nucleic acid diagnostic\ntechnologies applied to pandemic disease diagnosis, from rapid extraction and\nrapid amplification to rapid detection. We also discuss future prospects in\nthe development of rapid nucleic acid diagnostic technologies.\n\nKeywords:\n\nrapid diagnostics; nucleic acid detection; COVID-19\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIn recent years, with numerous pandemic diseases such as COVID-19 threatening\ncountries worldwide [1], the need for a low-cost, high-sensitivity, and rapid\ndiagnostic technology has been highlighted more than ever before. RT-qPCR\ntechnology, the gold standard within the diagnostic field [2], uses specific\nprimers and high-performance enzymes to achieve nucleic acid amplification and\ndisease diagnosis. The addition of fluorescent dyes or probes empowers RT-qPCR\nwith real-time quantitative ability. However, the speed of current RT-qPCR\ntechnology cannot cope with rapid screening requirements in the face of a\nsudden worldwide pandemic disease outbreak. Nowadays, the top choice for rapid\ndiagnostic technology is antibody IgG/IgM testing, which is fast and cheap.\nHowever, antibody-based diagnostic testing exhibits a high false positive rate\nand low sensitivity, which limits its potential application as a viable\nstandard test during large-scale pandemic disease screening [3]. These\ndilemmas have led to urgent demand for the development of another reliable\ndiagnostic technology that takes both speed and accuracy into account. Rapid\ndiagnostic technology based on nucleic acid detection, which can achieve\naccurate clinical diagnosis and advances from sample processing to a result\nwithin 30 min, has thus become a major research focus.\n\nAt present, rapid diagnostic technologies are developing in a number of\ndirections (Figure 1). The first aspect involved in rapid nucleic acid\ndiagnostic technology is rapid nucleic acid extraction. Virus nucleic acid\nextraction mainly includes two steps: virus lysis (via chemical, heating, and\nenzymatic methods), and nucleic acid purification (magnetic beads-based,\nfilter-based, and so on). For faster sample processing, extraction and\npurification-free detection technology has been reported by Visseaux et al.\nand Blumenfeld et al. [4,5]. According to different requirements for nucleic\nacid quality and purity, various rapid amplification technologies are\ncompatible with different rapid extraction methods. For example, extraction-\nfree detection is more suitable when paired with isothermal amplification\n(INAA), due to the fact that isothermal amplification is more tolerated by the\namplification inhibitory fraction from the lysed sample [6]. After extraction,\nhow to amplify the target nucleic acid rapidly and effectively is the most\nconcerning issue at present. The traditional RT-qPCR improvements, including\nheat-conducting and thermal-cycling system improvements, have always been the\nfocus, and remarkable progress has been obtained in these areas, such as via\nthe deployment of convective thermocycling, oscillating flow, and continuous\nflow. In addition to traditional RT-qPCR improvements, several other rapid\ndetection technologies have been developed, among which the most typical and\nwidely studied representative is INAA. Without considering the time\nconsumption associated with thermal cycling, the primary intended functions of\nINAA are to enhance amplification efficiency, improve sensitivity, and\nsimplify the instrument. Apart from extraction and amplification, rapid\ndetection technologies for amplification products, such as CRISPR and\nbiosensors, have been developed as well. These new detection methods can\nmonitor tiny amounts of biomarkers at the early stages of amplification,\nthereby reducing the time required for diagnostics. In some high-precision\nbiosensors, nucleic acids extracted from viruses can even be detected without\nany amplification.\n\nFigure 1. General development direction of rapid nucleic acid diagnostic\ntechnology.\n\nBased on current rapid diagnostic technologies, numerous commercial rapid\nnucleic acid diagnostic machines are in competition (Table 1, Figure 2), and\nthis has triggered a new technological revolution in the field of clinical\nmolecular diagnostics. While many of these instruments build upon enhancements\nto traditional RT-qPCR, notable examples include the Mic qPCR Cycler [7] and\naAmp^\u00ae Cycler [8], which employ magnetic induction and infrared heating,\nrespectively, to refine the heating element. Another significant advancement\nis represented by the NextGene-PCR [9], which uses an oscillating flow PCR\nsystem to transform the thermal cycling approach. Additionally, there has been\na growing influx of instruments rooted in novel technological principles, such\nas ID Now COVID-19 [10], Lucira COVID-19 [11], and BG-Nova-X8 [12], all of\nwhich operate on the principles of isothermal amplification. The BG-Nova-X8\nstands out as it integrates CRISPR technology, moving beyond traditional\nfluorescent probe detection. This diverse array of devices not only marks an\nadvance in rapid diagnostic methods, but also indicates a shift towards more\nefficient and innovative solutions in molecular diagnostics.\n\nFigure 2.

Marketed rapid nucleic acid diagnostic machines for pandemic\ndiseases.\n\nIn previous reviews, rapid diagnostic technology developments relating to\npandemic diseases, and especially to COVID-19, have been elaborated on in\nseveral articles from different perspectives. Kostyusheva et al. [21]\ndiscussed the development of the CRISPR-Cas system for diagnosing infectious\ndiseases and the obstacles hampering rapid translation of the CRISPR-Cas\ntechnology into practice. Lino et al. [22] summarized the biosensors used in\nclinical diagnosis and emphasized the analyte detection capability of\nbiosensors in a reduced amount of time. Boehringer et al. [23] focused on\nlateral flow assays, which were one of the most used rapid technologies in\ninfectious disease diagnosis. Despite the progress seen in the field in recent\nyears, none of the abovementioned reviews focused on summarizing all of the\ncurrent rapid diagnostic technologies based on nucleic acid detection. In this\nreview, various widely used rapid diagnostic technologies are discussed, along\nwith their merits and limitations. Comparisons between different technologies\nare provided. In the last section, the future development direction of rapid\nnucleic acid diagnostic technology is also prospected.\n\n## 2\\. Rapid Processing\n\nFrom the perspective of the overall standard testing process, the first\nconsideration should be how to extract high-quality nucleic acids rapidly and\nefficiently from clinical samples. Clinical epidemic samples are usually\ncollected in the form of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, oropharyngeal (OP) swabs,\nthroat (TH) swabs, blood, serum, sputum, fecal matter, or urine [24]. In\nactual application, NP, OP, and TH swabs are the most recommended choices\nwhile facing the challenge of mass epidemic screening [25,26]. During the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, medical supplies and labor requirements to facilitate rapid\ncollection of clinical samples became scarce. Swabs, a low-cost, portable,\nnon-invasive, self-directed method for sample collection, became mainstream\nand relieved many pressures for society. In addition, this self-collection\nmethod can greatly reduce the risk of infection for testers. Swabs should be\nconsidered the preferred mode for clinical sample collection. Additionally, in\nsome point-of-care testing (POCT) devices, saliva, which does not require\nadditional sampling tools and has stable sampling results, was also preferred\nin many studies and showed the same test effects as NP and TH swabs\n[27,28,29].\n\nAfter collection, samples should be processed uniformly to extract nucleic\nacids from virus particles. The traditional sample processing strategy is\nbased on commercial nucleic acid extraction kits and automatic nucleic acid\nextraction machines. However, these time-consuming commercial extraction\nmethods are high-cost and need to be operated in environmentally controlled\nsettings. Esbin et al. [30] reviewed the recent COVID-19 sample processing\nmethods and showed that nowadays, sample processing has advanced into a fast,\nlow-cost, and high-throughput processing stage with the availability of many\nnew technologies and strategies. Sample processing strategy can be divided\ninto two steps: lysis and purification. Typical lysis methods include\nchemical, heating, and enzymatic lysis strategies. In practice, testing\ninstitutions prefer chemical and heating lysis over enzymatic lysis, because\nenzymatic lysis requires incubation of clinical samples with protease in the\nbuffer for a long period of time, which goes against the idea of rapid\ndiagnosis. Additionally, the storage and cost of protease are also major\nproblems affecting the viability of actual use. Smyrlaki et al. [31] tested\ndifferent pyrolysis temperatures and times, and found that the best treatment\ncondition was heating at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. In this study, the pyrolyzed samples\nwere directly used for RT-qPCR amplification, and comparable results to the\npurified sample were obtained. Direct amplification tests were also performed\non clinical samples lysed with detergents such as Triton-X-100 and Tween-20.\nThe results demonstrated that direct SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR could be applied on a\ndetergent-containing sample while a certain inhibitory effect for RT-qPCR\nstill existed. Merindol [32] also tested the direct amplification effect of\nclinical samples of COVID-19 without purification and drew the same\nconclusion. Direct use of pyrolytic clinical samples is a time-saving and\nenvironment-friendly method which can be a great choice for rapid sample\nprocessing. However, these studies showed the potential problems of high-\ntemperature cracking, which might lead to a certain extent of fragmentation\nfor long fragment nucleic acids and thus influence the test results. The work\nof Lownik et al. [17] also showed the importance of nucleic acid purification\nunder certain extreme amplification conditions.\n\nIn rapid clinical diagnosis, there is often no additional heating equipment to\ninactivate clinical samples during the sample transportation process. Chemical\nlysis is a much more common strategy for large-scale screening. Considering\nthat these biological samples and lysis buffer often have complex components\nthat are not conducive for downstream detection work, such as nucleic acid\ndigestion enzymes and a high concentration of guanidine salt, an effective\nnucleic acid purification method could play a vital role in diagnostics. For\nthe purification process, various rapid nucleic acid purification methods were\nimplemented and are shown in Figure 3. Mason [33] demonstrated a rapid (30 s),\nequipment-free purification protocol for nucleic acids using easy-to-make\ncellulose dipsticks (Figure 3A). Based on the generalized adsorption-cleaning-\nelution flowsheet of the filter-based nucleic acid purification method, this\nstudy used a cellulose dipstick to replace the commonly used microcolumn and\nobtained a good purification effect. Following on from this, Mason et al. [34]\ndesigned a cellulose disk to extract nucleic acids from plants, animals, and\nmicrobes in under 30 s (Figure 3B). Additionally, Qian et al. [35] and Li et\nal. [36] also adopted filter and polyacrylic acid (PAA), respectively, to\nfabricate rapid purification dipsticks. Qian\u2019s work achieved a 2 min rapid\nnucleic acid purification with CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated isothermal amplification\nfor visual detection of African swine fever virus, with a detection limit of 1\ncopies/\u03bcL. Li et al. integrated 3D printing techniques for high throughput and\nconvenient DNA separation (Figure 3C). In addition to dipstick and disk forms,\nmany studies have also designed different partial integration devices to\nshorten the purification time. Song et al. [36,37] demonstrated an RT-LAMP\nchip that can detect clinical samples within 30 min through preconcentration\nwith a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 copies/\u03bcL (Figure 3D). Nucleic acids\nwere adsorbed onto the filter membrane with silica particles and then directly\ninfiltrated with LAMP reaction solution, and thus the elution and 500-fold\npre-concentration of nucleic acids could be achieved.\n\nFigure 3. Rapid purification methods. (A) A rapid (30 s), equipment-free\npurification protocol of nucleic acids using easy-to-make cellulose dipsticks.\n(B) A cellulose disk to extract nucleic acids from plants, animals, and\nmicrobes in under 30 s. (C) Schematic diagram and microscopic images of the\nkey structures of the 3D-printed separator applied in an 8-tube strip. (D)\nDual filter system for ultrafast on-chip NA purification and enrichment\nwithout clogging. The upper membrane comprises large pores to filter out large\ndebris, and the lower membrane is composed of small pores coated with silica\nparticles to capture nucleic acids.\n\nFor all the studies mentioned above, the sample collection strategy was\nsimilar: clinical samples were collected by swabs, and then chemically or\nphysically lysed. In contrast, how to process the cleaved mixture is the main\nfocus in rapid sample processing. Most research is devoted to developing a\nhigh-speed, easy-to-operate, and efficient purification method, while others\noffer the answer of direct testing the crude lysates without purification. At\npresent, the dilemma of the former is how to reduce the operation time on the\npremise of reducing the associated loss of nucleic acid. Many rapid nucleic\nacid purification methods are unable to deal with low copy number samples\nwell. The problem with the latter study type is that the stability of\ndiagnostics cannot be guaranteed due to the diversity of clinical samples. For\nexample, the proportion of sputum in patients with COVID-19 at different\nstages is dissimilar. In the face of these problems, micro and nanotechnology\nmay provide the answer. Droplet technology, represented by digital PCR, can\nseparate inhibitory components from nucleic acids without purification. This\nis possible because the droplet size is extremely tiny, and can only\naccommodate a single nucleic acid molecule. In some studies [38,39], hydrogels\nwith nanopore structures were shown to achieve the same function. Sample\nminiaturization, to directly physically isolate inhibitory components, is a\nsample processing strategy that takes into account current mainstream research\nideas. With the development of micro- and nano-processing technology, these\nmay become the mainstream vehicles for rapid sample processing.\n\n## 3\\. Rapid Amplification\n\n#### 3.1. Rapid RT-qPCR\n\nFor traditional RT-qPCR, the total amplification time can be more than one\nhour. Nowadays, with the exploration of RT-qPCR enzyme reaction kinetics, the\ntime required for RT-qPCR is mainly affected by the instruments used, rather\nthan the biochemical properties of the RT-qPCR reaction system [40,41,42].\nAfter RNA reverse transcription, the PCR mainly consists of three stages:\ndenaturation, annealing, and extension. In most cases, the annealing and\nextension stages can be carried out simultaneously. In research surrounding\nPCR kinetics [43], under ideal conditions, no hold time was required for\ndenaturation and annealing while extension could occur during the transition\nbetween temperatures. Especially for short DNA amplicons, the holding time of\nthese three processes could be sufficiently omitted [44]. For example,\nMillington\u2019s work [41] showed that 98% of the PCR product could be denatured\nfor 60 bp DNA amplicon under a denaturation time of 200 ms. Based on these\ntheories, a multitude of creative instruments have been produced and can\naccomplish RT-qPCR within 30 min, which is known as rapid RT-qPCR. Developed\nby Wittwer et al. [45], the extreme PCR can accomplish clinical sample\ndetection in 10 min. These rapid RT-qPCR systems were developed based on one\nof two main directions: reaction volume miniaturization, such as in capillary\nRT-qPCR, and reaction thermal cycling acceleration, such as in convective RT-\nqPCR. These new technologies emphasize the improvement of the instrument; in\ncontrast, the past several decades of improvements in the field were focused\non the reaction system, the enzyme performance, and the primer, as well as\nprobe design.\n\nMiniaturization of RT-qPCR reaction volume can dramatically improve its\nperformance. The use of a combination of glass capillary tubes and airflow\nsystems in place of traditional polypropylene tubes and solid-state heating\nmodules was reported in [12]. The earliest application of a glass\ncapillary/airflow system was in 1991 [46], and in terms of a real-time PCR,\nthe earliest application was seen in the Roche LightCycler^\u00ae instrument in\n1996 [47,48]. Compared to polypropylene tubes, glass capillary tubes have\nhigher thermal conductivity and smaller sample requirements. The elongated\ncontainer in the shape of capillary tube also demonstrates a higher surface-\nto-volume ratio. Some studies have further shown that the small volumes of\nglass capillary tubes could increase amplification efficiency and accelerate\nPCR [49,50]. Microfluidics is another technology suitable for meeting the\nthermodynamic performance requirements of rapid RT-qPCR. The micro/nano-level\nsample volume and high thermal conductivity substrate make microfluidic chips\nan excellent choice for rapid diagnosis [51,52]. Microfluidic chips can also\neasily achieve high integration of every clinical diagnostic technology, from\nvirus lysis and nucleic acid extraction to RT-qPCR amplification and results\nvisual output. Combined with the droplet technique [53,54], bulk samples can\nbe further divided into numerous droplets to achieve multiplex detection. Ji\net al. [55] launched a machine for automated multiplex nucleic acid tests of\nSARS-CoV-2 and influenza A and B infections. With high heat cycle performance\nand small reaction volume, both capillary and microfluidic chips can achieve\nrapid detection. However, for low copy number samples, and especially for\nclinical pandemic samples, a smaller volume within the reaction system is not\nconsidered better. Dong et al. [56] showed that when reaction volume is\nsmaller than 1.3 \u03bcL, the PCR system is not suitable for clinical pandemic\ndiagnostics due to limited nucleic acid templates.\n\nAn engineered thermal-cycling system can also be a great boost for rapid RT-\nqPCR. The traditional thermal-cycling system worked by repeatedly heating and\ncooling the metal module loading the sample tubes to achieve a RT-qPCR thermal\ncycle. Traditional RT-qPCR machines, such as the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-\nTime PCR System (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), use a\ncommon semiconductor heating module and can achieve a 5.5 \u00b0C/s heating and\ncooling speed, according to the product manual. For one cycle from 60 \u00b0C to 95\n\u00b0C to 60 \u00b0C, it takes almost 13 s, without considering holding time. In\ncontrast, many new devices with direct heating methods have faster temperature\nchanges. Infrared heating [57], microwave heating, and nanoparticles are the\nthree most widely used non-contact heating methods [40,58] that can skip the\nheat transfer process to achieve rapid thermal cycles. Infrared heating and\nmicrowave heating are, respectively, based on the energy absorption from\ninfrared rays and microwaves by liquid. H\u00fchmer et al. [59] used infrared ray\nto heat a thin capillary tube of nanoliter reaction volume to achieve\neffective PCR in 30 min (Figure 4A). Although this work focused on the PCR\nprocess, the system showed the potential for rapid RT-qPCR. Similarly to\ninfrared heating, microwave heating can also accomplish super-quick direct\nheating of reaction buffer (Figure 4B) [60,61]. Sun et al. [62] showed that\nmicrowave irradiation at a constant temperature could lead to faster nucleic\nacid strand exchange, but the potential of nucleic acid breakage upsurged,\nespecially for long fragments. The nucleic acid breakage caused by microwave\nheating is still a considerable negative factor associated with this method.\nNanoparticles are another technology implicated in rapid RT-qPCR that have\ngenerated great research interest. With the plasmon oscillation effect of\nmetal nanoparticles, a direct heating method without the heating\ntransformation process can be accomplished [63]. Nicole R. Blumenfeld et al.\n[5] demonstrated a plasmonic thermocycling system in which rapid thermal\ncycling was achieved via infrared excitation of gold nanorods (Figure 4C). The\ninstrument showed a sample-to-result time of 22\u201323 min, including sample\npreparation, and a LOD of 2.2\u20134.4 copies/mL.\n\nFigure 4. Rapid RT-qPCR studies. (A) Instrumentation setup for IR-mediated\nthermocycling in capillaries. (B) Schematic of re-entrant cylindrical\nmicrowave cavity. (C) Schematic of multiplexed real-time plasmonic RT-PCR,\nwith heating driven by IR LEDs acting on AuNRs and cooling aided by a 12 V\nfan. A 488 nm laser and spectrometer setup provides real-time fluorescence\ndetection and takes a measurement at the end of each annealing/extension hold.\n(D) Schematic of dual-end heating mode of convective thermocycling. (E)\nDiagram of the different parts of the oscillating chip and their function.\n\nInnovative design of the thermal cycling mode is proposed for a rapid RT-qPCR\nsystem. Convective thermocycling is a novel thermocycling mode designed to\nincrease the amplification speed and simplify the thermal cycling system. The\nconvective PCR concept was first demonstrated in a cylindrical cavity by\nKrishnan et al. in 2002 (Figure 4D) [64]. The researchers used a single-end or\ndual-end heating source to create temperature gradients by natural convection,\ninduced by density changes of fluids [65,66,67,68,69]. Although the convective\nRT-qPCR machine could be hard to design given the high requirements\nsurrounding micro-hydrodynamics and thermodynamics, its conceptual\nsimplification of the instrument design still demonstrated an enormous\npotential for POCT devices. In the following studies, Qiu et al. [70] adapted\na thermal waveguide for precise temperature control of convective\nthermocycling. Khodakov et al. [71] fabricated a portable and battery-powered\nPCR assay that allowed for rapid and sensitive quantification of multiple DNA\ntargets with single-nucleotide discrimination, which further advanced the\napplication of convective RT-qPCR in terms of sensitivity and specificity. For\ntemperature control of thermal cycling, oscillating and continuous flow\nsystems have been proposed. The oscillating flow system successfully omits the\ntemperature change of the heating element by moving reaction tubes back and\nforth between different preheated thermostatic heat sources [72]. Witter and\nJared [73] were the first to propose the concept. They showed an extreme PCR\nsystem that delivered results in 15\u201360 s. An extreme RT-PCR, which delivered\nresults in 2 min, was further shown in 2020 by Witter et al. [74]. In the\nfollow-up study, Chen et al. [75] fabricated a 100-mm-long oscillating\nthermocycler and studied its specific performance in detail. Arumugam et al.\n[76] also demonstrated a specially designed thin-walled PCR tube and a water\nbath setup for oscillating flow RT-PCR, which could achieve RT-PCR in 12 min\nfor clinical samples without an RNA extraction step. Corresponding to\noscillating flow, continuous flow directly pushes reaction solution through a\nchannel at different temperature intervals to achieve rapid thermal cycling\n[77]. Yang et al. [78] proposed a multiplex circular array-shaped continuous\nflow PCR microfluidic chip for on-site detection of bacteria, which\nsuccessfully achieved PCR amplifying of 12 different target genes\nsimultaneously within 23 min (Figure 4E).\n\nAs can be seen from the above studies, theoretical research on RT-qPCR has\nbecome very mature. Nowadays, more attention is being paid to the optimization\nof engineering. The emergence of convective thermocycling as a representative\ntechnology proves that RT-qPCR still presents unlimited possibilities, and is\nexpected to continue to maintain its status as the mainstream method for\nmolecular diagnostics.\n\n#### 3.2. Rapid Isothermal Amplification\n\nCurrent limitations of rapid RT-qPCR center on thermocycling speed and\namplification efficiency. The advent of INAA technologies provides researchers\nwith a new approach to achieve rapid amplification without thermocycling.\nBased on the unique strand replacement activity of DNA polymerase, INAA can\nachieve nucleic acid amplification in a constant medium-high reaction\ntemperature (25\u201365 \u00b0C) with designed primers. Without the demand for\nthermocycling, INAA is faster, of higher quality, and has lower instrument\nrequirements [79]. Additionally, INNA is more tolerant of direct detection\nwithout nucleic acid purification, as compared to RT-qPCR. Lalli et al. [6]\nhave demonstrated an extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva with\ncolorimetric LAMP, which enabled rapid and sensitive detection of <10^2 viral\ngenomes per reaction in 30 min. This characterization further accelerates and\nsimplifies the INNA diagnostic process. At present, INAA technologies that\nhave been extensively studied include loop-mediated isothermal amplification\n(LAMP) [80], rolling circle amplification (RCA) [81], recombinase polymerase\namplification (RPA) [82], strand displacement amplification (SDA) [83],\nnucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [84], and others. Among all\nof these INAA technologies, the amplification time varies from as low as\nseveral minutes to 30 min or more, and the diagnostic result for clinical\nsamples is consistent with traditional RT-qPCR.\n\n#### 3.2.1. Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification\n\nLAMP was first described in 2000 by Notomi et al. [85] and has become one of\nthe most used INAA technologies. With the help of four to six primers to\nidentify six to eight different regions of the target DNA, the transcribed DNA\ncan form a dumbbell-shaped or stem-loop DNA structure, which then initiates\nthe subsequent amplification reaction. Klein et al. [86] compared the\nperformance of RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, and the results\nshowed that RT-LAMP was faster and cheaper compared to RT-qPCR. Additionally,\nRT-LAMP results could be visualized through magnesium pyrophosphate\nprecipitation during the reaction and could reduce the need for fluorescence\ndetection instruments (Figure 5A). However, as reported by Dao et al. [87],\ncolorimetric RT-LAMP detection of SARS-CoV-2 exhibited decreased sensitivity\ncompared to RT-qPCR, which was mainly caused by the high false positive rate\nobserved while using low copy number samples. RT-LAMP can be deployed as a\nmultiplex diagnostic platform [88]. Kim et al. [89] demonstrated a multiplex\nRT-LAMP assay that could target open reading frame (ORF1b) and nucleocapsid\n(N) genes of COVID-19. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was 10^4\u201310^5\ncopies within 20\u201325 min.\n\nFigure 5. Different INAA technologies. (A) The color and gel electrophoresis\nresults of colorimetric RT-LAMP with different copy numbers, as well as the\nassociated amplification curve. (B) Schematic of the RPA reaction-based\nworkflow of the integrated microdroplet array platform for ultrafast and high-\nthroughput diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. (Cycles*: fluorescence signals were\ncollected at 30-s intervals and recorded as one cycler. T_t*: represents the\ntime at which the fluorescence was equal to the threshold value during LAMP\ncycles.) (C) Schematic diagram of TMSD technology. (The M1 and M2 probe need\nto be designed according to the three consecutive segments in the template,\nnamely the a, a\u2032, b, b\u2032 and c, c\u2032 sequences annotated in the figure).\n\n#### 3.2.2. Rolling Circle Amplification\n\nRCA was first developed by Fire, Andrew, and Si-Qun Xu in 1995 [90]. Unlike\nLAMP, the samples targeted by the RCA technique tend to be circular. For\nlinear targets, a designed padlock probe is needed for amplification\nreactions. The reaction temperature of RCA is usually 37\u201342 \u00b0C. RCA products\ncan be monitored in various forms, including gel electrophoresis [91],\nfluorescence [92], and the naked eye [93]. RCA is often used to detect\nmicroRNA and infectious pathogens. Reported by Khoothiam et al. [94], a\nmultiple primer-mediated rolling circle amplification was developed to detect\nlung cancer-associated miRNAs. Liu et al. [95] also used the DNAzyme-based\nLRCA to detect miRNA-21. The signal output was based on a zinc (II)\nprotoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) system, and the LOD was 1.019 fM. Qing et al. [96]\nalso fabricated an electrochemical biosensor based on RCA and CRISPR/Cas12a\ntechnologies, and the calculated LODs for miRNA-21, Parvovirus B19 DNA, and\nadenosine-5\u2032-etriphosphate were 0.83 aM, 0.52 aM, and 0.46 pM, respectively.\n\n#### 3.2.3. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification\n\nAs one of the most used INAA technologies, RPA requires minimal sample\npreparation and offers excellent sensibility. RPA was first introduced in 2006\n[97], and uses recombinase to aid primer binding to double-stranded DNA,\nthereby replacing the denaturation step at 95 \u00b0C. Compared to other INAA\ntechnologies, the advantage of RPA is its ability to generate amplicons up to\n1 kb. Zhou et al. [82] demonstrated an RPA microdroplet array platform (Figure\n5B) that integrated a mini-pillar array and ultrasonic components to conduct\nmicrostreaming. In the presence of microstreaming, the amplification time was\nreduced to 6\u201312 min, which was 38.8\u201359.3% shorter than the control without\nmicrostreaming, and the LOD was 0.42 copies/\u03bcL for SARS-CoV-2. A winning\ncombination of microfluidics and RPA has been shown in this work.\n\n#### 3.2.4. Nonenzymatic INAA\n\nToehold-mediated strand displacement (TMSD) is an alternative cost-effective\nisothermal amplification technique based on competitive hybridization\nreactions (Figure 5C) [98,99]. Unlike other INAA technologies, interestingly,\nTMSD is a rare nonenzymatic amplification technology. Mohammadniaei et al.\n[98] demonstrated an assay based on TMSD, termed non-enzymatic isothermal\nstrand displacement and amplification (NISDA), which was able to quantify 10\nRNA copies/\u03bcL in 30 min without reverse transcription. In the testing of 164\nCOVID-19 oropharyngeal clinical samples, the NISDA assay was 100% specific and\n96.77% sensitive in the laboratory setting.\n\nAs the most considered novel molecular diagnosis method in recent years, INAA\nhas been developed rapidly. However, at present, existing theoretical research\non isothermal amplification technology is still not deep enough, and the\noverall technical standards are difficult to unify due to the diversity of\ndetection strategies. It will be important in future to consider how to\nconduct systematic sorting and in-depth theoretical research on all of the\nisothermal amplification technologies and to determine how to refine their\nmarket standards accordingly.\n\nFrom all that is mentioned above, it is clear that both rapid RT-qPCR and\nrapid isothermal amplification achieve amplification of low copy number\nsamples using different strategies. Generally, RT-qPCR is more stable, and\nisothermal amplification is faster. At present, the mainstream status of RT-\nqPCR technology remains the gold standard, but with the ongoing development of\ntechnology, isothermal amplification technology has exhibited more\npossibilities. Learning from experience with, and the theoretical basis of,\nRT-qPCR research, more in-depth research on isothermal amplification\ntechnology will become the main development trend in the future.\n\n## 4\\. Rapid Detection\n\nThe traditional detection method for amplified nucleic acids is based on\nfluorescence dyes or fluorescence probes. While fluorescence probes have\nhigher sensitivity as well as specificity and are more widely recognized in\ndiagnosis, fluorescence dyes are cheaper and there is no need for a separate\ndesign for each target. However, both fluorescence dyes and probes need\nsophisticated fluorescence detection systems, along with amplification before\ndetection when facing low copy number samples. For INNA, to simplify the\ninstrument, most studies used the macroscopic color change of the tested\nsolution to characterize amplification results. However, this semi-\nquantitative method was not sensitive enough and could only be applied to a\nsingle target [100]. In recent years, with the development of CRISPR\ntechnology, researchers have adapted the CRISPR/Cas system to characterize\nINAA results and have made great breakthroughs. In addition, biosensors are\nalso evolving with the development of material characterization and\nmicro/nano-fabrication technologies.\n\n#### 4.1. CRISPR\n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system is widely known as a gene-editing tool for its\nefficient and specific cleavage of nucleic acids. Along with the mining of its\nother novel properties, the CRISPR/Cas system has been gradually used as a\nrapid and ultra-sensitive diagnostic method based on the products amplified by\nRT-PCR or INAA [101]. Reported by Zhang et al., the CRISPR-Cas13 molecular\ndetection technique has been developed and is known as Specific High-\nSensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOKing (SHERLOCK) (Figure 6A) [102]. Unlike\nthe selective cleavage of Cas9, Cas13 has collateral cleavage characteristics\nand can cleave all substrates in the reaction system [103]. SHERLOCK is based\non the amplification products of RPA or RT-RPA. Once Cas13 identifies the\ntarget sequence, the fluorescence group is cleaved from the quenching group\nand generates a fluorescence signal. The LOD of SHERLOCK can be at the level\nof attomoles. In the follow-up study [104], the lateral flow technology for\nvisual readout was further added to replace the need for fluorescence\ndetection. Although instrument-free testing was achieved, the total detection\ntime for clinical samples was increased to 90 min. With a fluorescence\ndetector, the detection time could be reduced to less than 23 min. Apart from\nSHERLOCK, more proteins from the Cas family were adapted for rapid diagnosis.\nDoudna et al. [105,106] developed DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans\nreporter (DETECTR) technology based on the RPA-Cas12a system and Cas14 (Figure\n6B). The major difference between these two technologies is the adaptation of\ndifferent reporter molecules. Li et al. [107] combined Cas12a and traditional\nPCR technology and developed a one-hour low-cost multipurpose highly efficient\nsystem (HOLMES) (Figure 6C).\n\nFigure 6. The schematic detection mechanism of (A) Specific High-Sensitivity\nEnzymatic Reporter UnLOKing (SHERLOCK), (B) DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR\ntrans reporter (DETECTR) and (C) a one-hour low-cost multipurpose highly\nefficient system (HOLMES).\n\nIn these works, the CRISPR/Cas diagnosis system showed its exceptional\npotential for increasing LOD, simplifying instrumentation, low diagnostics\ncost, and a great potential to be the next generation of diagnosis [108]\ncompared to the traditional fluorescence methods. However, various challenges\nsuch as quantitative detection limitation [109], off-target effects [110], and\ntarget sequence limitations [111] are still in the way and need to be overcome\nin future studies.\n\n#### 4.2. Physical and Chemical Biosensor\n\nBoth traditional and CRISPR detection methods depend on nucleic acid\namplification to detect trace amounts of biomarkers contained in clinical\nsamples. Based on electrochemistry [112,113,114,115,116], optics\n[117,118,119], and other principles, biosensors can convert the biological\nresponse into a visual physical or chemical signal to accomplish\namplification-free and enzyme-free detection.\n\n#### 4.2.1. Electrochemistry Biosensor\n\nThe electrochemistry principle is a commonly used technology in biosensor\ndesign. The electrochemical nucleic acid biosensor is based on electrochemical\nsignal changes during nucleic acid hybridization with single-base specific\nrecognition and high sensitivity. Initially, the passive hybridization adopted\nin most DNA-based electrochemical biosensors required several hours to reach a\ndetectable signal level [112], which bottlenecked the rapid detection\ncapability. An external electric field was then demonstrated to accelerate the\nhybridization interaction. Edman et al. [120] were the first to reveal the\nsynergy between nucleic acid interaction and external electric fields. The\nfollow-up works [121,122] demonstrated a dramatic reduction in reaction time\nunder a non-sinusoidal alternating voltage. With the development of two-\ndimensional materials including graphene and graphene-related materials,\ntransition metal carbides, carbonitrides, nitrides (MXenes), and transition\nmetal dichalcogenides (TMDs) [123], extremely high sensitivity, to the degree\nof almost a single nucleotide, and a rapid rate of response has been shown.\nFor example, Ji et al. [124] demonstrated a graphene microelectrode biosensor,\nmodified with a tentacle and a trunk, which could detect SARS-CoV-2 RNAs\nwithin 1 min down to 4 copies in 80 \u03bcL without nucleic acid amplification\n(Figure 7A). In recent years, with the development of electrochemistry, many\nother technologies have been used to improve the sensitivity and diagnostic\nspeed of biosensors. The addition of redox metal ions is another effective\nstrategy to enhance detection speed and sensitivity. Specific redox metal ions\ncan selectively and effectively intercalate into double-stranded nucleic acids\nto stabilize construction when sequence mismatch occurs [125,126]. Based on\nthis phenomenon, Yoon et al. [127] designed a sensing probe that could\nhybridize with target RNA to numbers of mismatched sequences and thus directly\nused the intercalated redox metal ions as a redox probe (Figure 7B). Due to\nintercalated metal ions having outstanding redox properties, a higher\nsensitivity could be achieved compared to traditional probes. Additionally,\nbased on an entropy-driven amplified electrochemiluminescence (ECL) strategy,\nFan et al. [128] modified DNA tetrahedrons on the surface of the electrode to\nenhance the ECL intensity, and achieved high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 with a\nLOD down to 2.67 fM.\n\nFigure 7.

(D) Schematic of the Cy3-based biosensor for the detection of\ncomplementary DNA. (E) The schematic diagram of SERS detection of SARS-CoV-2\nbased on LFIA.\n\n#### 4.2.2. Optical Biosensor\n\nOptical biosensors are another technology that have gained widespread\nadoption. These technologies include colorimetric biosensors, fluorescence\nbiosensors, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) biosensors, and Surface\nPlasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensors. Optical biosensors convert the optical\nsignals of probes or biomarkers to a real-time qualitative or quantitative\nresult.\n\nA colorimetric biosensor is a traditional optical biosensor that records\ndetection results through the color change of the solution. Moitra et al.\n[129] reported a colorimetric biosensor based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)\n(Figure 7C), which could detect the N-gene of positive COVID-19 cases within\n10 min from isolated RNA samples, with a LOD of 0.18 ng/\u03bcL of RNA. The\nadvantages and disadvantages of colorimetric biosensors are obvious: they pose\nan extremely simple detection method, but have low sensitivity. Compared to\nother optical biosensors, colorimetric biosensors are more compatible with\nimmune-based detection methods from the point of view of sensitivity.\n\nThe fluorescence biosensor is the most used optical biosensor. It adopts\nfluorescence materials [130,131] to perform signal output. The classic\nfluorescence biosensor is based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer\n(FRET), which was first proposed by F\u00f6ster in 1948 [132]. For pandemic disease\ndiagnosis, the target nucleic acid sequences competitively match to the\nacceptor molecules, changing the distance between the donor and receptor\nmolecules, which results in fluorescence quenching or activation. Based on\nFRET, Bardajee et al. [133] used Cy3 as a donor pair, and BHQ2 as a receptor\npair for the detection of clinical COVID-19 RNA samples (Figure 7D).\n\nRaman spectroscopy is a widely used optical characterization method for\nmolecular vibrations. With the help of SERS [134], the weak signal of Raman\nspectroscopy was further enhanced, and the SERS biosensor was developed. SERS\nbiosensors can be divided into labeled [135,136,137] and label-free SERS\nsensors [138,139,140]. For labeled SERS, a high Raman scattering cross-section\nreporter molecule is used, and the reporter molecule can interact with the\ntarget molecules on the biosensor. While detecting, the reporter molecule\naffects the quantitative and qualitative results of the target molecule. On\nthe contrary, label-free SERS directly detects the Raman spectroscopy signal\nof target molecules that are captured by the substrate. In comparison, the\nlabel-free SERS biosensor can show more information on target molecules, but\nfaces the challenge of a weak spectroscopy signal. The labeled SERS biosensor\nis more commonly used, but is complicated to design. Wang et al. [141]\ndemonstrated a new class of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based\nlateral flow assay (LFA) biosensor (Figure 7E), which could detect Kaposi\u2019s\nsarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and bacillary angiomatosis (BA) DNA in\n20 min.\n\nSPR is a traditional optical phenomenon [117]. While the light is completely\nreflected on the surface of prism or metal film, a vanishing wave will form\nand go into the photohydrophobic medium. In a particular situation, the\nvanishing wave can resonate with the plasma wave of the medium itself, and\nthis resonance phenomenon is called SPR. Based on this phenomenon, the SPR\nbiosensor records the change in resonance angle to achieve a real-time\nabsorption and dissociation detection of a target molecule on the detector\nsurface [142]. SPR biosensors could be divided based on their different\ndetection methods into intensity-modulated SPR biosensors, angle-modulated SPR\nbiosensors, wavelength-modulated SPR biosensors, and phase-modulated SPR\nbiosensors. For SPR technology, the most outstanding advantages are high\nsensitivity and irreplaceable dynamic detection [143]. Akib et al. [144]\ndemonstrated the development of an Au/PtSe2/graphene-coated SPR sensor. Based\non different ligand analytes, COVID-19 viral spike RBD, single-standard RNA,\nand anti-spike protein (IgM, IgG) were successfully detected.\n\nWith regards to physical and chemical biosensors, most of the associated\nproblems are related to low detection stability and high costs. In contrast\nwith the traditional fluorescent dye detection method, biosensors often need\nto be designed separately for each target. The design cost and preparation\ntime greatly reduce the application value of biosensors. In addition, the high\nsensitivity of biosensors also mean that they are more susceptible to\nenvironmental interference, which affects detection stability. At present,\nmost biosensors are still at the level of theoretical and laboratory research.\nIn the future, more research must focus on the solutions to engineering\nproblems and the promotion of practical application.\n\nIn recent years, more and more studies have begun to focus on the\nsimplification of molecular diagnostic equipment, such as POCT. In this\nprocess, rapid detection technology plays a critically important role. On one\nhand, the strategy of rapid detection technologies is to reduce the time\nrequired for nucleic acid amplification by improving the sensitivity of\nnucleic acids, resulting in less need for front-end sample processing and\nnucleic acid amplification. In addition, many new technologies, such as CRISPR\nand biosensors, are also trying to use novel detection methods to replace the\ntraditional fluorescence detection methods, such as the colorimetric and\nelectrochemical detection methods. By using these new detection methods, the\ndemand for complex fluorescence detection equipment can be further reduced.\nAlthough the research into rapid detection technology still faces many\nbottlenecks in practical application, the subversive changes in molecular\ndiagnostic devices brought about by rapid detection technology cannot be\nignored. At present, few rapid detection strategies can significantly reduce\nthe speed of molecular diagnosis in practical application. Most of the so-\ncalled rapid diagnostic technologies are another form of colloidal gold test\nstrip. Rapid detection technology is the key to ensuring high sensitivity and\naccuracy in nucleic acid detection strategy, while at the same time being\ncomparable to immunochromatography in terms of cost, convenience, and\ndiagnosis time.\n\n## 5\\. Conclusions and Prospects\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the ideal pathogen\ndiagnostic system should be low-cost, sensitive, accurate, rapid, and require\nlittle or no specialized instrument or technical assistance [145]. During\nCOVID-19 epidemics, nucleic acid diagnostic technologies, with RT-qPCR or INAA\nat the core, were the most used commercially available diagnostic strategies.\nAntibody IgG/IgM testing dipsticks were also used as an auxiliary means of\nself-testing. Those two diagnostic strategies passed the test of the epidemic.\nHowever, with extended testing time and high dependence on professional\ntesting laboratories, the current commercially available diagnostic systems\nare still under WHO criteria.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 epidemic, numerous aforementioned rapid diagnostic\ntechnologies emerged, but were still in the early development stage. Most of\nthe emerging rapid diagnostic technologies are still at the laboratory level\nand are not suitable for clinical practice. For example, the dipstick-based\nrapid purification method showed promising results in laboratory settings, but\nwas unable to process samples on a large scale and had potential risks of\ncross-contamination [33]. The CRISPR/Cas diagnostic system faced the problem\nof stability during transportation. Additionally, technology has its inherent\nlimitations and cannot always achieve a broad spectrum of disease diagnosis.\nThe most typical example is seen in extreme RT-qPCR technology. The shortened\ncycle time makes extreme RT-qPCR suitable only for high-quality nucleic acid\nsamples and short amplicon amplification strategies [146]. The inherent high\nprimer and enzyme concentration requirement of these reaction systems also\nleads to increased false positive reports when the primer specificity is not\nhigh enough. Nowadays, rapid diagnostic technologies have been developed\nacross different aspects, including rapid extraction, rapid amplification, and\nrapid detection. In the future, integration of current rapid diagnostic\ntechnologies should be the prime direction.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, data curation, writing\u2014original draft preparation and\nvisualization, Y.L.; validation, formal analysis, investigation,\nwriting\u2014review and editing, supervision and funding acquisition, D.X.
