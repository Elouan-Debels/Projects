(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nListen\n\n12 min\n\nShare\n\nComment\n\nSave\n\nAT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon are quietly trying to weaken a $42.5\nbillion federal program to improve internet access across the nation, aiming\nto block strict new rules that would require them to lower their poorest\ncustomers\u2019 monthly bills in exchange for a share of the federal aid.\n\nIn state after state, the telecom firms have blasted the proposed price cuts\nas illegal \u2014 forcing regulators in California, New York, South Carolina,\nTennessee, Virginia and elsewhere to rethink, scale back or abandon their\nplans to condition the federal funds on financial relief for consumers.\n\nThe lobbying campaign threatens to undermine the largest burst of money to\nupgrade the country\u2019s internet service in U.S. history. Enacted by President\nBiden as part of a sprawling 2021 infrastructure law, the funds are intended\nto deliver speedy and affordable broadband to the final unserved pockets of\nAmerica by 2030 \u2014 a goal that the White House likens to the federal campaign\nnearly a century ago to electrify the nation\u2019s heartland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFor some state and federal officials, though, the fear is that the massive\ninflux of aid could fall short of its potential, particularly if Americans\ncannot afford the new broadband service in their long-neglected communities.\n\n\u201cWe will not get a chance to spend tens of billions of dollars to connect\nAmericans again,\u201d said Alan Davidson, the director of the National\nTelecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), an arm of the\nCommerce Department overseeing the program.\n\nTelecom companies have focused their lobbying on the states, which are tasked\nwith doling out the money. In Virginia, for example, AT&T hinted at the\npossibility of litigation if the state capped prices for low-income households\nas a condition of participating in the program. Officials in South Carolina\nand Tennessee, meanwhile, dropped key proposals to limit poorer residents\u2019\nmonthly bills amid opposition from cable and internet providers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOther states including Michigan, Missouri and New York relaxed some pricing\nrequirements at the insistence of groups including USTelecom, which represents\nAT&T and Verizon. In California, the group said regulators\u2019 approach \u201camounts\nto unfair market interference,\u201d an argument later echoed by Republicans in\nCongress, some of whom have benefited from industry donations.\n\nOften, the largest telecom companies have questioned the legality of the\ngovernment\u2019s attempts to limit broadband prices under the infrastructure law.\nSome companies have signaled that undesirable regulation could cause them to\nwalk away from the program entirely, jeopardizing Biden\u2019s ambitions to bring\ninternet to the communities that still do not have it.\n\n\u201cRate regulation is exactly a formula that will not allow the kind of\nflexibility that will ensure the overall [broadband] program will be a\nsuccess,\u201d said Jonathan Spalter, the president of USTelecom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut consumer advocates counter that the industry is merely trying to reap the\nbenefits of a new federal windfall without addressing one of consumers\u2019 oldest\ncomplaints about broadband: the price.\n\n\u201cThis is a requirement in exchange for a humongous government benefit,\u201d said\nGigi Sohn, executive director of the American Association for Public\nBroadband, which advocates for low-cost options. \u201cThe kind of notion that\ngovernment can require something in exchange for giving out billions of\ndollars, that\u2019s standard.\u201d\n\nThe political wrangling carries great consequence for the roughly 8.5 million\nU.S. households and small businesses that still do not have access to modern-\nday connectivity, a persistent gap known as the digital divide. For decades,\nthe government has spent billions of dollars to try to narrow this chasm, only\nto stumble amid fierce industry lobbying and complicated market forces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe latest injection of aid arrived in 2021, when Congress established the\nBroadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, as part of the\ninfrastructure law. The program allowed local officials to decide how to spend\ntheir portion of the roughly $42.5 billion pot, but it set some basic national\nparameters, primarily to ensure that newly built networks are affordable. In\ndetailed guidelines issued in 2022, the Biden administration suggested that\ninternet plans should cost consumers no more than $30 per month \u2014 though it\nallowed local officials to propose alternatives.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition, right there upfront, that if you build it, it doesn\u2019t\nmean they\u2019re going to come,\u201d said Raza Panjwani, a senior policy counsel at\nNew America\u2019s Open Technology Institute, which has advocated for low-cost\nbroadband options. \u201cYou have to build it, [and] you have to make it\naffordable.\u201d\n\nBy June 2023, the Commerce Department divvied up the money among the states,\nwhich started to design intricate plans for how to award grants to companies\nthat would build out new networks. Spalter, the head of USTelecom, described\nthe process at the time as a \u201cvital step forward toward making the goal of\ninternet for all a reality in our nation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBehind the scenes, though, lobbyists for AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon\nbegan trying to block any restrictions on what they might charge customers\nserved by taxpayer dollars.\n\nAs Michigan readied its plans for roughly $1.5 billion in new federal funds, a\ntop lobbying group for Charter and Comcast warned the state\u2019s broadband office\nin December against strict limits on prices. In a letter, the Michigan Cable\nTelecommunications Association said price limits for low-income residents\nwould be \u201cheavy-handed\u201d and \u201cimpermissible.\u201d The group did not respond to a\nrequest for comment. Comcast and Charter declined to comment.\n\nNew York officials opted to grant the industry more leeway, settling on a $65\nmaximum monthly charge for low-income customers on new federally financed\nnetworks. But Paul Vasington, a director of public policy at Verizon, tried to\ndissuade the state in December, noting that pricing caps \u201ccould discourage\nparticipation\u201d by telecom giants. In a statement, Katharine Saunders, the\ndeputy general counsel at the wireless company, added that states needed to\nwork with \u201cexperienced providers\u201d to build new networks and \u201cmake universal\nbroadband a reality.\u201d\n\nAt times, the industry even objected to states that had planned to award money\nto companies that combined the fastest speeds with steep price cuts.\n\nIn Washington state, officials last year said they would heavily favor\ncompanies that reduce the cost of gigabit fiber internet \u2014 the gold standard\nin broadband \u2014 to $75 per month in areas served by the new funds. B. Lynn\nFollansbee, a vice president at USTelecom, later said in comments filed with\nthe state that its approach \u201cpromotes a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019\u201d and \u201cencourages\napplicants to propose lower prices only in the hope of winning the grant.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTo sway regulators, telecom companies and lobbyists have stressed that most\ninternet providers already offer special low-cost plans for needy families,\nthough exact web speeds, prices and eligibility criteria can vary\ndramatically. They also point to a provision in the infrastructure law that\nbars the government from trying to \u201cregulate the rates charged for broadband\nservice.\u201d Internet providers, who lobbied for that prohibition in 2021,\nmaintain that most efforts to tie federal funds to specific pricing changes\nare illegal.\n\n\u201cThe statute was to offer a low-income program, not specifically a $30\nprogram,\" said Rick Cimerman, the vice president for external and state\naffairs at NCTA - the Internet & Television Association, whose members include\nCharter and Comcast.\n\nCimerman added that some internet providers could face financial hardship if\nthey are forced to cut costs too deeply, arguing that it is already expensive\nto build networks in hard-to-reach, sparsely populated areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThe net or end result may be some providers saying, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just not\ngoing to participate in this plan,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe opposition underscores the vast power and reach of the telecom industry,\none of the most formidable political forces in capitals across the country.\nNationwide, companies including AT&T, Comcast, Charter and Verizon spent over\n$25 million last year to influence state policymakers on a range of issues \u2014\nincluding implementation of the infrastructure law, according to local records\nreviewed by OpenSecrets. They spent an additional $117 million on federal\nlobbying in 2023, according to the money-in-politics watchdog.\n\nAt times, the political pressure has proved persuasive.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn Virginia, AT&T warned the state in a legal filing last September that\nstrict pricing requirements \u201cwould be contrary to good public policy, lead to\nlitigation and more importantly will discourage provider participation.\u201d The\ncompany requested that \u201cany rate regulation language be removed\u201d from\nVirginia\u2019s blueprint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith $1.4 billion on the line, Virginia officials last year appeared to side\nwith the telecom industry \u2014 touching off an unresolved battle between the\nstate and the federal government, which signaled it would not send Virginia\nits money without a fix. Tamarah Holmes, the director of the Virginia Office\nof Broadband, declined to comment. Megan Ketterer, a spokeswoman for AT&T,\nsaid the company is \u201cencouraging the states to follow the affordability\nprovisions\u201d in the law.\n\nA similar lobbying push greeted Tennessee, which is set to receive about $813\nmillion under the BEAD program. Last year, state officials proposed to cap\nbroadband prices at no more than $50 per month for low-income residents served\nby new federally funded networks.\n\nBy spring, however, the state had quietly deleted that price point from its\nplan, under pressure from telecom lobbyists, including the Tennessee Cable and\nBroadband Association, according to two people familiar with the matter who\nspoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the conversations. The state\ndeclined comment and, by Saturday, had removed a copy of the plan from its\nwebsite.\n\nAnn Marie Walp, the executive director of the Tennessee Cable and Broadband\nAssociation, declined to comment. Executives from Comcast and Charter serve on\nthe board of the organization.\n\nMost states\u2019 plans have not been finalized. Some states have said they intend\nto allow internet providers to raise prices on low-income Americans in limited\ncircumstances, such as to address market changes or to keep pace with\ninflation. While the Biden administration has been adamant about the need for\naffordable broadband, it has also tried to adapt its new infrastructure\nprogram to fit local economic needs, according to senior officials who spoke\non the condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions.\n\nThe policy disputes have taken on added urgency in recent weeks, as the U.S.\ngovernment braces for the imminent lapse of another federal broadband\ninitiative: the Affordable Connectivity Program, which faces the prospect of\nsharp cuts to the monthly subsidies that help lower bills for roughly 23\nmillion Americans in May. The program is set to run out of funds and cease\noperating in June.\n\nSince 2021, these payments have served as a financial lifeline for poor\nfamilies and generated a windfall for the telecom industry, allowing\ncompanies, including Charter, to attract and retain customers who might not\notherwise be able to afford high-speed internet. But Congress has repeatedly\nnot replenished the program\u2019s funds, worrying state officials who counted on\nthe money when they designed their new broadband networks.\n\n\u201cWe all drew up affordability plans assuming [the subsidy program] was\naround,\u201d said BJ Tanksley, Missouri\u2019s director of broadband development.\n\nThe state initially aimed to cap low-income plans in newly served territories\nat $30 per month, but Tanksley said Missouri changed its approach after\nreceiving \u201cpretty heavy feedback\u201d from internet providers. \u201cThere are more\nquestions than answers,\u201d he said of the uncertain federal benefit program.\n\nSome congressional Republicans have blasted the monthly subsidies as wasteful,\nwhile arguing broadly against federal intervention in the broadband market.\nHouse GOP lawmakers in December summoned Davidson, the head of NTIA, for a\ncongressional grilling, where Rep. Bob Latta (R-Ohio) raised alarm that the\noffice \u201cmay allow states to push the boundaries of what conditions they can\nimpose on broadband providers.\u201d\n\nOften, the same GOP lawmakers have sided with internet providers over the\nprovision of federal infrastructure funds. The dynamic has been especially\nevident in California, a frequent target of conservatives\u2019 ire.\n\nIn November, the Golden State proposed an ambitious idea: Companies that\nreceive federal grants could charge low-income consumers no more than $30 a\nmonth, which would be reduced to $15 if Congress does not restore funding for\nthe Affordable Connectivity Program. California said it would also prioritize\napplicants that offer ultrafast gigabit-speed broadband at $50 to everyone,\nciting research showing that 3 percent of its residents lack internet because\nit is \u201cnot worth the cost.\u201d\n\nOne month later, 16 Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee\npilloried NTIA for allowing states to pursue \u201crate regulation.\u201d The chief\nauthors of that letter \u2014 including Latta and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers\n(Wash.), the chairwoman of the committee \u2014 said the Biden administration\u2019s\nactions seemed designed \u201cto ignore\u201d Congress.\n\nEach of those lawmakers has received donations from the communications and\nelectronics sector, which includes the telecom industry, according to\nOpenSecrets, including McMorris Rodgers, who received more than $545,000 in\n2022. She has announced plans to retire from Congress this year. A spokesman\ndeclined comment.\n\nThe GOP missive echoed arguments raised by industry lobbyists in Sacramento.\nThe group CalBroadband, which represents companies including Comcast and\nCharter, had blasted California\u2019s proposed prices as \u201carbitrary.\u201d Janus\nNorman, the president of the group, added in an interview that prices should\nbe \u201cconsistent across the board so that BEAD- funded areas should enjoy, or\nhave consistency in pricing, with any other area that\u2019s not government-\nsubsidized.\u201d\n\nIn their own sharply worded legal filings, AT&T joined other telecom companies\nin rebuking the state, and USTelecom argued that California \u201cruns afoul of\nfederal law,\u201d citing Supreme Court precedent.\n\n\u201cThese proposed requirements,\u201d the group charged, \u201cequate to impermissible\nrate regulation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nPersonal finance\n\nThe basics for making smart money decisions\n\nAre you ready to buy a house?
