Five\nminutes later, Ethan was taken into custody.\n\nStudents Tate Myre, 16, Hana St Juliana, 14, Madisyn Baldwin, 17, and Justin\nShilling, 17, all died from the shooting.\n\n## Ethan charged\n\nA day later, then-15-year-old Ethan Crumbley was charged.\n\nAt the time authorities could offer no motive for the attack, however,\nprosecutor Karen McDonald said the shootings were premeditated, based in part\non a \"mountain of digital evidence\" collected by police.\n\nAfter the attack, authorities learned of social media posts about threats of a\nshooting at the roughly 1,700-student school.\n\nSheriff Mike Bouchard told reporters Ethan's parents were called to the school\non Tuesday \"for behaviour in the classroom that was concerning\".\n\nEthan was charged as an adult with terrorism causing death, first-degree\nmurder, assault with intent to murder, and possession of a firearm during the\ncommission of a felony, with the possibility of more charges being added as\nthe investigation continued. He was not granted bail.\n\nThis was the first time a terrorism charge was used for a school shooting.\n\nEthan Crumbley initially pleaded not guilty to his 24 charges. (AP: Paul\nSancya)\n\nHis lawyer entered not guilty pleas on his behalf.\n\nAt the time, Ms McDonald said police were considering charges against the\nparents.\n\nAs USA Today reported: She said responsible gun ownership was crucial to\nhelping stop tragedies, and \"those who do not do that should be \u2013 and will be\n\u2013 held accountable\".\n\n## Parents charged\n\nThree days after Ethan was charged, his parents, Jennifer and James Crumbley,\nwere also charged.\n\nThe couple seemed to disappear for several hours after the announcement of\ntheir charges, prompting authorities to issue a fugitive warrant.\n\nThey were scheduled for arraignment on four counts of manslaughter but police\nhad to search for the Crumbleys after the couple's attorney said they had\nstopped responding to messages.\n\n## If you or anyone you know needs help:\n\n  * Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467\n  * Lifeline on 13 11 14\n  * Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander crisis support line 13YARN on 13 92 76\n  * Kids Helpline on 1800 551 800\n  * Beyond Blue on 1300 224 636\n  * Headspace on 1800 650 890\n  * ReachOut at au.reachout.com\n  * MensLine Australia on 1300 789 978\n\nThe Detroit News, identifying the lawyers as Shannon Smith and Mariell Lehman,\nreported the attorneys had told prosecutors the Crumbleys would be turning\nthemselves in but that: \"Instead of communicating with us, the prosecutor held\na press conference to announce charges.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said Ethan's parents had bought the weapon used in the school\nshooting as a Christmas gift and ignored warning signs as late as the day of\nthe shooting.\n\nBoth Crumbleys pleaded not guilty to the charges and had their bail set at\n$US500,000.\n\n## The warning signs\n\nLeading up to the shooting there were a number of warning signs Ethan's\nparents ignored.\n\nA teacher saw Ethan Crumbley searching for ammunition on his phone during\nclass and alerted school officials, who left messages for his mother that went\nunreturned.\n\nIn a text message to Ethan his mum wrote: \"LOL, I'm not mad at you. You have\nto learn not to get caught.\"\n\nThe morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered a drawing Ethan made\ndepicting a handgun, a bullet and a bleeding figure. The words \"Blood\neverywhere\" and \"The thoughts won't stop \u2014 help me\" were also written.\n\nA disturbing drawing by Ethan was found on the day of the shooting. (AP Photo:\nDetroit News)\n\nHis parents were summoned to the school, where they were instructed to get\nEthan into mental health counselling within 48 hours.\n\nThey \"resisted\" the idea of taking their son home from school and did not\nsearch his backpack nor ask him about the gun.\n\nThat account was later challenged by the parents, who said they did not\nbelieve he posed a danger to the school.\n\n## In court\n\nJames Crumbley and Jennifer Crumbley proceeded to trial separately. (AP Photo:\nEd White)\n\nThe Crumbley parents and Ethan all had their cases heard separately.\n\nEthan's lawyers doubled down on the not guilty plea on January 26, 2022, where\nthey indicated he would be pleading insanity, ABC News US reported.\n\nHowever, on October 24, 2022, Ethan withdrew the insanity plea and pleaded\nguilty to all of his charges. He also admitted during questioning that he used\nhis own money to purchase the gun and claimed it was not locked away on the\nday of the shooting.\n\nJennifer and James both held onto their not guilty pleas proceeding to trial.\n\nJennifer Crumbley's trial finished on February 6, 2024, when she was found\nguilty of manslaughter.\n\nProsecutors argued she bore responsibility because she and her husband gave\ntheir son a gun and ignored warning signs of violence.\n\nJames was similarly found guilty after trial on March 14, 2024, for the same\nreasons.\n\n## The sentencing\n\nEthan, then aged 17, was sentenced on December 9, 2023, to life in prison\nwithout parole.\n\nBefore learning his fate, Ethan appeared to apologise and said the toughest\npenalty was appropriate.\n\n### Parents jailed for son's fatal school shooting\n\nIn a landmark ruling, James and Jennifer Crumbley are the first parents\nconvicted over a US mass school shooting.\n\nRead more\n\n\"Any sentence that they ask for, I ask that you do impose it on me,\" Ethan\nsaid.\n\nJennifer and James were both sentenced to at least 10 years in prison on April\n9, 2024, after both spending two years in custody awaiting trial.\n\nIn remarks before her sentencing, Jennifer, 46, expressed her \"deepest\nsorrows.\"\n\n\"My husband and I used to say we have the perfect kid. I truly believed that,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"I didn't have a reason to do anything different. This is not something I\nforesaw.\"\n\nJames, 47, also apologised to the court.\n\n\"I am sorry for your loss as a result of what my son did,\" he said.\n\n\"My heart pours out to every single one of you.\"\n\nPosted 2h ago2 hours agoWed 10 Apr 2024 at 3:14am, updated 1h ago1 hours\nagoWed 10 Apr 2024 at 3:27am\n\nShare\n\n  * Copy\n  * Facebook\n  * X (formerly Twitter)\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * ### Parents of Michigan school shooter jailed for at least 10 years\n\n  * ### US jury finds school shooter's mother guilty of manslaughter in groundbreaking trial\n\n  * ### Why Jennifer Crumbley was held responsible for her teenage son's mass school shooting\n\nMore on:\n\n  * Courts and Trials\n  * Crime\n  * Homicide\n  * Law, Crime and Justice\n  * Terrorism\n  * United States\n\n## Top Stories\n\n  * ### Nursing executives stood down pending investigation of 'potential financial irregularities'\n\n  * ### What does the government mean when it says it supports a two-state solution?\n\n  * ### Wong says peace for Israel will only come with Palestinian statehood\n\n  * ### Port Adelaide forward Jeremy Finlayson suspended for three games after homophobic slur\n\n  * Analysis by Annabel Crabb\n\n### The vicious outrage levelled at Sam Mostyn quickly failed the pub test\n\n  * ### Bruce Lehrmann's 'silence was deafening' in response to new evidence, Taylor Auerbach's lawyer says\n\n  * ### How a piece of pottery found on a beach stroll led to a discovery that could make us rethink First Nations history\n\n  * ### Senior staff did 'nothing' to monitor at-risk detainees at Unit 18, Cleveland Dodd inquest told\n\n  * Analysis by Matt Neal\n\n### What the hell is going on in Ballarat?
