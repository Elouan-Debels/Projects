The team at Optometry Advisor will be reporting on a variety of\nthe research presented by the primary eye care experts at the AAO. Check back\nfor more from the AAO Optometry 2021 Meeting..  \n---  \n  \nSustained social media scrolling has a detrimental effect on eye movement,\naccording to findings presented at the American Academy of Optometry 2021\nannual meeting, held in Boston from November 3-6. They also explored a\npotential link between oculomotor fatigue and musculoskeletal fatigue driven\nby the central nervous system following aerobic exercise.\n\nResearchers conducted a crossover study that investigated how vertical\nscrolling on social media influences vertical and horizontal saccades.\nAdditionally, it explored whether there is a potential link with oculomotor\nfatigue or musculoskeletal fatigue following aerobic exercise.\n\nThe study required 12 participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years to\nscroll on a social media platform for 15 minutes during 2 sessions. Using an\non-board application, researchers measured scrolling speed, and during 1 of\nthe sessions, participants cycled on a stationary bike for 15 minutes at 60%\nmaximum heart rate. Vertical and horizontal saccades were measured for 1\u00b0, 3\u00b0,\n5\u00b0, 7\u00b0, and 10\u00b0 amplitudes in the up/down and left/right hemifields before and\nafter the near task, using a video-based eye tracker.\n\nThe results showed a reduction in vertical saccadic peak velocity (21% to 34%)\nthat was further reduced when the near task was preceded by biking (33% to\n41%). Also, there was an increase in saccadic inaccuracy (15% to 19%) that was\nfurther increased when the near task was preceded by biking (20% to 28%). Post\nnear task, a similar but lesser reduction was seen in horizontal saccadic peak\nvelocity (14% to 29%) as well as in horizontal saccadic gain (12% to 16%).\nWhen the near task was combined with biking, this effect was aggravated (peak\nvelocity: 19% to 31%, inaccuracy: 16% to 21%), but there was no variability in\nsaccadic latency across any experimental conditions.\n\nRelated Content\n\nsiteName Optometry Advisor siteURL https://www.optometryadvisor.com siteID 26\nSocial Frailty Tied to Risk for Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome in Older\nAdults Hibah Khaja, PharmD March 22, 2024 optometryadvisor.com In a large,\npopulation-based study, researchers examined whether social frailty is\nassociated with an increased risk for... siteName Optometry Advisor siteURL\nhttps://www.optometryadvisor.com siteID 26 Incidence of Fatigue, Chronic\nFatigue Increased Significantly After COVID-19 Infection Haymarket Media\nFebruary 22, 2024 optometryadvisor.com COVID-19 is associated with a\nsignificantly increased risk for fatigue and chronic fatigue. siteName\nOptometry Advisor siteURL https://www.optometryadvisor.com siteID 26\nCompassion Fatigue: What to Do When Care Becomes Overwhelming Anastasia Climan\nFebruary 26, 2024 optometryadvisor.com Preventing compassion fatigue or\nmanaging it when it occurs can be difficult in the high stress environment of\nthe medical field. siteName Optometry Advisor siteURL\nhttps://www.optometryadvisor.com siteID 26 Smartphone-Based Near Vision Test\nShows Agreement With Radner Testing Courtney Dryer, OD March 12, 2024\noptometryadvisor.com An investigation compared the agreement of near visual\nacuity measurements obtained with a smartphone with those calcula... siteName\nOptometry Advisor siteURL https://www.optometryadvisor.com siteID 26\nNonhospitalized Patients With Post-COVID Condition Tolerate Exercise Haymarket\nMedia April 9, 2024 optometryadvisor.com Nonhospitalized patients with post-\nCOVID condition (PCC) tolerate exercise, with preserved cardiovascular\nfunction, but ... siteName Optometry Advisor siteURL\nhttps://www.optometryadvisor.com siteID 26 Tablet-Based Assessments May Reveal\nVisual Function in Patients With DME Sharon Morjig, PharmD, MSCS February 2,\n2024 optometryadvisor.com A cohort of individuals with diabetic macular edema\nperformed visual function assessments using a tablet-based application.\n\nThe researchers explain that, while we know that the human visual system is\nchallenged by near work demands, the impact of such scrolling on the\noculomotor system is still unclear due to the involvement of both horizontal\nand vertical eye movement when scrolling through social media feeds.\n\n\u201cOverall, our results suggest that sustained social media scrolling has a\ndetrimental effect on the eye movement,\u201d the report said.\n\nVisit Optometry Advisor\u2019s conference section for complete coverage of AAO\n2021.  \n---  \n  \n#### Reference\n\nRice S, Bermel L, Ho T, Johnson B, Marsh C, Chakraborty, A.
