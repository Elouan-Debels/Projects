Businesses need to reimagine\nhow their teams communicate and collaborate, and we\u2019re here to meet that need\nwith Zoom Workplace.\n\nZoom Workplace is our new, AI-powered collaboration platform designed to help\nyour organization reimagine teamwork by streamlining communications,\nincreasing employee engagement, optimizing in-person time, and improving\nproductivity across flexible work. It\u2019s everything you trust and love about\nZoom\u2019s core communications products, combined with our employee engagement,\nspaces, and productivity solutions, all within the Zoom experience, with AI\nwoven throughout.\n\nZoom Workplace elevates the experience with Zoom AI Companion seamlessly\nincluded at no additional cost*, enabling your employees to be more\nproductive, collaborate better, enhance their skills, and unlock time savings\n\u2014 without you having to pay a premium for generative AI or needing to pick who\ngets generative AI superpowers.\n\nAs an open platform, Zoom Workplace enables choice and empowers customers to\ncreate seamless experiences with our APIs, SDKs, and over 2,500 integrations\nin the Zoom App Marketplace, including integrations with Microsoft, Google,\nand others.\n\nGet to know the new Zoom Workplace and see how it can make your workday work\nbetter for you.\n\n## What to know about the new Zoom Workplace\n\nWhat if you could combine the separate communication and collaboration tools\nyou use throughout your workday, on a single platform? That\u2019s the power of\nZoom Workplace. It consolidates the disparate apps you use in a day, helping\nto create productivity gains and reduce silos by unifying how you collaborate,\ncommunicate, and share information fluidly across chat, phone, video, email,\nand more.\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the Zoom desktop app, you will notice the new Zoom\nWorkplace name throughout the app, and many new enhancements that are now\navailable:\n\n  * Simplified navigation: We\u2019ve simplified the navigation bar at the top to make it easier for you to organize and find the tabs you use most often. You can drag and drop tabs into the order you prefer.\n  * Combined meetings and calendar view: If you want a more connected view between your calendar and meetings, you can combine them into one tab with a traditional calendar and a new agenda view. Go to your online account settings to enable this.\n  * New color themes: You can choose from new color themes to suit your mood or opt for Zoom\u2019s classic dark or light themes (in your desktop app settings).\n  * Customizable meeting toolbar: In meetings, you\u2019ll see a simplified toolbar where you can turn on AI Companion, share your screen and documents, and find host tools. You can customize the toolbar by dragging and dropping items (including from the \u201cMore\u201d menu) into place.\n  * Multi-speaker view: Also in meetings, you have the option to turn on a new multi-speaker view, which highlights people who are actively speaking in the meeting. Go to \u201cViews\u201d in the top right corner of the meeting window to activate it in meetings with more than five participants.\n\nThe new Zoom Meetings experience in Zoom Workplace with multi-speaker view.\n\nWhatever you choose, Zoom Workplace puts you in charge of your experience,\nletting you work the way you work best.\n\n## Drive impact with AI Companion\n\nZoom Workplace is powered by Zoom AI Companion, an AI assistant that helps you\nsupercharge your productivity throughout your workday with high-quality,\naccurate results. According to a GigaOm study commissioned by Zoom (published\nMarch 26, 2024), AI Companion transcription performed at 95% accuracy, and in\nin-meeting questions scenarios, AI Companion delivered results that were four\ntimes faster than ChatGPT-4 web.\n\nAI Companion summarizes meetings and chat threads to help you stay updated,\nhelps you brainstorm ideas on whiteboards for stronger team collaboration, and\ncomposes chats and email drafts in a few seconds. AI Companion\u2019s federated\napproach to AI is designed to enhance the quality of your work and give you\ntime back in your busy day. With our newly announced Zoom Phone capabilities,\nyou can be more productive during and after phone calls with post-call\nsummaries, voice mail prioritization, task extraction, and more.\n\nComing soon, Ask AI Companion is a new capability that will be included with\nAI Companion. Ask AI Companion will be able to gather, synthesize, and share\ncritical information from multiple sources across the Zoom platform and from\nselect third-party applications. Ask AI Companion will also be able to\ncomplete routine tasks on your behalf, like creating meeting preparation\nmaterials with relevant content such as meeting summaries and chat threads,\ndrafting agendas, and brainstorming ideas. Ask AI Companion will be available\nthroughout Zoom Workplace, so your AI-powered digital assistant is always at\nyour fingertips, helping to elevate your performance and free up your\nschedule.\n\nAsk AI Companion will be able to gather, synthesize, and share information\nacross Zoom Workplace, help you prepare for meetings, and more.\n\n## Collaborate easily before, during, and after meetings\n\nA lot of our workdays revolve around meetings \u2014 preparing for, attending, and\nacting on the decisions made in them. As part of Zoom Workplace, you can\ncombine your calendar and meetings into one streamlined tab that helps you\neasily share information and collaborate before and after meetings.\n\nThe new combined Meetings and Calendar tab in Zoom Workplace, where you can\nattach meeting materials like files and whiteboards.\n\n  * Before meetings, you can attach pre-meeting materials and agendas and chat with attendees from the meeting card. No more hunting for your agenda before the meeting starts! And with Ask AI Companion, you will soon be able to have help preparing for the meeting as well.\n  * During meetings, you can access, share, and collaborate on pre-attached materials or access documents from third-party apps, even if they are not attached to the meeting invite. To help make document collaboration across Zoom, Microsoft, and Google more seamless, we\u2019ve introduced new co-editing and permission management capabilities for Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive assets so you don\u2019t have to waste additional time giving everyone access to documents. Coming soon, you\u2019ll be able to share multiple screens and collaborate on different documents, whiteboards, and notes at the same time.\n  * After meetings, you don\u2019t need to look around in different places for the recordings or files that might have been shared by attendees. You can access recordings, continue the conversation outside of the meeting thanks to continuous meeting chat, invite additional participants to view the recording, and access shared content \u2014 everything you need, all in one spot. In the future, you\u2019ll be able to use Ask AI Companion to help you find important information too.\n\n## Help your team be more organized with Team Chat innovations\n\nZoom Workplace helps streamline everything you need to do your best work, and\nwith Team Chat as your centralized home for asynchronous communication, you\ncan say goodbye to hunting for documents and chats across multiple tools and\nmeeting notes. We believe that everyone should have access to the best\ncollaboration tools, which is why Team Chat is included in Zoom Workplace at\nno additional cost. And it continues to expand its value.\n\nNew Team Chat tabs can help you stay organized by keeping channel-related\nassets like links, whiteboards, and resources in a single view. You can even\ncollaborate on the assets and chat at the same time.\n\nTabs at the top of your Team Chat channels can help keep files, links,\nwhiteboards, and other resources organized. The right side panel can pop out\nso you can chat and collaborate all at once.\n\nComing soon, shared spaces in Team Chat will let you create a grouping of\nchannels to better organize conversations and share those groupings with\nrelevant team members.\n\nWith our upcoming workflow automation capability, you\u2019ll be able to help\nimprove your team\u2019s productivity by automating Team Chat workflows across\nZoom, third-party apps, and internal business applications. Workflows can be\nconfigured to follow sequential and conditional logic to automate complex and\nredundant tasks like scheduling a recurring message, moving through approval\nflows, and welcoming a new user to the chat channel.\n\n## Increase employee engagement by reaching your entire workforce\n\nEffective collaboration isn\u2019t just about having the right tools in place to\nstay connected. It\u2019s also about employee relationships and trust \u2014 in each\nother and in the organization as a whole.\n\nOur employee engagement solution, Workvivo, is integrated with Zoom Workplace,\nmaking it easy for your organization to create a sense of belonging and\nengagement through shoutouts, team spaces, and employee surveys. Coming soon,\nwe'll be integrating Workvivo even more seamlessly with Zoom by offering\nWorkvivo TV for Zoom Rooms so you can instantly broadcast important updates,\nnews, and events to your workforce with Zoom-certified devices for Zoom Rooms.\n\nWith Workvivo, teams and leaders can keep employees informed through company\nor group-wide messages and spaces where employees can easily find the\ninformation and resources they need, contributing to more open, transparent\ncommunications.\n\n## Optimize in-person time and flexible work\n\nWe\u2019re all figuring out how to navigate flexible work and make the in-office\nexperience worthwhile for employees. A 2024 Harvard Business Review article\nreported that 60% of employees felt the costs \u2014 financial, time, and energy \u2014\nassociated with going into an office daily outweighed the benefits of in-\noffice time. Organizations can\u2019t rely on outdated setups to keep employees\nengaged and productive in the office.\n\nZoom Workplace has a Workspaces tab to help employees optimize their in-person\ntime and collaborate better with those outside the office. Whether you\u2019re\nreserving your desk with Workspace Reservation, preparing for a client visit\nwith Visitor Management, or finding your workstation with our wayfinding\nfeature, you can do it all from the Workspaces tab.\n\nZoom Rooms help optimize your different spaces for hybrid meetings. With our\nnew companion Zoom Rooms, you\u2019ll be able to easily pair a Zoom Rooms for Touch\ndevice with a Zoom Room and use additional inputs like the camera from the\ncompanion device for added functionality.\n\nAI-powered capabilities like intelligent director help make meetings more\ninclusive by allowing remote attendees to see and engage with their in-person\ncolleagues. Coming soon, smart name tags will make it easier to connect by\nallowing other meeting participants to see your name when you're in a Zoom\nRoom. These features enable better collaboration and connection between remote\nemployees and in-office meeting participants.\n\nSmart name tags allow other meeting participants to see your name when you\u2019re\nin a Zoom Room.\n\n## Learn more about Zoom Workplace\n\nZoom One is now Zoom Workplace \u2014 simply update your Zoom desktop app to the\nlatest version (6.0 or higher).
