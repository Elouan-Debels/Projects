But no\none in their right mind would use those outdated, underpowered dinosaurs to\nrun a contemporary business, let alone a modern weapons system, right?\n\nWrong!\n\nWhile much of the tech world views a two-year-old smartphone as hopelessly\nobsolete, large swaths of our transportation and military infrastructure, some\nmodern businesses, and even a few computer programmers rely daily on\ntechnology that hasn\u2019t been updated for decades.\n\nIf you\u2019ve recently bought a MetroCard for the New York City Subway or taken\nmoney from certain older ATMs, for instance, your transaction was made\npossible by IBM\u2019s OS/2, an operating system that debuted 25 years ago and\nfaded out soon after.\n\nA recent federal review found that the U.S. Secret Service uses a mainframe\ncomputer system from the 1980s. That system apparently works only 60 percent\nof the time. Here\u2019s hoping that uptime statistics are better for the ancient\nminicomputers used by the U.S. Department of Defense for the Minuteman\nIntercontinental Ballistic Missile system, Navy submarines, fighter jets, and\nother weapons programs. Those systems, according to the consultants who help\nkeep them going, will likely be used until at least the middle of this\ncentury.\n\nHere are a few stories of the computers that time forgot, and the people and\ninstitutions that stubbornly hold on to them.\n\n### Punch-Card Accounting\n\nSparkler Filters of Conroe, Texas, prides itself on being a leader in the\nworld of chemical process filtration. If you buy an automatic nutsche filter\nfrom them, though, they\u2019ll enter your transaction on a \u201ccomputer\u201d that dates\nfrom 1948.\n\nSparkler Filters\u2019 IBM 402, with self-employed field engineer Duwayne Leafley\nin the foreground. (Photo Courtesy Ed Thelen / IBM 1401 Group)\n\nSparkler\u2019s IBM 402 is not a traditional computer, but an automated\nelectromechanical tabulator that can be programmed (or more accurately, wired)\nto print out certain results based on values encoded into stacks of 80-column\nHollerith-type punched cards.\n\nCompanies traditionally used the 402 for accounting, since the machine could\ntake a long list of numbers, add them up, and print a detailed written report.\nIn a sense, you could consider it a 3000-pound spreadsheet machine. That\u2019s\nexactly how Sparkler Filters uses its IBM 402, which could very well be the\nlast fully operational 402 on the planet. As it has for over half a century,\nthe firm still runs all of its accounting work (payroll, sales, and inventory)\nthrough the IBM 402. The machine prints out reports on wide, tractor-fed\npaper.\n\nThe punched cards used in the 402, with some mangled cards from a recently\ncleared jam in the card reader. The cards sit on the IBM 029 key-punch\nmachine. (Photo Courtesy Ed Thelen / IBM 1401 Group)\n\nOf course, before the data goes into the 402, it must first be encoded into\nstacks of cards. A large IBM 029 key-punch machine\u2013which resembles a monstrous\ntypewriter built into a desk\u2013handles that task.\n\nCarl Kracklauer, whose father founded Sparkler Filters in 1927, usually types\nthe data onto the punch cards. The company sticks with the 402 because it\u2019s a\nknown entity: Staffers know how to use it, and they have over 60 years of\ncompany accounting records formatted for the device.\n\nThe key punch isn\u2019t the only massive accessory in Sparkler\u2019s arsenal. The 402\nalso links to an IBM 514 Reproducing Punch, which has been broken for three\nyears. When it works properly, the 514 spits out punched \u201csummary cards,\u201d\nwhich typically contain the output of the 402\u2019s operation (such as sum totals)\nfor later reuse. Sparkler stores all of its punched data cards\u2013thousands and\nthousands of them\u2013in stacks of boxes.\n\nSparkler Filters\u2019 collection of IBM 402 programs on IBM plugboards. (Photo\nCourtesy Ed Thelen / IBM 1401 Group)\n\nThe company also possesses dozens of 402 programs in the form of IBM\nplugboards. Computer programming in the 1940s commonly involved arranging\nhundreds of individual wires in a way that would likely drive a modern\nsoftware engineer insane. In the 402\u2019s case, a spaghetti-like pattern of wires\nattached to hundreds of connectors on each plugboard determines the operation\nof the machine, and different plugboards can be pulled out and replaced as if\nthey were interchangeable software disks. So you might insert one plugboard\nfor handling, say, accounts receivable, and a different one for inventory\nmanagement.\n\nSparkler\u2019s 402 is a such a significant computing relic that the Computer\nHistory Museum in Mountain View, California, sent a delegation to the company\nlast year to try and convince its executives to move to a more modern\naccounting system and donate the 402 to the museum. That will someday be an\nappropriate resting place for the 402, but as long as it still does its duty,\nthe Texas company has no problem keeping its digital dinosaur living a little\nwhile longer.\n\nNext: Modern military weapons run on ancient minicomputers.\n\n### Computers That Can\u2019t Fail\n\nWhen you see reports about the small, remote-controlled drones that the\nmilitary uses to gather intelligence and target enemies in Pakistan and\nAfghanistan, it\u2019s easy to assume that all our weaponry is equally modern. Some\nsignificant weapons systems that our military depends on today, though, run on\ntechnology that dates back, in some instances, to the Vietnam War era.\n\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s ship-based radar systems and Britain\u2019s Atomic Weapons\nEstablishment, which maintains that country\u2019s nuclear warheads, use PDP\nminicomputers manufactured in the 1970s by Digital Equipment Corporation\n(DEC). Another user of the PDP is Airbus, the French jetliner manufacturer.\n\nA DEC PDP-11 system in a photo from 1972.\n\nThe PDP was among the second wave of mainframes called minicomputers because\nthey were only the size of a couple of refrigerators instead of big enough to\nfill a room.\n\nThe F-15 and F-18 fighters, the Hawk missile systems, parts of the U.S. Navy\nsubmarine fleet, and Navy fighter test systems on aircraft carriers use DEC\u2019s\nVAX minicomputers from the 1980s for various purposes, according to Lynda\nJones of The Logical Company in Cottage Grove, Oregon, which helps keep these\nantiquated systems functioning.\n\nA DEC VAX 11/780 system in a 1978 photo.\n\nBecause of their critical nature, many of these systems will be in continuous\nservice long into the future, perhaps to the middle of this century. For\ninstance, the Minuteman ICBM program, which uses DEC VAX systems for testing,\nrecently received funding that will keep it going until 2030.\n\n\u201cThese legacy systems are integrated into multibillion dollar systems as\ncontrol or test systems,\u201d Jones says. Replacing these old systems with modern\nmachines, she explains, would cost millions of dollars and could potentially\ndisrupt national security.\n\nAs it turns out, replacing those systems with modern hardware designed to work\nlike the antiquated components is a decidedly less risky venture. Jones\u2019\ncompany is one of many that create systems to simulate older DEC minicomputers\nusing newer, smaller, and less power-hungry electronic parts. The replacement\ncomputers emulate the exact functionality of the original hardware\u2013and run the\nsame vintage software\u2013so it appears to the rest of the system as if nothing\nhas changed.\n\nThe Logical Company\u2019s NuVAX 3200, a modern system that replicates a DEC VAX.\n\nThat\u2019s important because most of Logical\u2019s customers are defense corporations\nrefreshing old weapons technology under contract with the U.S. Department of\nDefense. \u201cThere are thousands of DEC systems in use for military applications\naround the world,\u201d says Jones, \u201cincluding PDPs from the 1970s, VAXes from the\n1980s, and Alphas from the 1990s.\u201d\n\nThe United States developed many fighter jet and missile systems during the\nCold War era using DEC hardware for test and control functions, says Jones,\nbecause the company\u2019s minicomputers were among the very first general-purpose\nmachines that did not require water cooling and could be used in harsh\nenvironments.\n\nThe biggest problem with maintaining such ancient computer systems is that the\noriginal technicians who knew how to configure and maintain them have long\nsince retired or passed away, so no one is left with the knowledge required to\nfix them if they break.\n\nEven if someone does know how to fix them, finding replacement parts can be\ntricky. Stanley Quayle, a computer emulation consultant, has seen contractors\ndesperate to find the parts they need. \u201cI have a prospective customer\nsupporting a U.S. missile defense system that is buying parts on eBay,\u201d says\nQuayle. \u201cAny parts they do find are as old or older than their system,\u201d\nmeaning they\u2019re sometimes no more reliable than the pieces they replace.\n\nNext: A warehouse run on an Apple IIe.\n\n### The Apple IIe Warehouse\n\nLots of people fell in love with the Apple IIe when it was released in 1983.\nIt supported a wide variety of software and hardware, it was reliable, and its\nseven internal expansion slots made it extremely flexible.\n\nKevin Huffman sitting next to his Apple IIe at Huffman Industrial Warehouse in\nNorth Carolina.\n\nFor Kevin Huffman, who owns and operates Huffman Industrial Warehouse in Eden,\nNorth Carolina, that love has never waned. His firm stores and ships out goods\nfor companies that rent his warehouse space, and he regularly uses his vintage\nApple IIe to track inventory and keep accounts.\n\nHuffman got started with the Apple II line in college and later bought two\nidentical Apple IIe systems from his brother-in-law in the mid-1980s, one of\nwhich he uses today. (He keeps the other unit as an emergency backup.)\n\nHuffman\u2019s Apple IIe setup is nothing fancy, but it is fully stocked. It\u2019s\nequipped with 128 kilobytes of RAM, the standard 1MHz 6502 CPU, and AppleSoft\nBASIC in ROM. It contains five expansion cards: a printer card, two disk\ninterface cards, a serial port card, and an 80-column video card. For\nperipherals, he uses an Apple DuoDisk unit, a 10-inch amber video monitor, and\na trusty workhorse of a printer\u2013a Star NP-10 that \u201cis still going strong at\n26-plus years old,\u201d he says.\n\nKevin Huffman\u2019s boxes of the six programs in the Manzanita \u201cThe Business\nAccountant\u201d software suite for the Apple IIe.\n\nHuffman runs an application suite on the Apple IIe called \u201cThe Business\nAccountant,\u201d first published by Manzanita Software in 1984. Of the six\napplications in the suite, he uses five: General Ledger, Accounts Payable,\nAccounts Receivable, Inventory, and Payroll. All of his data resides on the\nonce-standard 5.25-inch floppy disks, but he\u2019s not worried about data\nsecurity: \u201cI back up the floppies with a program called Copy II+.\u201d\n\nHuffman uses a modern PC for word processing, email and Web browsing, but he\u2019s\nreluctant to move away from his trusty Apple IIe for accounting work.\n\n\u201cI still use the machine because it is so simple to use, I know the software,\nand I can still update the tax tables manually.\u201d He adds, \u201cThe only glitch in\nthe entire system is that it does not recognize the year 2000, so all my\nprinted financial reports say 1912. But on the invoices, checks, and other\nforms, it prints in the 11/14/12 format.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s even tried emulating the Apple IIe and his favorite software on a modern\nmachine, but to him, the full experience matters. \u201cI thought about changing\nover to a more modern system, but there is nothing to be gained. As the old\nsaying goes, \u2018If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.'\u201d\n\n### The Color Computer Programming Assistant\n\nJohn Kowalski\u2019s Tandy Color Computer 3 running BBS software in a photo from\n1996.\n\nFew vintage computers inspire as much active devotion as the Tandy Color\nComputer 3, first introduced in 1986. The CoCo 3 (as it is affectionately\ncalled by its fans) never sold as many units as home computers from Atari or\nCommodore, but that engendered an even stronger loyalty in its users.\n\nThe CoCo 3 marked the end of a well-received line of Color Computer products\nfrom RadioShack, which launched the first model in 1980. The third model in\nthe series turned out to be an impressive swan song, adding support for 512KB\nof memory and implementing advanced graphics and sound enhancements\u2013all while\nretaining backward compatibility with pre-CoCo 3 software.\n\nJohn Kowalski\u2019s self-portrait from 1998\u2013in front of a wall of Color Computer 3\nunits.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable, then, that some folks refuse to let go of their CoCo 3\nunits for either work or play. One such loyal user, John Kowalski, a former\nconsole game developer, still considers his CoCo 3 an indispensable tool.\n\n\u201cI turn it on, type in a quick program to do something I need done, and let it\nrun to get the results,\u201d says Kowalski. \u201cI think of it as my personal\nassistant\u2013sometimes I program it to do tedious or repetitive tasks like\nautomated document reformatting, and I can continue working while it works\nbeside me.\u201d\n\nKowalski began his journey in CoCo-land with a Color Computer 2 in 1984. He\ntraded up to the CoCo 3 in 1986 and stuck with the platform through the years,\nperforming various hardware upgrades (upping the system RAM to 2MB and\noverclocking the 6809 CPU to a blistering 3.5MHz) along the way.\n\nThe cover of the Namco Museum 50th Anniversary game for the PlayStation 2, a\ngame that Kowalski\u2019s CoCo 3 helped to create.\n\nWhen Kowalski was programming console video games at Crystal Dynamics in the\nmid-to-late 1990s, his vintage CoCo 3 played a prominent role. \u201cEvery game I\nworked on had at least some data in it created on the CoCo,\u201d he says. Titles\nlike Namco Museum 50th Anniversary and Tron 2.0: Killer App benefited from the\nvintage machine, which Kowalski used as if it were a powerful programmable\nscientific calculator.\n\nFor an original title like Tron 2.0 for the Xbox, Kowalski used the CoCo 3 to\ntest 3D techniques used in the game. \u201cMany of the data sets used by the 3D\nengine were generated on the CoCo, like the tables for calculating depth and\nperspective in the 3D view, and the data for fish-eye reduction of the view,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cThe texture map graphics used in the game were also translated into\nprogram data by a conversion tool I wrote on the CoCo.\u201d\n\nIf speed wasn\u2019t an issue, Kowalski would quickly type up a program in the\nCoCo\u2019s built-in BASIC interpreter. In the cases that involved large amounts of\ngraphics or sound data, he would turn to assembly language.\n\nThe cover of Tron 2.0: Killer App for the Xbox.\n\nThe latter technique proved quite handy when working on Namco Museum or Atari\nAnniversary, which both contained reworkings of classic 1980s arcade games.\nKowalski used the CoCo to extract, convert, and edit graphics data from the\noriginal arcade ROMs into formats a PlayStation 2 console could use. He also\nused the CoCo to translate vintage arcade source code and clean up sound\nsamples used in the games.\n\nWith such an old machine, you might think it would be hard to export the\nworking data to a more modern PC, but Kowalski has found no such problems. For\nyears, he swapped standard 5.25-inch disks between his CoCo 3 and a Windows\nPC. Today, he simply connects a serial port between the CoCo and a PC, with\nthe PC acting as a virtual disk drive emulator.\n\nKowalski says his current job designing electronics hardware doesn\u2019t call for\nmuch data generation, so he doesn\u2019t use the CoCo as frequently. But he hasn\u2019t\nretired the classic machine; Kowalski keeps the 25-year-old PC on his main\ncomputer desk, ready to be called back into service at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nPCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and\nthe advice you need to get the job done.\n\n  * Policies\n\n    * Privacy Policy\n    * Cookie Policy\n    * Copyright Notice\n    * European Privacy Settings\n    * Member Preferences\n    * Editorial independence\n    * Licensing & Eprints\n    * California: Do not Sell my Personal Info\n\n  * About\n\n    * About Us\n    * Advertise\n    * Ad Choice\n    * Contact Us\n    * Foundry Careers\n    * GamePro\n    * Smart Answers\n\n  * PCWorld Categories\n\n    * Business\n\nLaptop\n\nMobile\n\nPC Hardware\n\nDeals\n\n  * Subscribe\n\n    * Digital Magazine - Subscribe\n\nManage Subscription\n\nGift Subscription\n\nNewsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 IDG Communications, Inc.\n\nTop Of Page\n\n", "frontpage": true}
