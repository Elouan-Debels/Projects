They were stymied by her question, for if they\nshould answer yes, they would be saying that they should instead have said no,\nand if they should answer no, then it would mean that they should have said\nyes. My daughter had trapped them in an impossible logical labyrinth.\n\n###\n\nEpimenides paradox\n\nA much earlier logical labyrinth occurred on the island of Crete in the 6th\ncentury BC, when Epimenides announced\n\n> All Cretans are liars.\n\nBeing a Cretan himself, you see, Epimenides was in particular calling himself\na liar. Does this mean that the statement itself is a lie?\n\nWell, for someone to be a liar, must everything they say be a lie? I don't\nthink so. If someone tells lies only some of the time, then I would call them\na liar, even if at other times they tell the truth. (I don't feel similarly\nabout describing someone as honest or as a truth-teller\u2014they must be reliably\nhonest for this designation.) So it seems that Epimenides could consistently\nbe telling the truth with this particular statement, even if, as seems\ndubious, every Cretan including Epimenides himself has told a lie at some\npoint.\n\nSome accounts of Epimenides have him saying:\n\n> Cretans are always liars.\n\nDoes this change things? I don't think so, not much. After all, a musician is\nstill a musician when the song has ended; an artist remains an artist when the\nbrush is put down. And so also with liars. If all Cretans have told a lie,\nthen they will always be liars from now on, even if they sometimes assert\ntruths.\n\nConsider, in contrast, the more extreme statement:\n\n> All Cretans always lie.\n\nThis is a totally different situation. Epimenides cannot truthfully make this\nstatement, for if he is truthful here, then in virtue of the meaning, since he\nis Cretan, his statement must also be a lie. But can the statement be a lie?\nWell, it certainly seems so, and in fact I find it very likely that the\nstatement is not true, since I believe that most Cretans are good honest\npeople, who seldom lie. This statement could merely be one regrettable case of\na Cretan untruth, with the truth being that only some Cretans lie and even\nthen only sometimes.\n\n###\n\nThe liar paradox\n\nThe liar paradox refers to the troubling conundrum we face when trying to\nassign a coherent truth value for the following sentence, known as the liar\nsentence or sometimes personified simply as the liar.\n\n> This sentence is false.\n\nThe liar thus asserts its own falsity.\n\nThe central problem is that if the sentence were true, then precisely because\nof what it asserts, it would also have to be false, contrary to the\nassumption; but if it were false, then again precisely because of what it\nasserts, it would have to be true. It seems that the sentence, therefore, can\nbe neither true nor false, posing a fundamental challenge for a complete and\nsuccessful theory of truth.\n\n###\n\nThe no-truth-value solution strategy\n\nPerhaps one might hope to resolve the liar paradox by saying simply that the\nliar sentence has no truth value. It expresses a proposition that is neither\ntrue nor false, a gap in the truth values. Can one dissolve the liar paradox\nthis way?\n\n####\n\nThe liar's revenge\n\nSome philosophers rebut that response by introducing the following sentence,\nknown as the liar's revenge:\n\n> Either this sentence is false or it has no truth value.\n\nIf the liar's revenge were true, then in light of what it asserts, it would\neither be false or have no truth value, but both of those contradict the\nassumption that it is true. If it were false, in contrast, then in light of\nthe first clause it would have to be true, which is again a contradiction.\nFinally, if the liar's revenge had no truth value, then precisely because of\nwhat it asserts in the second clause, it would be true, which would contradict\nthe assumption that it had no truth value. So it seems wrong to say of the\nliar's revenge that it is true, wrong to say that it is false, and also wrong\nto say that it has no truth value. Crazy!\n\nThe liar's revenge thus seems to undermine the no-truth-value strategy of\nanswering the original liar paradox. If that strategy were robust, then we\nshould expect it also to work for the liar's revenge, which doesn't seem to be\nthe case.\n\n####\n\nFalse versus not true\n\nSome philosophers prefer to state the liar sentence as the assertion:\n\n> This sentence is not true.\n\nThat is, they prefer to take the liar to assert its own untruth as opposed to\nits own falsity. They do so in order to avoid a possible objection that could\nbe made by someone who finds a distinction between \u201cnot true\u201d and \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nA straightforward approach to truth and falsity might take false just to mean\nnot true, especially when applied to sentences with a definite meaning, and\nwith this account the need for a modified statement of the paradox may seem\nless urgent. But meanwhile, if there will be question of meaningfulness, then\nperhaps it will be better to use \u201cnot true\u201d in place of \u201cfalse.\u201d For example,\nwould you say that the following sentence is false?\n\n> 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\n>\n> Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.\n\nOr how about this one\u2014would you say it is a false sentence?\n\n> Shillyhumph ghghx88shhs.\n\nIt would seem reasonable to say instead that these assertions are nonsense,\nwithout any meaning\u2014they are neither true nor false, because they do not\nexpress any proposition. But in this case, the sentences would reveal a\ndistinction between falsity and untruth, for we have said that these sentences\nare not false and yet they are not true. The sentences thus show that being\nfalse is not the same as being untrue.\n\nBut notice how the not-true formulation of the liar paradox thus seems to take\non board much of the liar's revenge reasoning. Namely, if the sentence were\ntrue, then it should not be true; and if it were not true, then it should be\ntrue. This latter reasoning seems to work whether or not the sentence has a\ntruth value, since if the sentence had no truth value, then in particular it\nwouldn't be true, and so what it says would be the case. So it would be true\nafter all. For this reason, the not-true formulation of the liar sentence can\nbe seen already as an efficient form of the liar's revenge.\n\n####\n\nObvious truth\n\nMeanwhile, if you should reflect on the matter, the following sentence\n\n> This sentence is not obviously true.\n\ndoes seem indeed to be true. If it were obviously true, then in particular, it\nwould also be true, which in virtue of what it says would mean that it is not\nobviously true, a contradiction. So it isn't obviously true, which is just\nwhat it says. So it is true, but not obviously true.\n\nConsider in contrast the sentence:\n\n> This sentence is obviously not true.\n\nIt cannot be true, since then it wouldn't be. That is obvious. So it is\nobviously not true. But that is just what it asserts!\n\nI find it interesting to consider the obvious operator and how it interacts\nwith logic. For example, it seems clear that \u201cobviously not \u03c6\u201d implies \u201cnot\nobviously \u03c6,\u201d but not always conversely, since perhaps the question of \u03c6 or\nnot \u03c6 is confusing\u2014not obvious either way\u2014in which case we would have both\n\u201cnot obviously \u03c6\u201d and \u201cnot obviously not \u03c6.\u201d It seems reasonable to claim that\nobviously (A and B) is equivalent to (obviously A) and (obviously B), but the\nsimilar claim for disjunction \u201cor\u201d seems wrong. That is, obviously (A or B)\ncan be true even when neither A nor B is obvious. What is the logic of\nobviousness?\n\n####\n\nThe both-true-and-false solution strategy\n\nSome philosophers embrace a solution strategy for the liar paradox by\ndeclaring that it is both true and false. In paraconsistent logic, for\nexample, there can be true contradictions, statements that are both true and\nfalse. These would be truth-value gluts, as opposed to gaps, as in the no-\ntruth-value solution strategy we considered earlier. In the paraconsistent\napproach to a theory of truth, one develops not only the theory of truth, but\nalso a simultaneous theory of falsity, with the idea in mind that these\ndesignations might overlap. And indeed they do overlap in the liar sentence,\nwhich is declared both true and false. Does this resolve the paradox? To my\nway of thinking, no, it does not bring us insight, but can be seen rather\nmerely as pointing at the paradox, underlining it and taking it fully on board\nby incorporating it into the very foundations of the logic, but not resolving\nit in any way. Paraconsistent logic itself, after all, is as paradoxical as\nthe liar paradox\u2014it does not seem to help us find our way out of paradox.\n\n###\n\nAvoiding self-reference\n\nPeople often observe that the liar sentences exhibit a self-referential\nnature, with each sentence making an assertion about itself. And perhaps it is\nnatural to become suspicious of self-reference when it seems to be featured\nprominently in such paradoxes. Is self-reference itself the source of\nparadoxicality?\n\n####\n\nThe twin liars\n\nSome philosophers attempt to eliminate the self-reference from the liar\nparadox by various means. Consider, for example, the following pair of\nsentences, which I dub the twin liars.\n\n> The next sentence is true.\n>\n> The previous sentence is not true.\n\nEach sentence refers only to the other sentence and not directly to itself,\nand so in this way they might plausibly be described as having avoided self-\nreference. Meanwhile, these sentences together exhibit the liar paradox logic.\nNamely, if the first sentence is true, then the second must be true, which\nmeans the first sentence is not true after all. And if the first sentence is\nnot true, then in light of what it asserts, the second sentence must not be\ntrue, in which case the first sentence is true. We have thus reached a\ncontradiction in any case.\n\n####\n\nIndirect self-reference\n\nAnother attempt to avoid self-reference, which I have heard from philosopher\nHartry Field, is to describe a situation where the liar agent does not refer\ndirectly to himself. For example, imagine that someone is walking on the\nstreet and sees a live television broadcast in a store window of a person\ntalking, and he says,\n\n> What that person on the television is saying right now is not true.\n\nBut actually the person being shown on the television is himself right in that\nmoment, and what he was saying just then is the very same utterance. Does this\navoid self-reference?\n\nMy own considered view is that self-reference is not especially worrisome or\nproblematic, and there is no urgent need to avoid it. Indeed, we shall discuss\nin a later section a remarkable mathematical theorem showing that any\nsufficiently strong mathematical language admits the capacity for self-\nreferential assertions, even just in the formal language of arithmetic. The\nbasic idea is that formal mathematical assertions can be represented with\nnumbers, by encoding their syntactic symbols into the digits of the number,\nfor example, and since arithmetic assertions can make assertions about these\nnumbers, they can thus refer to themselves and even express their own\nprovability or consistency. The fact of the matter is that self-reference is\ninextricably a part of every minimally sufficient mathematical theory.\n\nMeanwhile, my view also is that the attempts we have mentioned to avoid self-\nreference in the liar are not actually successful\u2014self-reference remains\u2014and\nyet self-reference is not ultimately the source of paradox. I do not place the\nblame on self-reference, but rather on mistaken ideas concerning the nature of\ntruth.\n\n###\n\nThe infinite liar\n\nLet us now consider another attempt to avoid self-reference in the liar\nparadox by constructing an infinite list of sentences, a system of assertions\nI call the infinite liar.\n\nThis scheme of sentences is also known as the Visser-Yablo paradox, discovered\nby Albert Visser and Stephen Yablo. Each sentence asserts the falsity of all\nthe later sentences on the list.\n\nIf any of the sentences in the list were true, than all subsequent sentences\nbelow it would be false; but in this case, in light of what they assert, they\nshould all be true, contrary to what we just said. So none of the sentences\ncan be true, and so they are all false. But given this, in light of what they\nassert, they should all be true. We reach a contradiction in any case.\n\nHere is a variant dual form of the infinite liar.\n\nIf any of the sentences were to be false, then in virtue of what that sentence\nasserts, there would be no false sentences subsequently. But then all the\nsubsequent sentences, in virtue of what they assert, would be false, contrary\nto our conclusion that none of them are. So none of the sentences can be\nfalse. And therefore, in virtue of what they assert, all of them are false.\nContradiction.\n\nPart of the explicit motivation for constructing the infinite liar was to find\na version of the liar paradox that avoided self-reference. Although each\nsentence in the infinite liar refers only to the later sentences and not to\nitself, in my view the infinite liar still partakes of self-reference. Each\nsentence in the infinite liar refers in effect to its own place in the system,\nsince the sentences it refers to directly are \u201cbelow\u201d the given sentence, and\nthis is a form of self-reference. We cannot, for example, rearrange the\nsentences to have an upward oriented structure or another arrangement entirely\nand preserve the referents.\n\nThe infinite liar is often presented as an indexed family of sentences s_0,\ns_1, s_2, and so on, with a sentence s_n for each natural number n:\n\nHere, the sentence s_n refers most directly to the sentences s_k for k > n.\nBut to my way of thinking, the mention of n here in the sentence s_n is\nalready a form of self-reference. Furthermore, one naturally regards the\nscheme of sentences in parametric form s(n), with the sentence s(x) in general\nform having a free variable x not yet specified, asserting\n\nAnd this formula s is clearly self-referential.\n\nWe can adapt the revenge idea also to the infinite liar as follows:\n\nIf any of the sentences lacks a truth value, then all the sentences above it\nwould be true. So there can't be two sentences lacking a truth value. From\nsome point on, therefore, all of the sentences must have truth values. If any\nof them below that point were true, then every sentence below that must be\nfalse, but in that case, in light of what those sentences assert, all the\nsentences below would be true, contrary to what we just said. So eventually,\nthe sentences all have a truth value, but none are true. So they are all\nfalse. But in this case, in light of what they assert about the later\nsentences, they must be true. So there is no way for them to be true or false\nor to lack a truth value.\n\nOr perhaps one prefers the \u201cnot true\u201d formulation, which as we argued\npreviously is a form of the liar's revenge.\n\nIf any of them is true, then all subsequent sentences are not true; but in\nthis case, in light of what they assert, they should all be true.\nContradiction. Thus, none of them is true. But in this case, they should all\nbe true. This reasoning seems to work even when one entertains the possibility\nthat the sentences might be neither true nor false.\n\n##\n\nThe Liar (a logic song)\n\nA logical music video made in collaboration with the supremely talented Hannah\nHoffman.\n\nFor more math/philosophy/logic videos, see my Music Videos section.\n\n##\n\nThe disquotational theory of truth\n\nThe disquotational theory of truth consists of the idea that what it means to\nassert that a sentence is true is simply to assert the sentence itself.\n\n> \u201cSnow is white\u201d is true if and only if snow is white.\n\nMore generally,\n\nThus, according to this theory making a truth assertion amounts simply to\nremoving the quotation marks\u2014it is disquotational.\n\nThe disquotational theory of truth is sometimes described as a deflationary\naccount of truth, in that it deflates what might otherwise be an overblown\ncomplicated approach to truth\u2014a sentence is true, in the disquotational\ntheory, simply if the proposition that it asserts is the case. In this sense,\nevery particular use of the truth concept for a specific assertion is\neliminable, since we can instead assert the content of that sentence.\n\n####\n\nThe use/mention distinction\n\nThe disquotational theory of truth builds a bridge between use and mention,\ncrossing the use/mention dichotomy, the distinction between using a word and\nmerely mentioning it. In an earlier chapter, I had related the story of my\nOxford colleague who at high table had announced that he generally uses pants\nas trousers, or perhaps merely \u201cpants\u201d as \u201ctrousers,\u201d which would be much less\nshocking; and we discussed my daughter's question concerning whether\neverything rhymes with itself\u2014or was it whether \u201ceverything\u201d rhymes with\nitself? Or whether everything rhymes with \u201citself\u201d? By convention we typically\nindicate a mention as opposed to a use of a word by enclosing it within\nquotation marks.\n\nAccording to the disquotational theory, truth assertions amount to a traversal\nfrom mention to use. On the left of the disquotational biconditional we are\nmerely mentioning the sentence \u201cSnow is white,\u201d because we are talking about\nthis sentence, asserting of it that it has the property of being true, while\non the right we are using the sentence, asserting the propositional content\nthat the sentence expresses. According to this theory of truth, to make a\ntruth assertion\u2014in effect to remove the quotation marks\u2014is to transition from\nmention to use with the same expression.\n\nNot every mention of a sentence need explicitly involve quotation marks, of\ncourse, since I can refer to the first sentence of Moby Dick as I am doing\njust now without actually asking you to call me Ishmael.\n\n####\n\nThe Grelling-Nelson paradox\n\nA word is autological if the word describes itself, if the word itself is or\nhas the property that the word expresses. The standard example is\n\u201cpolysyllabic,\u201d which does indeed have several syllables. Other examples\ninclude \u201cadjectival,\u201d which is indeed an adjective; \u201cunhyphenated\u201d is\nunhyphenated; and \u201cpronounceable\u201d is pronounceable. All these words are\ntherefore autological.\n\nA word is heterological, in contrast, if it fails to describe or hold of\nitself. The word \u201cmonosyllabic\u201d is not monosyllabic; \u201cunwritable\u201d is writable\nand therefore not unwritable; the word \u201cexplosive\u201d is not literally explosive.\nSo these words are heterological.\n\nIs \u201cred\u201d red? Well, that particular copy of the word, written here in this\nchapter, is black, not red, but we could have written the word with red\nink\u2014would that make it red? Which of the following words is autological and\nwhich heterological?\n\nOr is there a category error here? When we talk about a certain word, do we\nmean a particular instance of the word, written on a piece of paper or carved\ninto the brick wall under a bridge, or is it instead an abstraction of all\nthose particular instances of it? The word \u201ccombustible\u201d might seem\ncombustible, if you are reading this book in a format printed on paper, since\nyou could ignite the book (but of course...uh...you would never do\nthat...right?). If you were reading an electronic copy of the book, however,\nor perhaps as I expect in the near future (ha!), reading the copy of my book\nthat is engraved into stone at the Smithsonian, then you would say that it is\nnot combustible.\n\nPerhaps all this confuses type with token, for a given word has many\ninstantiations. There is arguably just one word \u201ctenacious\u201d in the English\nlanguage, even though it could be written many times. If words are indeed\nabstractions in this sense, then it would seem that they have no color at all,\nand so every color name word is colorless. On this view, despite naive\nappearances, what I claim is that even\n\nis heterological, while also\n\nis autological, since the word referred to is an abstraction beyond the color\nused in representing it.\n\nIncidentally, the mental confusion that arises from confusing the meaning of a\nword with the manner of writing it, such as in the color examples above, is\ncalled the Stroop effect, discovered by John Ridley Stroop in the 1930s. Here\nare other kinds of examples:\n\nBut let me finally get to the point with heterologicality. Consider the\nquestion whether \u201cheterological\u201d might be autological or heterological.\n\n> Is \u201cheterological\u201d heterological?\n\nThe question is asking in effect whether the word \u201cheterological\u201d applies to\nitself, and therefore this question, perhaps confusingly, seems to be the same\nas asking:\n\n> Is \u201cheterological\u201d autological?\n\nThe paradox here is that if \u201cheterological\u201d is heterological, then what this\nmeans is that it does not apply to itself, and so it should not be\nheterological. And if it isn't heterological, then \u201cheterological\u201d does not\napply to itself and so it should be heterological. In either case we reach a\ncontradiction. This is known as the Grelling-Nelson paradox, introduced in\n1908 by Kurt Grelling and Leonard Nelson.\n\n####\n\nIterated truth predicates\n\nSuppose that we are considering a mathematical structure M of some kind,\nperhaps a group or a graph or an order of interest. The essential structural\nfeatures of M can be expressed in a formal language associated with the atomic\nstructure of M, a language allowing reference to that structure and the\nquantifiers \u2200x and \u2203x ranging over the domain of individuals of the structure\nM. The features of an order structure, for example, such as transitivity and\nreflexivity, can be expressed in terms of the order relation \u2264 employed in it;\nthe features of a group are expressed in terms of the algebraic group\noperation and the identity element and inverses; the features of a graph are\nexpressed in terms of the adjacency edge relation.\n\nIn any such mathematical context, it is straightforward and unproblematic for\nus to add a truth predicate T(\u03c6) for making truth claims about such an\nassertion \u03c6 in that original language, asserting that it holds in M, even\nallowing the reference of arbitrary individuals from the domain of M. That is,\nwe do not make nested application of the truth predicate T, but rather apply\nit only to assertions in the original language of the structure.\n\nThis is merely the first layer of what will become a very tall hierarchy of\niterated truth predicates. Let us denote the original language of the\nstructure by L_0, and let us use T_0 for the truth predicate we just\nmentioned, fulfilling the disquotational truth scheme\n\nbut only for assertions \u03c6 in the original language L_0. We now form a new\nlarger language L_1 by expanding the original language L_0 of the structure\nwith this truth predicate T_0, which is interpreted in the corresponding\nexpansion of M.\n\nBut the main point is that we can simply do it again, adding another truth\npredicate T_1 for making truth claims in the language L_1. That is, T_1(\u03c8)\nwill hold of any L_1 assertion \u03c8 if and only if \u03c8 holds in M. The predicate\nT_1 in effect enables us to make truth-about-truth assertions, but perhaps it\nis more accurate to say that T_1 makes T_1-truth assertions about assertions\ninvolving T_0-truth. Adding T_1 to the language forms a new larger language\nL_2.\n\nIn this way, we iteratively expand the language with additional truth\npredicates T_n in a sequence of layers. At the bottom level, we have the\ntruth-free assertions of the original language, and each next layer is formed\nby adding a truth predicate for assertions of the previous layers. The\nconstruction proceeds infinitely, even transfinitely, achieving a coherent\nsystem of truth predicates T_\u03b1 for every ordinal \u03b1, each referring to the\ntruth of assertions at lower levels of the hierarchy. Every assertion in the\naccumulating language falls under the truth predicates of higher levels. Such\nis the unproblematic nature of the theory of well-founded iterated truth, the\ncompletely clear gold-standard case for a theory of iterated truth.\n\nAlthough the theory of well-founded iterated truth is precisely designed for\nmaking truth assertions about truth, and truth-about-truth-about-truth and so\non, nevertheless the liar sentence will not arise in this account of iterated\ntruth. At no stage do we achieve a self-applicable truth predicate, a\npredicate T_\u03b1 that applies to assertions in a language including the predicate\nT_\u03b1 itself. Rather, what makes this account well-founded is that each level of\nthe truth predicate T_\u03b1 applies only to assertions in the language L_\u03b1, which\nincludes all earlier truth predicates T_\u03b2 for \u03b2 < \u03b1, but not T_\u03b1 itself.\n\nThe liar sentence, in contrast, is making a claim about the truth not of an\nassertion using only truth predicates from an earlier level of the hierarchy,\nbut rather of an assertion employing the very same truth predicate about which\nthe claim is made.\n\n###\n\nThe no-proposition solution strategy\n\nThese ideas lead to another resolution strategy for the liar paradox. Namely,\nbecause the liar makes a truth assertion about itself, the very same\nassertion, the truth predicate in play is self-applicable in a way that does\nnot and cannot occur with any well-founded truth predicate. The sentence is\ntherefore not meaningful on the basis of the well-founded theory of truth.\nIndeed, because of this self-nesting of the truth predicate, the liar sentence\nis not even syntactically well-formed for well-founded iterated truth\npredicates. What is the theory of truth, then, to which it does refer?\n\nOne way to answer this question is that the paradox itself can be taken as an\nargument that there is no satisfactory theory of truth available for it\u2014the\ncontradiction at the heart of the liar paradox shows that there is no coherent\ntheory of truth in play. And if there is no relevant theory of truth being\nemployed in the liar sentence, then the liar sentence's use of the concept of\ntruth and falsity is groundless, without meaning. In this sense, the liar\nsentence is not meaningful\u2014it does not express a proposition.\n\nThe proposal here is that the liar sentence offers only an illusion of\nmeaning. Perhaps because we are used to making truth assertions and even\ntruth-about-truth assertions in the unproblematic case of the well-founded\niterated theory of truth, the liar sentence conveys a superficial appearance\nof being meaningful. But since ultimately there is no coherent theory of truth\nunderlying the liar usage, the sentence is not actually meaningful. In\nparticular, despite appearances, it does not assert its own falsity.\n\nIs this account subject to the liar's revenge? If we take the liar as not\nmeaningful, then the revenge strategy might call for us to form the sentence:\n\n> This sentence is either false or not meaningful.\n\nThe revenge line of reasoning would then proceed: if we say that this sentence\nlike the liar is not meaningful, then precisely in light of what the sentence\nasserts, it would be true, since we would fulfill the second clause of the\ndisjunction. So it would be meaningful after all.\n\nBut is that analysis correct? Consider the following sentence\n\n> This sentence is either globharbash or not meaningful.\n\nIs this sentence meaningful? Does it express a coherent proposition? I don't\nthink it does. It seems to express a disjunction, but the first clause is\ngibberish and we would seem unable to say exactly what meaning the disjunction\nhas that the sentence asserts. Because of this, I find no coherent proposition\nexpressed here. Nevertheless, one can seem to carry out the revenge analysis\nhere by saying that if the sentence were not meaningful, then the second\ndisjunctive clause would be fulfilled and therefore the sentence would be true\n(and hence meaningful). One can also take that alternatively as an indictment\nof the revenge analysis itself. Since we said that this sentence does not have\na coherent meaning, the fact that the revenge analysis leads us to a wrong\nconclusion tends to pour cold water on the revenge analysis itself.\n\nUltimately, the no-proposition response to the liar regards both the liar\nsentence and the liar's revenge sentence as not expressing propositions. There\nis no meaning to be found in them, despite their superficial appearance as\nexpressing one.\n\nAnd yet, a critic of the position will point out that this solution attempt of\nthe liar amounts to the claim that the liar sentence is not meaningful and\ntherefore, in particular, the claim that it is not true. In short, on this\nview we seem to ascent to the following proposition.\n\n> The liar sentence is not true.\n\nBut now the critics shout in unison: This is exactly what the liar sentence\nitself asserts! This is difficult trouble for the no-proposition position,\nwhich seems to be in the ridiculous position of holding that \u201cthis sentence is\nnot true\u201d is not true, even though that is what the sentence itself appears to\nassert. On the no-proposition account, one must bite the bullet, insisting\nthat the liar sentence \u201cthis sentence is not true\u201d does not express a\nproposition, and so despite appearances it is wrong to say that it expresses\nits own untruth. On this view, the liar sentence doesn't express anything at\nall.\n\n> Lia This sentence is not meaningful.\n>\n> Tru What twaddle nonsense! That sentence has no meaning.\n>\n> Lia But darling, that is what I just said.\n\nWas Lia's statement meaningless or not? The trouble for Tru is that to assert\nthat Lia's sentence is meaningless appears to be the very same sentence she\nasserted. He will have to say, no, Lia, your sentence did not have that\nmeaning, because it had no meaning at all.\n\n####\n\nLiar paradox is a form of Buroli-Forti paradox\n\nConsider the following sentence, which I shall call the well-founded liar's\nrevenge:\n\n> This sentence is not true according to any well-founded theory of truth.\n\nWhat are we saying here? The sentence seems to be saying that it will not be\ndeclared true by any particular truth predicate T_\u03b1 arising in the well-\nfounded hierarchy of iterated truth. Thus, the sentence in effect quanties\nover all the levels T_\u03b1 of the hierarchy of well-founded truth. For this\nreason, the sentence is not expressible in the language L_\u03b1 at any ordinal\nlevel of the hierarchy, since those languages have the predicates T_\u03b2 only for\n\u03b2 < \u03b1. Thus, the sentence is not of the form that could be declared true by\nany predicate T_\u03b1 in the hierarchy. In this sense, we might therefore judge\nthat the proposition asserted by the sentence indeed seems to be the case.\nThis makes the sentence rather similar to the \u201cthis sentence is not obviously\ntrue\u201d case.\n\nPerhaps one is tempted to say that the sentence is true, meaning that it is\ntrue according to a continuation of the hierarchy beyond all the ordinals. We\ncan naturally form the truth predicate T_Ord, after all the ordinals, for\nassertions in the union of the languages L_\u03b1. In this way, the liar paradox is\nrevealed as a form of the Buroli-Forti paradox, the paradox that the class of\nordinals is a transitive well-ordered class of ordinals, but is not itself an\nordinal, since indeed it would be larger than every ordinal\u2014it is a proper\nclass and not a set. The point is that the concept of truth in play for saying\nthat the well-founded liar's revenge is true would similarly be a proper-class\ncontinuation of the hierarchy of truth beyond every ordinal stage.\n\n###\n\nRussell paradox\n\nWe saw in an earlier chapter how Bertrand Russell, with a surprisingly simple\nargument, refuted the general comprehension principle, the principle asserting\nthat every property \u03c6 determines a set, the set of all objects with that\nproperty.\n\nRussell shows that for some properties, this principle is simply inconsistent.\nSpecifically, if the principle were correct we could form the set R of all\nsets x that are not self-membered:\n\nThe problem is that it now follows immediately that R\u2208 R if and only if R \u2209 R,\na contradiction.\n\nThere is a clear parallel with the liar sentence here, for we had observed\nthat R is a member of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself, not\nas the result of an elaborate argument, but rather directly because of the\ndefining property of the Russell set itself.\n\nSimilarly, the Russellian barber shaves all and only those in town who do not\nshave themselves, and so, directly because of this, the barber shaves himself\nif and only if he doesn't. And the barista, who makes coffee for all and only\nthose in town who do not make coffee for themselves, makes coffee for herself\nif and only if she doesn't. In each case, we are defining a certain feature\nthat will hold in a certain case if and only if it doesn't, which is exactly\nthe situation of the liar paradox.\n\n###\n\nBerry's paradox revenge\n\nLet us also recall Berry's number b, defined as the following number:\n\n> The smallest number not definable in fewer than a dozen words.\n\nSince there are only finitely many English expressions using fewer than a\ndozen words, they can define only finitely many numbers, and so it seems that\nthere must be some smallest number not being definable in that manner. The\nparadoxical situation, however, is that this very definition itself uses fewer\nthan a dozen words. Our earlier analysis of Berry's paradox pointed to subtle\ndifficulties in the notion of definability, opening the possibility that some\nexpressions which seem to define numbers might not actually succeed.\n\n####\n\nBerry's revenge\n\nIn light of this, consider now a revenge version of Berry's paradox:\n\n> Let n be the number specified by this definition, plus 1, if the definition\n> succeeds, otherwise 0.\n\nDoes the definition succeed? If it specifies a number n, then because of what\nit says, it should specify n + 1, which would contradict the previous\nspecification. So it seems that the definition cannot succeed. But in this\ncase, it specifies 0 by the default clause. But then it should specify 1, and\ntherefore 2, and so on; around and around we go.\n\nHere is another variant:\n\n> Let B be the smallest number that this definition couldn't possibly define,\n> if there is such a number, otherwise 0.\n\nHas the definition succeeded in specifying a number? If not, then it would\nseem to revert to the default case, and so it would specify 0. So it seems\nthat in any case it should succeed in specifying a number. But if it specifies\na number n, then because of what it says, it should not specify n after all.\nSo it seems there is no number that it can possibly specify. But in this case,\nit should specify 0. Around and around again.\n\n###\n\nThe G\u00f6del sentence\n\nFinally we come now to the G\u00f6del sentence, fruitfully viewed as a provability\nversion of the liar paradox.\n\n> This sentence is not provable.\n\nRemarkably, G\u00f6del explained how such a self-referential sentence can be\nexpressed in the purely mathematical formal language of arithmetic. How\nstrange and wonderful it is. In one respect the formal G\u00f6del sentence asserts\nthat every number has a certain definite numerical property expressed in terms\nof addition and multiplication of that number in combination with smaller\nnumbers, but in another respect the sentence is also naturally interpreted as\nexpressing the nonprovability of the very same statement.\n\nTo specify the G\u00f6del sentence, we fix a particular axiomatic formal system,\nsuch as the axiomatic framework of Peano arithmetic, and then regard\nprovability to mean provability in that formal system. Ultimately, the\nanalysis will lead to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem, one of the most profound\ndevelopments of twentieth-century mathematics, marking the coming of age of\nthe subject of mathematical logic. I should like to provide an accessible soft\naccount of it for the rest of this chapter.\n\n####\n\nArithmetization\n\nOne of G\u00f6del's key insights was the concept of arithmetization, the idea that\nany given finite mathematical structure can be encoded with numbers in such a\nway that the natural combinatorial processes we might employ with it become\narithmetic manipulations on the corresponding numerical codes.\n\nEach of us is familiar, for example, with the fact that when we type our\ndocuments into a computer\u2014perhaps writing the great American novel\u2014the\ninformation is stored ultimately in the computer's memory. While composing the\ndocument, we naturally conceive of it in high-level terms; it consists of\nchapters and paragraphs, perhaps written in certain fonts with certain\nformatting. These components in turn consist of words, and ultimately\nindividual characters, supplemented with control codes for the fonts and\nspacing; ultimately, each atomic piece of information is represented simply by\na number, such as in the extended ASCII system, which has 256 distinct symbols\nand control characters, that is, 2^8, so that each character can be\nrepresented in binary by exactly eight digits of 0 or 1. (Current systems tend\nto be based on Unicode, which allows for a far larger symbol set.) Thus, the\nentire document is represented as a gigantic sequence of 0s and 1s, with each\nbit represented via the presence of low or high voltage, respectively, in\ncertain transistors on the circuit board. In this way, the entire document can\nbe thought of as a single enormous binary number, the G\u00f6del code of the entire\ndocument.\n\nSimilarly, we may undertake arithmetization of other mathematical structures,\nsuch as graphs or finite partials orders or what have you. And indeed, the\nformal language of arithmetic itself amounts to such a combinatorial\nstructure, with the syntax of formal expressions via parse trees and so on.\nEvery assertion \u03c6 in the formal language of arithmetic thus admits a G\u00f6del\ncode \u231c\u03c6\u231d, which is a number representing \u03c6, and all the various syntactic\noperations that we might like to undertake with \u03c6 will be themselves\nexpressible in the language of arithmetic. In this way, the formal language of\narithmetic admits the capacity to make assertions about the formal language of\narithmetic.\n\n####\n\nSelf-reference in arithmetic\n\nUsing arithmetization, let us explore a logical enigma\u2014the fixed-point lemma,\na mathematical mystery, a logical labyrinth that shows how self-reference, the\nstuff of nonsense and confusion, sneaks explicitly into our beautiful number\ntheory. It continually amazes me.\n\nThe fixed-point lemma is the claim that for any assertion \u03c6(x) in the formal\nlanguage of arithmetic, there is a sentence \u03c8 such that in the standard Peano\naxioms of arithmetic one can prove the equivalence\n\nThus, the sentence \u03c8 asserts that \u201c\u03c6 holds of my G\u00f6del code.\u201d\n\nFor those willing to dive into some technical details, let me briefly give the\nproof. Consider the subsitution function, sub, defined so as to return the\nG\u00f6del code after substituting a free variable with a specific numerical value,\nlike this:\n\nwhere the underlined m is the syntactic term 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1, with m many 1s. The\nsub function is a primitive recursive function, representable in the formal\nlanguage of arithmetic. Consider now any formula \u03c6(x) with one free variable\nx. Let\n\nand let\n\nFinally, let\n\nwhich is a sentence in the language of arithmetic. Putting all this together,\nwe observe in Peano arithmetic the following equivalences:\n\nThus, the sentence \u03c8 has the desired fixed-point property as claimed. So every\narithmetically expressible property \u03c6(x) admit a fixed-point sentence \u03c8.\n\n###\n\nFirst incompleteness theorem\n\nLet us now use the G\u00f6del sentence to prove the first incompleteness theorem,\nestablishing that every consistent formal system of arithmetic will admit true\nbut unprovable sentences. In short, arithmetic truth is not the same as\nprovability in any such system.\n\nConsider the G\u00f6del sentence, which asserts its own nonprovability in the\nformal system of Peano arithmetic. If it were provable in that system, then we\ncould formalize that proof and then prove that the proof indeed was a proof.\nIn short, every provable statement is provably provable. But in proving the\nG\u00f6del sentence, however, we would also be proving that it is not provable,\nsince that is precisely what the sentence asserts. So we will have proved both\nthat it is provable and that it is not provable, which would be proving a\ncontradiction. If the theory is consistent, then this is impossible, and so\nthe G\u00f6del sentence cannot be provable.\n\nBut that is precisely what the G\u00f6del sentence asserts! And so the G\u00f6del\nsentence is a true statement that is not provable in the Peano theory.\n\nThis argument generalizes beyond Peano arithmetic to work with any formal\nsystem whose fundamental axioms we can in principle write down. The general\nconclusion is that every consistent arithmetic theory with a computably\nenumerable list of axioms will admit true but unprovable sentences. Indeed,\nthe resulting theory will necessarily be incomplete, admitting statements that\ncan be neither proved nor refuted.\n\nThe success of the G\u00f6del sentence analysis, culminating not in paradox and\nconfusion but rather in those profound mathematical theorems established with\nprecision and rigour, to my way of thinking identifies the problem with the\nliar. The two sentences are fundamentally similar, merely replacing truth with\nproof, but otherwise having exactly the same self-referential form. The\nparadoxical nature of the liar therefore cannot be blamed on that self-\nreferential nature, since this feature is shared by the G\u00f6del sentence.\nRather, the paradox of the liar seems to arise from the theory of truth it\nemploys, a theory that is not spelled out and ultimately perhaps cannot be.\nWhereas the G\u00f6del sentence employs a fully specified and precise notion of\nformal proof, there seems to be no coherent notion of truth underlying the\nliar sentence.\n\n###\n\nTarski's theorem on the nondefinability of truth\n\nNext, let us prove Tarski's remarkable theorem on the nondefinability truth.\nThe theorem asserts that there is no arithmetically expressible property that\npicks out exactly the true arithmetic sentences, that is, a predicate that\nholds exactly of the numerical codes of the true arithmetic assertions. More\nprecisely, there is no arithmetic formula T(y), such that\n\nfor every arithmetic sentence \u03c8. Let us call this the truth scheme for the\npredicate T.\n\nTarski's theorem is an immediate consequence of the fixed-point lemma, by\nusing the liar paradox logic. Namely, if T(y) were arithmetically expressible,\nthen we may consider the formula \u00acT(x), which must admit a fixed point \u03c8, so\nthat\n\nBut this equivalence means that \u03c8 asserts its own untruth with respect to T, a\nform of the liar sentence, and consequently\n\nwhich would prevent T from fulfilling the truth scheme. So there can be no\nsuch expressible truth predicate.\n\n####\n\nAlternative proof via Russell\n\nI should like also to give an alternative proof of Tarski's theorem that\navoids the fixed-point lemma, by appealing directly to the central idea of the\nRussell paradox, and without the need for much arithmetization, beyond the\nidea that every formal assertion \u03c6 is represented by a numerical code \u231c\u03c6\u231d. The\nclaim will be that there is no arithmetically expressible formula T that\nexpresses what it means for a formula \u03c6(x) to be true at its argument x, like\nthis:\n\nSo this is a parametric version of Tarski's theorem.\n\nSuppose toward contradiction that there were such a truth predicate T. Using\nthis predicate, let R(x) = \u00acT(x,x), which is the formula expressing, \u201cit is\nnot the case that x is a formula that is true of itself.\u201d Let r = \u231cR\u231d, and\nconsider the sentence R(r), which asserts \u00acT(r,r), which is \u00acT(\u231cR\u231d,r), which\nby the truth-predicate requirement is equivalent to \u00acR(r), a contradiction.\nThat's it. So there can be no arithmetically expressible account of truth.\n\nIn effect, the formula R(x) expresses that x is the code of a heterological\nformula:\n\nThe point is that in the context here of a formal language, the notion of\nheterologicality becomes a completely rigorous mathematical definition.\nNamely, a formula \u03c6(x) in the language of arithmetic is heterological if\n\u00ac\u03c6(\u231c\u03c6\u231d). Our proof of Tarski's theorem via Russell amounts to exactly the same\nlogic of the Grelling-Nelson paradox of heterologicality, except that here it\nis about precise assertions in the formal language of arithmetic. Thus we are\nled to a fundamental unity of all these paradoxes.\n\n####\n\nThe infinite G\u00f6del sentences\n\nLet us consider the G\u00f6delian version of the infinite liar, a provability\nversion of the Visser-Yablo paradox.\n\nWe can formalize this more precisely with the fixed-point lemma, to find a\nformula \u03b3(k) in one free variable that asserts the nonprovability of all later\nsentences.\n\nIf any specific instance \u03b3(k) were provable, then we will have proved that no\nlater instance \u03b3(n) is provable. But every such later instance \u03b3(n) makes a\nweaker claim than \u03b3(k) itself, since every number above n is also above k, and\nso in proving \u03b3(k) we are also able to prove \u03b3(n). So we can prove that \u03b3(n)\nis provable and also prove that \u03b3(n) is not provable, which is impossible if\nthe theory is consistent. Thus, no specific instance \u03b3(k) can be provable. And\nso in virtue of what they assert, these are all true but unprovable sentences.\n\n###\n\nThe speed-up phenomenon for lengths of proof\n\nConsider the following sentence, a hybrid of the G\u00f6del sentence with Berry's\nparadox.\n\n> This sentence is not provable in Peano arithmetic with a proof using fewer\n> than a billion symbols.\n\nRemarkable as it may seem, we can express such a sentence in the formal\nlanguage of arithmetic by using the usual fixed-point tricks as with the G\u00f6del\nsentence. That is, there is a formal assertion \u03b2 in the language of arithmetic\nthat expresses the fact that the very sentence itself is not provable by a\nformal proof in that language using fewer than one billion symbols.\n\nIs it true? Well, if it were provable using fewer than one billion symbols,\nthen we would be able to prove that that proof was a proof with fewer than one\nbillion symbols (this proof that it is such a proof might be longer, but this\nis no matter). But then we will have proved that the sentence is false. So we\nwill have proved the sentence and its negation, which would mean that our\naxioms are inconsistent. So if the axioms are consistent, then indeed the\nsentence is not provable using fewer then one billion symbols. And so the\nsentence \u03b2 is true.\n\nIndeed, though, the sentence is also provable, since we can verify that none\nof the proofs using fewer than one billion symbols is a proof of this\nsentence. That is a very long proof. What we have, in short, is a sentence\nthat is true and provable, but necessarily, every proof of it is very long.\nMeanwhile, if we assume the consistency of the theory, then we have a very\nshort proof.\n\nThis situation provides a simple proof of the second incompleteness theorem!\nLet me explain.\n\n###\n\nThe second incompleteness theorem\n\nThe second incompleteness theorem is the assertion that no consistent theory\nof arithmetic with a computable set of axioms extending some basic axioms can\nprove its own consistency. For example, the theory of Peano arithmetic, if\nconsistent, does not prove itself consistent.\n\nLet me give a self-contained proof of this using the simple ideas from the\nspeed-up phenomenon we just discussed. Suppose toward contradiction that PA\nproves its own consistency. This proof has some size, and let N be much\nlarger, but with a small description, such as the exponential of the proof\nsize. Consider the corresponding G\u00f6del-Berry hybrid sentence \u03b2 asserting that\nit has no proof of size less than N. The speedup analysis shows both that \u03b2\nhas no proof in PA of size less than N, but it does have a very short proof in\nPA + Con(PA). Since PA proves Con(PA) in much less than size N, we can combine\nthat proof with the proof of \u03b2 in PA + Con(PA) and still have a proof of size\nless than N. So PA does admit a short proof of \u03b2, after all, a contradiction.\nTherefore PA does not prove its own consistency, which establishes the second\nincompleteness theorem.\n\nThe argument adapts to whatever other sufficient theory you want to use\ninstead of Peano arithmetic.\n\n###\n\nThe truth-teller and L\u00f6b's theorem\n\nIf the Liar sentence asserts its own falsity, let us consider the truth-teller\nsentence, which asserts its own truth.\n\n> This sentence is true.\n\nIs it true?\n\nPerhaps you think it can be either true or false, but I shall have something\nmore to say about that momentarily. Meanwhile, just as the G\u00f6del sentence\nasserts its own unprovability, let us also consider the L\u00f6b sentence,\nasserting its own provability.\n\n> This sentence is provable.\n\nSo we have four sentences forming a two-dimensional symmetric array:\n\nMany people undertake the analysis of the Liar sentence by arguing that if the\nLiar sentence is true, then it must be false; and if it is false, then it must\nbe true. And so, they conclude, the sentence is paradoxical. Meanwhile, the\ncorresponding analysis of the truth-teller sentence seems to go nowhere: if it\nis true, then it is true; and if it is false, then it is false. Sometimes\npeople conclude from this that the truth-teller sentence could be either true\nor false; it is somehow not determined.\n\nBut that analysis is not actually a proof of the claim; just because one does\nnot immediately find a contradiction does not mean that there is not a deeper\nconclusion to be made. It is like saying that you searched for the keys and\ndid not find them, therefore, they could be anywhere! But they are actually in\na specific place, and they probably could not be on the Moon or inside Grant's\nTomb. Can the truth-teller really be either true or false?\n\nIf you think so, and this is my main point here, then perhaps you might be\ninclined to expect a similar situation for the L\u00f6b sentence. But that\nconclusion would be wrong in light of L\u00f6b's theorem, which shows, remarkably,\nthat the L\u00f6b sentence, the sentence asserting its own provability, is actually\nprovable. The L\u00f6b sentence is provable and therefore true.\n\nLet me sketch a soft proof. Let \u03bb be the L\u00f6b sentence, and by the fixed-point\nlemma, let \u03c3 be a sentence that asserts the implication, that if \u03c3 is\nprovable, then \u03bb holds.\n\nSuppose that \u03c3 were provable. Then we could prove that \u03c3 is provable, and\nbecause the biconditional above is provable, we would therefore be able to\nprove that \u03bb is provable. But this is provably equivalent to \u03bb. And so we have\nargued: if \u03c3 is provable, then \u03bb is true. But that is just what \u03c3 asserts, and\nso by formalizing our argument, we see that \u03c3 is in fact provable. And so it\nis provably provable, and so \u03bb is provable. Thus, the L\u00f6b sentence is true.\n\nIn short, the sentence asserting \u201cthis sentence is provable\u201d is in fact\nprovable. That is fascinating and surprising. But moreover, I should like to\ntake this fact as a warning for us not to be too quick in our analysis of the\nsentence, \u201cthis sentence is true.\u201d\n\n####\n\nThe infinite truth-teller and infinite L\u00f6b sentences\n\nConsider finally the infinite truth-teller sentences:\n\nAnd similarly the infinite L\u00f6b sentences:\n\nLet me argue for these latter sentences as in L\u00f6b's theorem that they are in\nfact provable. We construct the sentences by the fixed-point lemma, finding\nsentences \u03c4(k) that assert the provability of all \u03c4(n) for n>k.\n\nTo see that this is in fact true, apply the fixed-point lemma again to find a\nsentence \u03c3 asserting\n\nNow, we argue as in L\u00f6b's theorem. If \u03c3 were provable, then it would be\nprovably provable, and from that, using the previous characterization of \u03c3 as\nthe implication on the right-hand side, it would follow that \u03c4(0) is provable.\nUsing this defining characterization of \u03c4(0), we would therefore be able to\nprove that every \u03c4(n) for n > 0 is provable, and using the other direction of\nthat biconditional, we could prove every \u03c4(n) for n > 0\\. Thus, each \u03c4(n)\nwould be not merely provable, but true. So we have argued that if \u03c3 is\nprovable, then \u03c4(0) holds. But this implication is just what \u03c3 asserts, and so\nwe have now actually proved \u03c3. And so \u03c4(0) is true. And this implies all later\n\u03c4(n), since the scope of the quantifier is descending.\n\nShare\n\nGive a gift subscription\n\n###\n\nQuestions for further thought\n\n  1.
