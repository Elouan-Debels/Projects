As described by\nTodd in 1955, Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) denotes a series of\nparoxysmal disorders of the body schema (essential symptoms of AIWS), which\nmay be correlated to phenomena of depersonalization, visual illusions and\nalterations in the perception of time (2, 3). Giorgio De Chirico did not know\nthat he was suffering from the AIWS, although, in \u201cMemoirs of my Life,\u201d he\nwrites of being suffering from abdominal pain and speaks of \u201ccolic saturnine,\u201d\nreferring to Renaissance theory according to which genes are born under the\nsign of Saturn. Moreover, in a short writing dedicated to Carlo Carr\u00e0, De\nChirico recounts the experience of headache through a \u201clucid dream\u201d: \u201cI sleep.\nI'm wearing a diver's helmet. The throbbing of my brain splits into many\nbubbles on the lacquered platform of my seventh ceiling.\u201d\n\nIn order to Chirico's migraine aura as cause of his inspiration, Nicola and\nPodoll have examined his works as painter and writer, including his \u201cMemoirs,\u201d\nthe autobiographical novels \u201cHebdomeros\u201d and \u201cMister Dudron\u201d and his collected\nessays. Migraine aura symptoms were found by reading clinical descriptions of\nsuch disorders, but also observing the paintings and designs from the Migraine\nArt collection which currently consists of 562 pieces (4).\n\nMigraine symptoms found in Giorgio de Chirico's writings were the following:\nheadache, nausea, photophobia, abdominal pain as autonomic symptoms, scotoma\n(visual field stain), visual, and gustatory hallucinations, described as\nspiritual fevers, autokinesis (apparent movement of fixed objects), recurrent\ndreams, macropsias, micropsias (see objects larger or smaller than normal),\ntelopsias (see objects as very far away), depersonalization syndrome, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\nor jamais vu phenomena. Using the DSM-IV methodology Vanni et al. stated that\nDe Chirico suffered from a personality disorder with narcissistic and paranoid\ntraits and had suffered from somatization disorders in a period between 1909\nand 1918 (5). Psychiatric disorders have long been studied. Personality\ndisorders, anxiety, depression, dissociative disorders do not manifest with\nwarning signs such as auras. They are structured disorders, with well-defined\ncharacteristics. For example, depression can have, as symptoms, crying crises,\nchanges in sleep, loss of pleasure. Psychosis can manifest hallucinations, but\nthese are symptoms and not auras (4). Blanke about some symptoms that De\nChirico described, affirms these are encountered in patients with temporal\nlobe epilepsy, suggesting, they rather have related to temporal lobe epilepsy\nthan migraine (6). Temporal lobe epilepsy includes physical and psychic\nsymptoms. More than 90% of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy report an\nepigastric aura. Other autonomic symptoms, psychic symptoms, and certain\nsensory phenomena (such as olfactory) also occur. Headache is not reported.\nThe duration of complex partial seizures is generally >1 min, while\nsomatosensory and visual auras are highly unlikely with temporal lobe epilepsy\n(7). There is a long discussion about the origin of De Chirico's disorders:\nepilepsy, psychiatric disorders or migraine? Although some of the symptoms may\nbe related to temporal lobe epilepsy or some forms of psychosis (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nphenomenon), or epigastric pain crises, visual aura as in migraine, it is also\ntrue that from the painter's autobiography as from the various biographies,\nthe reported symptoms, especially for durability and morphology\n(metamorphopsias) are more compatible with the aura of AIWS (4, 7). In short,\nthe key to reading De Chirico's disorder is in migraine with visual-somal-\nsensory aura. typical of AIWS. From the pictorial works it is deduced that the\naura of the artist was different from the epileptic aura, especially for the\nlongest duration and for the alterations of things, figures, people, and more,\ncharacteristics of AIWS (7). The confirmation is given by the pictorial works:\nthe telopsia-macropsia in Piazza d' Italia, 1913, or the metamorphopsia in the\nseries of mannequins. In Piazza d' Italia there is a long perspective where\nsome people are very small compared to tall colonnaded buildings, while the\nmannequins have an oval shaped head, without eyes, ears, mouth, representing a\nvisual depersonalization.\n\nDe Chirico's autobiography and essays as well as his first metaphysical\npainting (The Enigma of an Autumn Afternoon, 1909) are the proof that migraine\nvisual aura phenomena, associated to paramnesias (jamais and d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu) could be\ninterpreted as the start of the painter's creative process (4). The link\nbetween migraine and AIWS, hypothesized by Todd (1), is the most reported in\nthe literature and is the line mainly considered in the framing of the\nsyndrome. The information available to date is supported by data derived from\nthe use of techniques of transcranial magnetic stimulation and neuroimaging.\nHamed, referring to a case of coincidence between migraine and AIWS, states\nthe implication of the occipital lobe and the parietal lobe (8). This data is\nconfirmed by the study of Brumm et al. who first recorded the cerebral\nactivity of a patient with the syndrome, during an attack of micropsia. Using\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which allows the activity of\ncortical areas to be described on the basis of blood flow detection, the\nauthors have detected abnormal activation of the occipital lobe, in the\nprimary regions and in the extrastriatal parts of visual cortical areas, and\nof the parietal lobe (9). The results are also in agreement with what was\nclaimed by Cau on the possibility of the manifestation of perceptual\nalterations, such as those present in AIWS, in the case of temporal-occipital\nand parieto-occipito-temporal lesions, emphasizing the role of these areas in\nthe formation of perceptions (10).\n\nGo to:\n\n## The man and the artist, the double\n\nThe concept of the double has attracted the attention of scientists. A\ndocumentary film by Daniel M\u00fcller, \u201cThe Second Body\u201d (2003) includes a\nsequence about Giorgio de Chirico's double as represented in his self-portrait\n(with shadow) from 1920. The white shape of a life-sized human body with the\ncharacteristic profile of De Chirico's head is pictured back to the artist's\nphysical body, represented in full color and details. The white human-shaped\nfigure is located behind the artist's head, which excludes an interpretation\nin terms of view of own mirror image (autoscopy) or seeing one's double, but\nrather indicates an out-out-body experience(OBE) with the somesthetic\nsensation of a double body with an extracampine localization behind the\nphysical body (8). The apparent union of the own physical body and his\nduplicate body suggests that De Chirico has pictured the process of either\nseparation or return of the parasomatic body from or to the physical body,\nrespectively. Out-of-body experience, which may occur as a migraine aura\nsymptom, complies with interpretation of the artist's self-portrait with\nshadow. Thus, Wieland Schmied wrote: \u201cBehind the artist in his dark jacket a\nbright, almost white shadow turns away. It is as if his alter ego detached\nitself from him, as if a part of his self-left him\u201d (11). Fagiolo dell'Arco\ngave the following interpretation: \u201cThe most surprising peculiarity consists\nof the white shadow which detaches itself from his body and looks outwards,\ntransforming into an animistic double\u201d (12). In essay \u201cMetaphysical art and\noccult sciences,\u201d the painter has referred to \u201cthe fact of considering the\npossibility of existence of immaterial forms, of imagining a double of\nours...made up of fluids and of incorporeal substances\u201d. \u201cMetaphysical\npainting\u201d means an art that uses the technical tools typical of painting\n(perspective, chiaroscuro, color) to represent something that goes beyond\nsensory experience, leaving room for dreams and visions fruit of the\nunconscious. In the metaphysical painting also the places, however realistic,\nassume a dreamlike value because of a distorted perspective, of elements\napparently out of place (statues, mannequins) and of unnatural colors (13).\nSuggestive elements of De Chirico's metaphysical works are the immense squares\nwithout human presence where bizarre elements emerge such as mannequins,\nmarble busts, and classic columns. These paintings reveal a sense of\nloneliness and restlessness, as if one lived in a strange dream (14). It is a\nparticular disorder that leads those who suffer to have a visual perception\nbizarre, just as happened to Alice after entering the lair of the Rabbit:\nparts of the body that seem to become enormous, rooms of the house that\nshrink, Toys that take the size of buses (10).\n\nThis particular syndrome is a real neurological disorder, which suddenly\nappears in patients who suffer and generally disappears after various periods,\nwhich can last from months to years.\n\nGo to:\n\n## Conclusions\n\nGiorgio De Chirico suffered unquestionably from AIWS. Techniques of\nneuroimaging offered a valid apport to knowledge of anatomical and functional\naspects about the syndrome. Generally parietooccipital brain lobes and\nparticularly temporoparietal-occipital carrefour (TPO-C) are supposed as\nregions for developing many of AIWS symptoms. AIWS symptoms depend on an\nalteration of TPO-C where visual-spatial and somatosensory information are\nintegrated. Alterations in these brain regions may cause dysmetropsias and\ndisorders of body schema. Clinical symptoms, together with neuroimaging,\nconfirm what has been said. De Chirico's aura was not an epileptic aura, nor a\npsychiatric aura. It was a visual -somesthetic aura, in the context of a\nmigraine. These considerations are reflected in the data of the literature, in\nthe autobiographies, biographies, and various writings, concerning the artist.\nIt is really extraordinary to think that a neurological disorder can generate\nsuch wonders. Therefore, it is the case to say \u201cwhen neurology creates art.\u201d\n\nGo to:\n\n## Author contributions\n\nPC provided to prepare manuscript. RM provided to elaborate manuscript.
