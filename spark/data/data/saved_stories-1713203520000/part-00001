A\nbacklog filled with our users hopes, problems, desires, and in some cases,\ntheir social security numbers. It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to\nthat backlog as we transition ourselves from a Product CompanyTM to an AI\nCompanyTM.\n\nFor the past six months, and for the foreseeable future, we have been working\ntirelessly on adding GenAI features to our product that no one asked for.\nToday, we\u2019re excited to announce the beta release of the alpha build of these\nfeatures! This release represents a new paradigm for our product: instead of\noffering a purpose-built, interactive experience, you\u2019ll instead communicate\nwith our product using Natural LanguageTM.\n\nNatural LanguageTM replaces the decades worth of useless user interface design\nguidelines with a simple text box. Merely type in an extremely detailed list\nof requirements and context, and like magic, our GenAITM features will perform\nyour actions to the best of the Internet\u2019s ability.\n\nWe\u2019re very excited for you to see how much more effective we think these\nfeatures will make you. You\u2019ll clearly understand that the $10/month/user\nincrease represents a small fraction of the business value youll receive. And\nbest of all, by using GenAITM tools like this, you too will become an AI\nCompanyTM , just like us.\n\n## FAQ\n\nWhat\u2019s the status of the enhancement request that our purchase was predicated\non?\n\nWe encourage customers to reach out to our customer success team to learn more\nabout how our GenAITM features make enhancement requests irrelevant!\n\nWhen did you decide to become an AI Company?\n\nEver since our companies inception actually! We only created successful\nsoftware as a way to fund our GenAITM efforts. You can see from our recently\nmodified and published blog posts that GenAITM is baked deep within our DNA!\n\nWait you\u2019re increasing every subscription by $10/user? For this?\n\nAI means Ain\u2019t Inexpensive. With the added costs from adding the text box to\nour app, as well as the exorbitant premium we pay to a different company\neverytime someone uses the text box, we\u2019ll be lucky if we don\u2019t raise the\nsubscription again in a few months.\n\n  * \u2190Previous\n  * Next\u2192\n\n\u00a9 2024 Candid Development LLCAll Rights Reserved\n\n", "frontpage": false}
