Finding new ways to acquire and onboard\ncustomers and get them to value as fast as possible. Some will work, others\nwon\u2019t. Today we\u2019re writing about the latter.\n\nAbout how we explored the potential of Reddit, specifically the\n/dataisbeautiful channel, as a growth channel for Rows. Why we did it, what\nhappened, and why it stopped.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\n## Why Reddit and /dataisbeautiful?\n\nUsing Reddit as an organic growth channel had been considered before, but the\ndecisive moment was a customer suggestion. During an otherwise very vanilla\ncall, a customer mentioned:\n\n\u201cRows has beautiful charts. Have you thought about sharing examples of your\ncharts on the /dataisbeautiful subreddit?\u201d\n\nWe had. Sort of.\n\n/r/dataisbeautiful is the underworld for data visualization nerds like us.\nWith 21 million members, it is the 32nd most popular subreddit. You can find\nall types of charts and other visualizations, with new ones coming every\nminute.\n\nOur charts are indeed one of our distinctive features. Behind every chart,\nthere\u2019s a table, and very often a spreadsheet. It was a natural testing ground\nfor a new growth experiment:\n\nCan we drive traffic to rows.com by consistently posting charts made in Rows\nin the /dataisbeautiful subreddit?\n\nOur approach was straightforward:\n\n  * Selecting engaging topics: We focused on relevant, debatable, or counterintuitive topics to spark conversations and debates.\n\n  * Data gathering and visualization: Using public data, we created spreadsheets and charts to visually represent the information.\n\n  * Sharing mechanics: We published the spreadsheets on rows.com/community, shared PNGs of the charts on the /dataisbeautiful channel with a watermark linking back to Rows, and commented with the original data sources and Rows spreadsheet.\n\nDuring 97 days, we posted 43 charts on two of our personal Reddit accounts.\n\nOne of the most popular posts\n\n## The Metrics\n\nTo measure the experiment's success, we focused on these metrics:\n\n  * Reddit Engagement: Views and shares of our posts.\n\n  * Website Traffic: Visitors and page views to rows.com from Reddit.\n\n  * Search Traffic: Daily search traffic to Rows.com, focusing on spikes correlated with Reddit posting days to measure indirect traffic from the Reddit audience.\n\n  * Conversion via spreadsheets: Views and duplicates of the actual spreadsheets hosting the charts.\n\n## The Outcomes\n\nTable with the overview stats of the experiment\n\nOur Reddit experiment yielded fascinating results:\n\nHigh Visibility\n\nWe posted 43 charts, with a total of 14.6 million views. The median views per\npost was 32k, with an average of 339k views. That\u2019s a lot of views! Some ,\nlike this one about aid sources of aid to Ukraine, went viral, with >3 million\nviews.\n\n(Plus, our individual Post Karma on Reddit went from 0 to >9k.)\n\nDirect Traffic Boost\n\nThe initiative directed 1,052 users to Rows, resulting in 3,021 page views,\ncorrelating with our most-viewed Reddit posts.\n\nThere was no clear increase in direct search traffic to Rows.com. Traffic from\nqueries containing \u2018rows\u2019 shows the same weekly pattern before, during, and\nafter the Reddit posts.\n\nConversion via spreadsheets\n\nThe spreadsheets had 1,359 views and 12 duplicates, resulting in 42 direct\nsignups from the public spreadsheet \u201cSign up\u201d CTA.\n\nOn average, it took 12.4k Reddit views to generate a view of the underlying\nspreadsheet, with significant variance across posts.\n\nDespite impressive metrics, the impact on user acquisition was less than we\nhoped.\n\n## Wrap up\n\nThe Reddit experiment was popular within Reddit but fell short in direct user\nacquisition. At ~1 sign-up per post, it wasn't worth the effort. I\u2019m still\nglad we did it.\n\nWe came away with a few important learnings:\n\n  * You can quickly gain followers on Reddit and get eyeballs on your content by posting unique and engaging content.\n\n  * Unlike Twitter, converting Reddit virality into product adoption is difficult, especially in subreddits like /dataisbeautiful where there's no direct link between the shared content and the product website.\n\n  * If I could redo the experiment, I would have used Reddit Ads on the subreddits feed to blend brand awareness from organic posts with conversion-focused ads.\n\n  * Uploading a PNG file doesn't showcase one of our most beloved features - Embeds.\n\nAnd one to-do:\n\n  * Keep investing in Charts. We received a lot of feedback from the Reddit community, including requests for new chart types, feedback on data label positions, and data series colors. Our Charts, with footnotes and AI-generated subtitles, are a strong differentiator, but we\u2019re committed to making them 10x better.\n\nNext time, we\u2019ll write about the time we turned our mobile website into a\nTiktok-like experience.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet, head out to rows.com and see what the future of\nspreadsheets (and charts) looks like.\n\nNext\n\n10 Best Google Sheets Alternatives to Try in 2024\n\nIn this article we are going to review the best Google Sheets alternatives you\ncan use in 2024.\n\n\ud83c\udf6a\n\nWe use cookies to enhance your user experience and analyze website\nperformance.
