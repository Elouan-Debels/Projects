Ultimately, we said a more nuanced approach is\nnecessary that takes elements from both approaches to provide a comprehensive\nsecurity approach to securing modern environments. Over the past two years, we\nhave talked to hundreds of organizations and compiled a number of case studies\nthat highlight some of the growing costs associated with agentless scans when\nit comes to performing vulnerability assessments in cloud environments. This\narticle examines a critical case study in agentless snapshot management for\none of the largest social media giants in the world in the hopes of bringing\nto light some of the unseen costs of agentless security scans and encouraging\ncompanies to forge a better path forward that better balances efficiencies in\nthe vulnerability detection process with financial viability in the cloud.\n\nAgentless scans conduct security assessments without installing software\nagents on target systems, offering simplified deployment. However, they may\nhave limited visibility into certain system aspects and rely on network\nconnectivity, potentially impacting performance. Despite these limitations,\nagentless scanning remains valuable, especially in environments where agent\ndeployment is impractical.\n\nThese solutions offer convenience in deployment but beyond that?\n\nAs these solutions rely on scanning snapshots, the snapshots need to be stored\nsomewhere i.e. either in the customer's cloud or the vendors.\n\nWhile agentless scans are crucial for vulnerability detection, their costs can\nescalate rapidly, particularly in expansive cloud environments. However, it's\nthe overlooked snapshot expenses that pose a more insidious threat to\nfinancial sustainability.\n\nIf snapshots are stored in the vendor's cloud, organizations risk hemorrhaging\nmore funds per scan than they save. Conversely, storing snapshots in the\ncustomer's cloud can lead to astronomical operational costs.\n\n## Case Studies on Agentless Scan Costs\n\nTake, for instance, the case of a social media giant with over 200,000 Compute\ninstances. The strain on their financial resources is so acute that\nimplementing full logging for services becomes a luxury, further compromising\nsecurity measures.\n\nTo see the snapshot cost in detail, let us take an EBS volume of 100GB\nattached to an EC2 instance. Further, let us also assume the same thumb rule\nused in data backups; i.e., 3% of the data in an EBS volume changes every day.\nUsing these two assumptions and a cost of $0.05 / GB for snapshots, the total\ncost of the snapshot is $9.50 for each month. Note that this cost will change\ndepending on the size of the actual EBS volume used. For example, if we have\nan EBS volume of size 200GB attached to an EC2 instance, the total cost of the\nsnapshot becomes $19 for each month.\n\nIn addition, assuming a minimum of 90-day retention period for the snapshots,\nthe cost of snapshot for a 100GB EBS volume is $28.50, and $57 for a 200GB EBS\nvolume.\n\nIf we use the data above, for an enterprise that has a 100GB EBS volume\nattached to each of their 10,000 EC2 instances, the total snapshot cost is at\nleast $285,000, and for 200GB EBS volumes, it is at least $570,000.\n\n## Unsustainable Costs Across Industries\n\nFor a leading social media giant that has a 100GB EBS volume attached to each\nof their 200,000 EC2 instances, the total snapshot cost is at least $5.7M and\nfor 200GB EBS volumes it is at least $11.4M.\n\nThis social media organization is not alone, organizations across industries\nin entertainment streaming, financial services software, restaurants and\ncomputer manufacturing all have to struggle with the complexity of managing\nthese security scans in the cloud. Examples include the following data points:\n\n  * Consider a video streaming service, one of the largest users of S3 buckets. The financial strain on their resources is dire, making the issue of snapshot expenses even more pressing.\n\n  * One of the largest financial software companies globally, maintaining over 100,000 EC2 instances, 6 million-plus Lambdas, and thousands of user accounts, faces significant challenges in managing snapshot costs. The sheer scale of their cloud infrastructure magnifies the financial strain, challenging their ability to balance security and budgetary concerns effectively.\n\nAdding to the complexity, while snapshot-based scans are easier to deploy,\nthey often lack context, resulting in noisy and non-actionable results.\nOrganizations are left footing astronomical operational costs for scan results\nthat fail to provide the necessary actionable insights to enhance security\nposture effectively.\n\n  * A fast food restaurant chain encounters 70,000 vulnerabilities every time they scan!\n  * One of the largest providers of insurance in the world grapples with 100,000 vulnerabilities.\n  * One of the largest computer manufacturers in the world faced 40,000 vulnerabilities, ultimately deciding to move away from these solutions.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nIn navigating these challenges, organizations must strike a delicate balance\nbetween security, operational efficiency, and financial viability. The path to\ncloud security entails not only mitigating known risks but also shedding light\non hidden financial burdens, ensuring a sustainable approach to safeguarding\ncloud environments across industries.\n\nIf you would like to go into more detail on the above use cases or learn more\nabout the organizational case studies outlined in this article, please\nschedule a demo with Deepfence, and we will be happy to review with you.\n\n## Latest posts\n\nBrowse all posts\n\nPress Release\n\nMarch 21, 2024\n\n### Deepfence Streamlines Remediation for Real-Time Cloud Native Application\nProtection in the Enterprise\n\nRead more\n\nRuntime Security\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\n### Runtime Context: What is it and Why is it Critical to Your Cloud Security?\n\nRead more\n\nGet DeepfenceBook a Demo\n\nSubscribe for updates\n\nProducts\n\n  * Deepfence Products\n  * ThreatMapper - Open Source\n  * ThreatStryker - Enterprise\n  * Compare Products\n\nSolutions\n\n  * Deepfence Solutions\n  * Open Source Solutions\n  * Workload Protection\n  * Security Observability\n  * Vulnerability Management\n  * Compliance\n  * Secure Kubernetes\n  * Secure Serverless\n  * Secure Containers\n  * Secure Clouds\n\nWhy Deepfence?\n\n  * Who Uses Deepfence?\n  * Why Deepfence?\n  * Why CNAPP?\n  * Detection and Response\n  * Contextual Security\n  * SOC2 Certification\n\nGet Deepfence\n\nResources\n\n  * Community\n  * Resource Library\n  * Documentation\n  * Training\n  * Support\n  * Blog\n  * News\n  * Careers\n  * About Deepfence\n  * Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 2024 Deepfence, Inc. | Privacy Policy\n\n", "frontpage": false}
