Mozilla Firefox is Bringing in Tab Grouping Feature\n\nMozilla Firefox should gear up as an excellent option for power users and\nproductivity enthusiasts with this feature.\n\n, and Sourav Rudra\n\nMarch 11, 2024 . 4:46 PM\n\n3 min read\n\n  * Share on Twitter\n\n  * Share on Facebook\n\n  * Share on Pinterest\n\n  * Share on LinkedIn\n\n  * Share on WhatsApp\n  * Share via Email\n\nMozilla has been making many waves recently, the latest of which were the\nlayoffs aimed at streamlining efforts into their core offering, the Firefox\nweb browser, after a new CEO, Laura Chambers, took over.\n\nAt the time, the plan was to re-direct resources towards Firefox and to work\non AI integration. But, with a recent development, a long-requested feature\nhas taken the center stage with a renewed effort that may finally see it being\noffered with Firefox.\n\nAnd, seems like, we have to thank the new CEO for this development.\n\nLet's check out what's going on.\n\nWhat's Happening: All of this started back in July 2023, when Ethan Word\nposted asking if a \u201cTab Groups\u201d feature would ever come to Firefox, similar to\nwhat Chrome has. Back then, many agreed that they would also prefer having\nsuch a useful feature, and that using extensions to get similar functionality\nwas not really a viable solution.\n\n\ud83d\udccb\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Tab Groups is a neat feature that lets users easily\ngroup tabs by category, or whatever they'd like for easy tab management.\n\nA few months passed by, and that is when a community member, BelFox took it\nupon themselves to get the ball rolling again.\n\nThey tagged the new CEO of Mozilla, and made a very convincing plea that\nincluded how community members have spread the good word about Firefox for\nmore than a decade, and that they wanted to see it succeed.\n\nBelFox went on to strengthen their case by mentioning the most requested\nfeature on the Mozilla Connect portal that has been there since 2022! The\nrequest was to implement a native tab grouping feature or a more customizable\ntoolbar into Firefox.\n\nSee for yourself, it has almost 3,000 votes now. \ud83d\udc47\n\nBelFox also mentioned that:\n\n> Please let Firefox grow by providing useful features like these, not (only)\n> by inserting AI into the browser. Community will love this and will help\n> boost Firefox\u2019s adoption numbers.\n\nAnd I agree, focusing just on AI won't do Firefox any good if there are no\nother useful features such as tab grouping. Interestingly, the CEO of Mozilla,\nLaura Chambers replied! \ud83d\ude2e\n\nShe said that the development team has made adding a tab grouping feature to\nFirefox a priority, and that people are now assigned to work on it. She also\nnoted all the other insights shared by community members on the forum.\n\nDoes it Matter?\n\nIt does. You see, competing browsers like Chrome, Vivaldi, Edge etc. already\noffer tab grouping, and a popular browser like Firefox not having such a handy\nfeature doesn't bode well.\n\nThe majority of users prefer using a web browser where they find familiarity,\nand, of course, plenty of useful features that improve their web browsing\nexperience and boost productivity.\n\nEven though there are plenty of extensions in the market such as Simple Tab\nGroups and Sidebery, a native experience almost always tops third-party\nsolutions like those.\n\nInterestingly, this is not Mozilla's first attempt at providing Tab Groups. In\nan earlier version of Firefox, there was a feature on Firefox called\n\u201cPanorama\u201d which was ahead of its time if you ask me.\n\nIt provided a unique tab grouping experience that was very intuitive to work\naround; the demo above shows it in its full glory.\n\nSadly, Mozilla ditched it entirely. As noted by another Mozilla community\nmember, that work was converted into a Firefox add-on called Tab Groups by\nQuickSaver, that also found its demise a few years after.\n\nHowever, things are finally looking up.\n\nWhen to Expect: At the time of writing, there was no concrete release date for\nwhen tab grouping would debut on Firefox.\n\nBut, this renewed push should take some time to materialize as implementing\nsuch a feature requires significant effort; more so if done from scratch.\n\nIt is still better to have a confirmation rather than having none, so users\nwill have to wait a little more before they can take advantage of Tab Groups\nin Firefox.\n\n\ud83d\udcac What do you think? Will tab grouping be a good addition to Firefox?\n\nVia: DebugPoint NEWS\n\n## More from It's FOSS...\n\n  * Learn Bash scripting for FREE with this Bash Tutorial series.\n  * Join our community forum.\n  * \ud83d\udce9 Stay updated with the latest on Linux and Open Source.
