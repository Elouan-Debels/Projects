There was little scurvy in\n> Nelson\u2019s days; but the reason is not clear, since, according to modern\n> research, lime-juice only helps to prevent it. We had, at Cape Evans, a salt\n> of sodium to be used to alkalize the blood as an experiment, if necessity\n> arose. Darkness, cold, and hard work are in Atkinson\u2019s opinion important\n> causes of scurvy.\n\nNow, I had been taught in school that scurvy had been conquered in 1747, when\nthe Scottish physician James Lind proved in one of the first controlled\nmedical experiments that citrus fruits were an effective cure for the disease.\nFrom that point on, we were told, the Royal Navy had required a daily dose of\nlime juice to be mixed in with sailors\u2019 grog, and scurvy ceased to be a\nproblem on long ocean voyages.\n\nBut here was a Royal Navy surgeon in 1911 apparently ignorant of what caused\nthe disease, or how to cure it. Somehow a highly-trained group of scientists\nat the start of the 20th century knew less about scurvy than the average sea\ncaptain in Napoleonic times. Scott left a base abundantly stocked with fresh\nmeat, fruits, apples, and lime juice, and headed out on the ice for five\nmonths with no protection against scurvy, all the while confident he was not\nat risk. What happened?\n\n...\n\nBy all accounts scurvy is a horrible disease. Scott, who has reason to know,\ngives a succinct description:\n\n> The symptoms of scurvy do not necessarily occur in a regular order, but\n> generally the first sign is an inflamed, swollen condition of the gums. The\n> whitish pink tinge next the teeth is replaced by an angry red; as the\n> disease gains ground the gums become more spongy and turn to a purplish\n> colour, the teeth become loose and the gums sore. Spots appear on the legs,\n> and pain is felt in old wounds and bruises; later, from a slight oedema, the\n> legs, and then the arms, swell to a great size and become blackened behind\n> the joints. After this the patient is soon incapacitated, and the last\n> horrible stages of the disease set in, from which death is a merciful\n> release.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the disease is the disproportion between\nits severity and the simplicity of the cure. Today we know that scurvy is due\nsolely to a deficiency in vitamin C, a compound essential to metabolism that\nthe human body must obtain from food. Scurvy is rapidly and completely cured\nby restoring vitamin C into the diet.\n\nExcept for the nature of vitamin C, eighteenth century physicians knew this\ntoo. But in the second half of the nineteenth century, the cure for scurvy was\nlost. The story of how this happened is a striking demonstration of the\nproblem of induction, and how progress in one field of study can lead to\nunintended steps backward in another.\n\nAn unfortunate series of accidents conspired with advances in technology to\ndiscredit the cure for scurvy. What had been a simple dietary deficiency\nbecame a subtle and unpredictable disease that could strike without warning.\nOver the course of fifty years, scurvy would return to torment not just Polar\nexplorers, but thousands of infants born into wealthy European and American\nhomes. And it would only be through blind luck that the actual cause of scurvy\nwould be rediscovered, and vitamin C finally isolated, in 1932.\n\nIt is not easy to find fresh foods that lack vitamin C. Plants and animals\ntend to be full of it, since the molecule is used in all kinds of biochemical\nsynthesis as an electron donor. But the same reactive qualities that make the\nvitamin useful also make it easy to destroy. Vitamin C quickly breaks down in\nthe presence of light, heat and air. For this reason it is absent from most\npreserved foods that have been cooked or dried. Its destruction is also\nrapidly catalyzed by copper ions, which may be one reason sailors, with their\nbig copper cooking vats, were particularly susceptible.\n\nBecause our bodies can't synthesize the vitamin, they have grown very good at\nconserving it. It takes up to six months for scurvy to develop in healthy\npeople after vitamin C is removed from the diet, and only a tiny daily amount\nis enough to keep a person healthy.\n\nIt has been known since antiquity that fresh foods in general, and lemons and\noranges in particular, will cure scurvy. Starting with Vasco da Gama\u2019s crew in\n1497, sailors have repeatedly discovered the curative power of citrus fruits,\nand the cure has just as frequently been forgotten or ignored by subsequent\nexplorers.\n\nLind tends to get the credit for discovering the citrus cure since he\nperformed something approaching a controlled experiment. But it took an\nadditional forty years of experiments, analysis, and political lobbying for\nhis result to become institutionalized in the Royal Navy. In 1799, all Royal\nNavy ships on foreign service were ordered to serve lemon juice:\n\n> The scheduled allowance for the sailors in the Navy was fixed at I oz.lemon\n> juice with I + oz. sugar, served daily after 2 weeks at sea, the lemon juice\n> being often called \u2018lime juice\u2019 and our sailors \u2018lime juicers\u2019. The\n> consequences of this new regulation were startling and by the beginning of\n> the nineteenth century scurvy may be said to have vanished from the British\n> navy. In 1780, the admissions of scurvy cases to the Naval Hospital at\n> Haslar were 1457; in the years from 1806 to 1810, they were two.\n\n(As we'll see, the confusion between lemons and limes would have serious\nreprecussions.)\n\nScurvy had been the leading killer of sailors on long ocean voyages; some\nships experienced losses as high as 90% of their men. With the introduction of\nlemon juice, the British suddenly held a massive strategic advantage over\ntheir rivals, one they put to good use in the Napoleonic wars. British ships\ncould now stay out on blockade duty for two years at a time, strangling French\nports even as the merchantmen who ferried citrus to the blockading ships\ncontinued to die of scurvy, prohibited from touching the curative themselves.\n\nThe success of lemon juice was so total that much of Sicily was soon\ntransformed into a lemon orchard for the British fleet. Scurvy continued to be\na vexing problem in other navies, who were slow to adopt citrus as a cure, as\nwell as in the Merchant Marine, but for the Royal Navy it had become a disease\nof the past.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, however, advances in technology were\nreducing the need for any kind of scurvy preventative. Steam power had\nshortened travel times considerably from the age of sail, so that it was rare\nfor sailors other than whalers to be months at sea without fresh food. Citrus\njuice was a legal requirement on all British vessels by 1867, but in practical\nterms it was becoming superfluous.\n\nSo when the Admiralty began to replace lemon juice with an ineffective\nsubstitute in 1860, it took a long time for anyone to notice. In that year,\nnaval authorities switched procurement from Mediterranean lemons to West\nIndian limes. The motives for this were mainly colonial - it was better to buy\nfrom British plantations than to continue importing lemons from Europe.\nConfusion in naming didn't help matters. Both \"lemon\" and \"lime\" were in use\nas a collective term for citrus, and though European lemons and sour limes are\nquite different fruits, their Latin names (citrus medica, var. limonica and\ncitrus medica, var. acida) suggested that they were as closely related as\ngreen and red apples. Moreover, as there was a widespread belief that the\nantiscorbutic properties of lemons were due to their acidity, it made sense\nthat the more acidic Caribbean limes would be even better at fighting the\ndisease.\n\nIn this, the Navy was deceived. Tests on animals would later show that fresh\nlime juice has a quarter of the scurvy-fighting power of fresh lemon juice.\nAnd the lime juice being served to sailors was not fresh, but had spent long\nperiods of time in settling tanks open to the air, and had been pumped through\ncopper tubing. A 1918 animal experiment using representative samples of lime\njuice from the navy and merchant marine showed that the 'preventative' often\nlacked any antiscorbutic power at all.\n\nBy the 1870s, therefore, most British ships were sailing without protection\nagainst scurvy. Only speed and improved nutrition on land were preventing\nsailors from getting sick.\n\nIt fell to the unfortunate George Nares to discover this fact in 1875, when he\nled the British Arctic Expedition in an attempt to reach the North Pole via\nGreenland. Some oceanographic theories of the time posited an open polar sea,\nand Nares was directed to sail along the Greenland coast, then take a sledging\nparty and see how far north he could get on the pack ice.\n\nThe expedition was a fiasco. Two men in the sledging party developed scurvy\nwithin days of leaving the ship. Within five weeks, half the men were sick,\nand despite having laid depots with plentiful supplies for their return\njourney, they were barely able to make it back. A rescue party sent to\nintercept them found that lime juice failed to have its usual dramatic effect.\nMost damning of all, some of the men who stayed on the ship, never failing to\ntake their daily dose, also got scurvy.\n\nThe failure of the Nares expedition provoked an uproar in Britain. The Royal\nNavy believed itself capable of sustaining any crew for two years without\nsigns of scurvy, yet here was an able and adequately supplied crew crippled by\nthe disease within weeks. For the first time since the eighteenth century, the\neffectiveness of citrus juice as an absolute preventative was in doubt.\n\nMore troubling evidence came several years later, during the Jackson-\nHarmsworth Expedition to Franz-Josef Land in 1894. Members of this expedition\nspent three years on a ship frozen into the pack ice. Koettlitz, their chief\nphysician, describes what happened:\n\n> The expedition proper ate fresh meat regularly at least once a day in the\n> shape of polar bear. The people on the ship had, however, a prejudice\n> against this food, which certainly was not particularly palatable, and\n> insisted, against all advice, upon eating their preserved and salted meat.\n> This meat I occasionally noticed to be somewhat \"high\" or \"gamey\", and\n> afterwards heard that it was often so. The result was that, though I visited\n> the ship every day, and personally saw that each man swallowed his dose of\n> lime juice (which was made compulsory, and was of the best quality), the\n> whole ship\u2019s company were tainted with scurvy, and two died.\n\nThis pattern of fresh meat preventing scurvy would be a consistent one in\nArctic exploration. It defied the common understanding of scurvy as a\ndeficiency in vegetable matter. Somehow men could live for years on a meat-\nonly diet and remain healthy, provided that the meat was fresh.\n\nThis is a good example of how the very ubiquity of vitamin C made it hard to\nidentify. Though scurvy was always associated with a lack of greens, fresh\nmeat contains adequate amounts of vitamin C, with particularly high\nconcentrations in the organ meats that explorers considered a delicacy. Eat a\nbear liver every few weeks and scurvy will be the least of your problems.\n\nBut unless you already understand and believe in the vitamin model of\nnutrition, the notion of a trace substance that exists both in fresh limes and\nbear kidneys, but is absent from a cask of lime juice because you happened to\nprepare it in a copper vessel, begins to sound pretty contrived.\n\nDoctors of the era looked at this puzzling evidence and wondered. Other\ndiseases had recently been shown to have their source in bacterial infection.\nThe bacterial model was new, and had already had spectacular success in\nidentifying and treating diseases like typhus, tuberculosis, and cholera. What\nif the cause of scruvy had also been misunderstood? What if instead of a\ndeficiency disease, scurvy was actually a kind of chronic food poisoning from\nbacterial contamination of meat? Thus was born the ptomaine theory of scurvy,\nand Koettlitz became its enthusiastic backer:\n\n> That the cause of the outbreak of scurvy in so many Polar expeditions has\n> always been that something was radically wrong with the preserved meats,\n> whether tinned or salted, is practically certain; that foods are scurvy-\n> producing by being, if only slightly, tainted is practically certain; that\n> the benefit of the so-called \"antiscorbutics\" is a delusion, and that some\n> antiscorbutic property has been removed from foods in the process of\n> preservation is also a delusion. An animal food is either scorbutic\u2014in other\n> words, scurvy-producing\u2014or it is not. It is either tainted or it is sound.\n> Putrefactive change, if only slight and tasteless, has taken place or it has\n> not. Bacteria have been able to produce ptomaines in it or they have not;\n> and if they have not, then the food is healthy and not scurvy-producing.\n\nThe \u2019ptomaine\u2019 in the theory was never really defined, other than as a noxious\nwaste product of bacterial action. But the theory had an internal logic.\nPoorly preserved meats would be contaminated by ptomaine. Under normal\nconditions, this was not enough to cause scurvy. Not only did fresh food\nconsumed in the diet have a kind of antidote effect (whether it worked by\nneutralizing the poison, or by simply displacing it in the diet, was not\nclear), but environment also played an important role. Certain factors seemed\nto predispose people to chronic ptomaine poisoning, including darkness,\nintense exertion, idleness, close air, prolonged confinement and cold.\n\nOn long journeys under harsh conditions, the accumulated ptomaine in badly\npreserved meats would disrupt health, giving the classic symptoms of scurvy.\nOnce the tainted foods were discontinued, the body would rapidly excrete the\naccumulated ptomaine and return to health.\n\nTo the extent that citrus juices were effective in preventing scurvy, it was\nbecause their acidity denatured ptomaines, or killed the bacteria that caused\nthem. The real culprit was in the bad meat, and the casks of lime juice\nmandated by law on every seagoing ship were another example of outdated\nmedical superstition that would now give way to a more sophisticated\nunderstanding of illness.\n\nThis was the latest in medical thinking on scurvy when Scott prepared for his\nfirst expedition to Antarctica, in 1903. It would be the first serious British\nexpedition to the continent in fifty years. Scott took the very same Dr.\nKoettlitz along as his chief physician.\n\nScott was a meticulous planner, and mindful of the ptomaine theory, paid\nspecial attention to the quality of his provisions. While the cold and cramped\nconditions of the journey could not be helped, he knew he could avoid any risk\nof scurvy by using only completely unspoiled canned goods. For his part,\nKoettlitz predicted that as long as there was fresh seal meat available \u201cwe\ncan take it as certain that no scurvy will be heard of in connexion with the\nexpedition, however long it may remain in the High South.\u201d\n\nScott did not have time to supervise the actual canning of his provisions for\nthe Discovery journey, but he made sure that before being served, all tins\nwere opened in the presence of his medical staff, including Dr. Koettlitz, and\ncarefully examined for signs of spoilage. Any doubtful cans were consigned to\nthe trash heap.\n\nSo it came as a bitter surprise to Scott when one of the Discovery\u2019s early\nsledging parties trudged into camp with unmistakable symptoms of scurvy after\nonly a three week absence. Subsequent examination showed that many of the men\non the ship were also in the early stages of the disease. The preventative\nmeasures had failed, and Scott was greatly distressed:\n\n> The evil having come, the great thing now is to banish it. In my absence,\n> Armitage, in consultation with the doctors, has already taken steps to\n> remedy matters by serving out fresh meat regularly and by increasing the\n> allowance of bottled fruits, and he has done an even greater service by\n> taking the cook in hand. I don\u2019t know whether he threatened to hang him at\n> the yardarm or used more persuasive measures, but, whatever it was, there is\n> a marked improvement in the cooking.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> With the idea of giving everyone on the mess-deck a change of air in turn,\n> we have built up a space in the main hut by packing cases around the stove.\n> In this space each mess are to live for a week; they have breakfast and\n> dinner on board, but are allowed to cook their supper in the hut. The\n> present occupants enjoy this sort of picnic-life immensely.\n>\n> We have had a thorough clearance of the holds, disinfected the bilges,\n> whitewashed the sides, and generally made them sweet and clean.\n>\n> As a next step I tackled the clothes and hammocks. One knows how easily\n> garments collect, and especially under such conditions as ours; however,\n> they have all been cleared out now, except those actually in use. The\n> hammocks and bedding I found quite dry and comfortable, but we have had them\n> all thoroughly aired. We have cleared all the deck-lights so as to get more\n> daylight below, and we have scrubbed the decks and cleaned out all the holes\n> and corners until everything is as clean as a new pin. I am bound to confess\n> there was no very radical change in all this; we found very little dirt, and\n> our outbreak cannot possibly have come from insanitary conditions of living;\n> our men are far too much alive to their own comfort for that. But now we do\n> everything for the safe side, and from the conviction that one cannot be too\n> careful.\n\nScott sent a seal-killing party to collect as much fresh meat as possible (his\ncrew could eat their way through a seal in two and a half days). They gathered\nenough to eliminate the need for preserved meat entirely. The butchered seals\nwere stored, like logs, frozen on the ice. Meanwhile, Koetlittz had managed to\nsprout and grow a modest crop of watercress under a skylight, the Antarctic\nsoil proving surprisingly fertile. His confidence in the ptomaine theory did\nnot blind him to the practical advantages of a proven remedy (watercress\nsprouts contain a ridiculous amount of vitamin C). Enough cress grew to\nsupplement one meal for all the men, and in combination with the fresh seal\nmeat, it was enough to banish all signs of scurvy.\n\nScott was relieved, but he knew that something had escaped his understanding.\nDespite scrupulous care, the disease had slipped through, and he was not sure\nwhy his precautions had failed. Evidently it was not enough to inspect meat by\ntaste and smell\u2014even minute quanities of ptomaine might be enough to cause\nscurvy.\n\nHis solution was to move the expedition off of canned meat altogether, relying\nentirely on seal meat and penguin. This would be fine while the men remained\non the Discovery, but it left the problem of what to do about the upcoming\nsledge journeys. The planned sledging ration was pemmican (a mixture of dried\nmeat and fat) and biscuit, but since Scott had lost all confidence in the\nsafety of preserved meat, he had to find a way to replace the pemmican with\nseal.\n\nFresh seal meat would be far too heavy a replacement, so Scott had it\nrepeatedly boiled to remove as much moisture as possible (in the process\ndestroying all its vitamin C). This concentrated seal meat was still almost\ntwice as heavy as the equivalent pemmican, but it was the best he could do.\n\nIn November of 1902, Scott, Wilson and Shackleton set out on the expedition\u2019s\nmain journey. Their goal was to take a dog team as far south as possible along\nthe Ross ice shelf, and see if they could find a useful route for an eventual\nattempt at the Pole.\n\nThings did not go well. Scott inadvertently starved his dogs, making them\nimpossible to control and nearly useless for hauling. Very quickly his men had\nto start relaying the sledges, which meant walking three miles for every one\nmile of southward progress. They began killing the weakest dogs and feeding\nthem to the remainder (the dogs were so hungry they did not hesitate to rip\ntheir fallen comrades apart). The men themselves could think of nothing else\nbut food, their rations inadequate for the work of hauling the sledge.\n\nWilson, a doctor, checked the men\u2019s gums and legs each Sunday for signs of\nscurvy. Shackleton was the first to show symptoms, though he was not told\nabout this for several weeks. Soon Scott and Wilson were showing symptoms as\nwell. Before long Shackleton was weak, had begun to cough up blood at night,\nand was in real danger of physical collapse.\n\nThe party barely made it home. For much of the return trip, Shackleton was\nunable to pull, staggering alongside the sledges. On their return to the\nDiscovery, the men were bedridden and in a state of complete physical\ncollapse, getting up only long enough to eat prodigious meals. Scott remarked\nin his journal on the extraordinary lassitude and lack of energy the disease\nprovoked in him.\n\nEight years after the Discovery expedition, Scott returned to Antarctica to\nmake an attempt at the Pole. Mindful of what had happened on his first\njourney, he took pains to seek the latest expert advice about scurvy, both\nfrom doctors and from Arctic explorers.\n\nThe advice he got was unchanged\u2014scurvy was an acidic condition of the blood\ncaused by ptomaines in tainted meat. The legendary explorer Fridtjof Nansen\nhad some particularly curious advice\u2014if he found himself in extremis, Nansen\nsaid, it was better to choose cans of meat that were completely rotten over\ncans that were only slightly spoilt, since the ptomaines were more likely to\nhave broken down in the former.\n\nThis time Scott made sure to provide his men with fresh seal meat, and scurvy\nwas not a problem in the main camp. In the austral winter of 1911, Wilson,\nBowers, and Cherry-Garrard went on a phantasmagoric five week journey to try\nand collect the eggs of the empreror penguin. This journey, which gave Cherry-\nGarrard\u2019s book its title, took place in complete darkness and temperatures\nthat dropped below -77o Fahrenheit. The men, forced to relay and searching for\ntheir footprints by candlelight, sometimes made as little as a mile of\nprogress a day. When Cherry-Garrard\u2019s clothes were weighed on his return, they\ncontained twenty-four pounds of ice. That the men survived defies belief\u2014there\nhas never been another journey in the Polar night, even with modern\nequipment\u2014but they did return, and to Scott's great relief showed no symptoms\nof scurvy.\n\nOne of Scott's goals for the winter journey had been to determine the proper\nration for sledging up on the Polar plateau, where the men would have to hike\nfor several weeks at altitudes above 10,000 feet. After some tinkering with\nproportions, the men on the Winter Journey had settled on a satisfying ration,\nand Scott decided to adopt it unchanged for his own trip later that year:\n\nScott's Polar ration: 450g biscuit, 340 grams pemmican, 85g sugar, 57g butter,\n24g tea, 16g cocoa. This ration contains about 4500 calories (sledging\nrequires 6500) and no vitamin C.\n\nScott left camp with 16 men on November 1, 1911. His plan was to lay depots\nalong the route, and send groups of men back at intervals until he was left\nwith three companions on the great plateau south of the Beardmore Glacier. The\nexpedition used men, dogs, ponies (slaughtered and fed to the dogs at the foot\nof the glacier), and a pair of experimental motorized sledges that broke down\nafter just a few miles on the ice.\n\nScott sent back his men in stages; each group had a progressively harder time\nmaking it back to camp. The last group, sent back from the top of the\nBeardmore, was led by Edward Evans, who quickly developed a severe case of\nscurvy. After bravely walking most of the distance, he became incapacitated\nand had to be left on the ice in the care of a companion while the third man\nin the group force-marched the thirty remaining miles to camp to summon a\nrescue team.\n\nScott, oblivious to this ominous development, pressed onwards. The rest of his\nstory is well known. Norwegian tents at the Pole, an increasingly desperate\nreturn, two in his group sickening and dying, then a terrible blizzard eleven\nmiles short of his last depot; the three men freezing to death in their tent.\n\nThe evidence that the Polar Party suffered from scurvy on their return trip is\nstrong but circumstantial. The wounds that would not heal, the sudden death of\nSeaman Evans during the descent down the Beardmore, their great weakness are\nall consistent with the disease. Both Scott and Wilson would have easily\nrecognized the symptoms, but it is possible that they would have chosen not to\nrecord them. There was a certain stigma with scurvy, especially in their case,\nhaving taken such pains to forestall the disease. Scott had nearly left any\nmention of scurvy out of his 1903 report, before deciding to do so for the\ncause of science, and it\u2019s possible he felt a similar reticence now.\n\nEntire academic careers have been devoted to second-guessing Scott's final\njourney. It would probably be easier to list the few things that didn\u2019t\ncontribute to his death, than to try and rank the relative contributions of\ncold, exhaustion, malnutrition, bad weather, bad luck, poor planning, and rash\ndecisions. But with regard to scurvy, at least, the Polar explorers were in an\nimpossible position.\n\nThey had a theory of the disease that made sense, fit the evidence, but was\nutterly wrong. They had arrived at the idea of an undetectable substance in\ntheir food, present in trace quantities, with a direct causative relationship\nto scurvy, but they thought of it in terms of a poison to avoid. In one sense,\nthe additional leap required for a correct understanding was very small. In\nanother sense, it would have required a kind of Copernican revolution in their\nthinking.\n\nIt was pure luck that led to the actual discovery of vitamin C. Axel Holst and\nTheodor Frolich had been studying beriberi (another deficiency disease) in\npigeons, and when they decided to switch to a mammal model, they\nserendipitously chose guinea pigs, the one animal besides human beings and\nmonkeys that requires vitamin C in its diet. Fed a diet of pure grain, the\nanimals showed no signs of beriberi, but quickly sickened and died of\nsomething that closely resembled human scurvy.\n\nNo one had seen scurvy in animals before. With a simple animal model for the\ndisease in hand, it became a matter of running the correct experiments, and it\nwas quickly established that scurvy was a deficiency disease after all. Very\nquickly the compound that prevents the disease was identified as a small\nmolecule present in cabbage, lemon juice, and many other foods, and in 1932\nSzent-Gy\u00f6rgyi definitively isolated ascorbic acid.\n\n\\---\n\nThere are several aspects of this 'second coming\u2019 of scurvy in the late 19th\ncentury that I find particularly striking:\n\nFirst, the fact that from the fifteenth century on, it was the rare doctor who\nacknowledged ignorance about the cause and treatment of the disease. The\nsickness could be fitted to so many theories of disease\u2014imbalance in vital\nhumors, bad air, acidification of the blood, bacterial infection\u2014that despite\nthe existence of an unambigous cure, there was always a raft of alternative,\nineffective treatments. At no point did physicians express doubt about their\ntheories, however ineffective.\n\nSecond, how difficult it was to correctly interpret the evidence without the\nconcept of \u2018vitamin\u2019. Now that we understand scurvy as a deficiency disease,\nwe can explain away the anomalous results that seem to contradict that theory\n(the failure of lime juice on polar expeditions, for example). But the\nevidence on its own did not point clearly at any solution. It was not clear\nwhich results were the anomalous ones that needed explaining away. The\nptomaine theory made correct predictions (fresh meat will prevent scurvy) even\nthough it was completely wrong.\n\nThird, how technological progress in one area can lead to surprising\nregressions. I mentioned how the advent of steam travel made it possible to\naccidentally replace an effective antiscorbutic with an ineffective one. An\neven starker example was the rash of cases of infantile scurvy that afflicted\nupper class families in the late 19th century. This outbreak was the direct\nresult of another technological development, the pasteurization of cow's milk.\nThe procedure made milk vastly safer for infants to drink, but also destroyed\nvitamin C. For poorer children, who tended to be breast-fed and quickly weaned\nonto adult foods, this was not an issue, but the wealthy infants fed a special\ndiet of cooked cereals and milk were at grave risk.\n\nIt took several years for infant scurvy, at first called \u201cBarlow's disease\u201d,\nto be properly identified. At that point doctors were caught between two\nfires. They could recommend that parents not boil their milk, and expose the\nchildren to bacterial infection, or they could insist on pasteurization at the\nrisk of scurvy. The prevaling theory of scurvy as bacterial poisoning clouded\nthe issue further, so that it took time to arrive at the right\nsolution\u2014supplementing the diet with onion juice or cooked potato.\n\nFourth, how small a foundation of evidence was necessary to build a soaring\nedifice of theory. Lind\u2019s famous experiment, for example, had two sailors\neating oranges for six days. Lind went on to propound a completely ineffective\nmethod of preserving lemon juice (by boiling it down), which he never thought\nto test. One of the experiments that \u2019confirmed\u2019 the ptomaine theory involved\nfeeding a handful of monkeys canned and fresh meat. The fructivorous monkeys\ndied within days; the ones who died last, and with the least blood in their\nstool, were assumed to be the ones without scurvy. And even these flawed\nexperiments were a rarity compared to the number of flat assertions by medical\nauthorities without any testing or basis in fact.\n\nFinally, that one of the simplest of diseases managed to utterly confound us\nfor so long, at the cost of millions of lives, even after we had stumbled\nacross an unequivocal cure. It makes you wonder how many incurable ailments of\nthe modern world\u2014depression, autism, hypertension, obesity\u2014will turn out to\nhave equally simple solutions, once we are able to see them in the correct\nlight. What will we be slapping our foreheads about sixty years from now,\nwondering how we missed something so obvious?\n\nIn the course of writing this essay, I was tempted many times to pick a\nvillain. Maybe the perfectly named Almroth Wright, who threw his considerable\nmedical reputation behind the ptomaine theory and so delayed the proper re-\nunderstanding of scurvy for many years. Or the nameless Admiralty flunkie who\nhelped his career by championing the switch to West Indian limes. Or even poor\nScott himself, sermonizing about the virtues of scientific progress while\nnever conducting a proper experiment, taking dreadful risks, and showing a\nmost unscientific reliance on pure grit to get his men out of any difficulty.\n\nBut the villain here is just good old human ignorance, that master of\ndisguise.
