We made the difficult decision to stop support for Dropcam and\nDropcam Pro starting April 8, 2024. These cameras won\u2019t be able to connect to\nthe app, stream, or record video.\n\nWhat this means for you:\n\n  * Support for Dropcam has ended. You won\u2019t be able to use the Nest app to check the status of your Dropcam, view live streams, receive notifications, or change settings.\n\n  * Your Nest Aware subscription has not been automatically canceled. If your Nest Aware subscription covers all the devices in your home, it will continue to work with any other Nest cameras in your home.\n\n  * If you have a 1st gen Nest Aware per device subscription and want to cancel it, you will need to cancel your subscription at home.nest.com. If you already have a Google Account, you can cancel through the Google Home app.\n\n  * Your video history is no longer available as of April 8, 2024.\n\nFor more information, go to this Community Forum post.\n\n## How to tell which Dropcam you have\n\nThe most visible difference between the two Dropcams is that Dropcam Pro has a\nblack stand, while Dropcam has a grey one. Because of slight differences in\nthe size of the two cameras, the stands can't be swapped. The table below\noutlines other key differences between the two.  \n---  \nDropcam| Dropcam Pro  \n---|---  \nSetup| Mac or PC| Bluetooth LE enabled iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch as well as\nMac or PC  \nMaximum video resolution| 720p HD| 720p HD  \nField of view| 107\u00b0| 130\u00b0  \nImage sensor| 1/4\", 1 megapixel| 1/3\", 3 megapixel  \nDepth of zoom| 4x| 8x  \nNetwork frequencies| 2.4 GHz| 2.4 and 5 GHz  \nNumber of infrared LEDs| 6 (Late model); 12 (Early model)| 8  \nLens| Composite| Glass  \nColor| Grey| Black  \n  \n## More about Dropcam and Dropcam Pro\n\nWhile both Dropcams offer a beautiful HD image, Dropcam Pro's all-glass lens\nand larger image sensor provide a sharper picture, with richer colors. This\nalso allows for clearer close-ups when zooming in.\n\nBoth cameras can connect to 802.11 b, g, and n 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi networks. Dropcam\nPro also connects to 802.11n 5 GHz networks.\n\n## Was this helpful?\n\nHow can we improve it?\n\n## Need more help?\n\n### Try these next steps:\n\nPost to the help community Get answers from community members\n\nContact us Tell us more and we\u2019ll help you get there\n\ntrue\n\nHave a question?\n\nGet an answer from an expert on the Google Home Help Forum.\n\n  * \u00a92024 Google\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Service\n\nEnable Dark Mode\n\nSend feedback on...\n\n4703067074152557025\n\ntrue\n\nSearch Help Center\n\ntrue\n\ntrue\n\ntrue\n\nGoogle Help\n\n  * Help Center\n    * Speakers and Displays\n    * Nest Thermostat\n    * Cameras and Doorbell\n    * Locks and Alarm Systems\n    * Smoke Alarms\n    * Wi-Fi\n    * Subscriptions and Services\n    * Nest Common Concerns\n    * Your privacy\n  * Community\n  * Google Nest\n\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Submit feedback\n\nGet startedExplore featuresChange your settingsFix a problemWarranty, manual\nand returns\n\nIntroducing Nest thermostatsGet startedExplore features and settings Fix a\nproblemWarranty, manual & returns\n\nIntroducing Nest cameras and doorbellsGet startedExplore features and\nsettingsFix a problemWarranty, manual & returns\n\nLocksAlarm Systems\n\nIntroducing Nest ProtectGet startedExplore features and settings Safety and\ncertifications Fix a problemWarranty, manual & returns\n\nLearn about Wifi productsGet startedFeatures and settingsFix a\nproblemWarranty, manual & returnsYour privacy\n\nNest AwarePartner Devices and ServicesNest RenewRush Hour RewardsHVAC\nmonitoringNest Pro installationADT\n\nNest ProductsNest App AccountsNotifications and Emails\n\nSearch\n\nClear search\n\nClose search\n\nMain menu\n\nGoogle apps\n\ntrue\n\ntrue\n\n1633396\n\nfalse\n\nfalse\n\n", "frontpage": false}
