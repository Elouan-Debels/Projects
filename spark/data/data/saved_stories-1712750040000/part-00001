But multiple far-right activist groups with ties to former\npresident Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee are mobilizing\ntheir supporters in earnest, drawing on one baseline belief: Elections in the\nUS are rigged, and citizens need to do something about it.\n\nAll the evidence states otherwise. But in recent weeks, these groups have held\ntraining sessions about how to organize on a hyperlocal level to monitor\npolling places and drop boxes, challenge voter registrations en masse, and\nintimidate and harass voters and election officials. And some are preparing to\nroll out new technology to fast-track all of these efforts: One of the groups\nclaims they\u2019re launching a new platform for checking voter rolls that contains\nbillions of \u201cdata elements\u201d on every single US citizen.\n\nThese groups could have a major impact on the 2024 election. In addition to\ndisenfranchising voters and putting additional pressure on already\noverstretched election offices, they could convince more and more people that\nUS elections are fraudulent.\n\nCatherine Engelbrecht and her organization True the Vote have effectively\ntried to disenfranchise voters for more than a decade by claiming that voter\nrolls are filled with phony voter registrations. Engelbrecht\u2019s rhetoric was\ngiven an unprecedented boost in the wake of 2020, when Trump and other elected\nofficials mainstreamed conspiracies that the elections had been rigged in\nfavor of Democrats. Hundreds of national and local election denial groups were\nformed, and many of them amassed huge followings on social media platforms\nlike Telegram. As the 2024 presidential election looms, they are ramping up\nefforts to do it again.\n\n\u201cIt could be exponentially worse than what we saw in 2020, but we're going to\nbe awake, we're going to be engaged, we are going to understand the process,\nand we're going to have options to continue to hold to those truths,\u201d\nEngelbrecht said during a March webinar titled \u201cElection Integrity Team\nBuilding 101.\u201d \u201cWe're not going to back down. There's too much to lose.\u201d\n\nThe hour-long presentation was delivered from a hotel room in Denver, with\nEngelbrecht laying out what could sound like a relatively benign plan to\nmonitor elections and check voter rolls. \u201cKeep a soft heart, keep a kind word\nin your mouth, approach people irrespective of party with love. You will find\nthat things will be much better if that is the approach that is taken,\u201d\nEngelbrecht said. The session, she said, was overbooked.\n\nEngelbrecht then began speaking about elections being \u201cperilously close to\ncracking in half,\u201d and her presentation became a highlight reel of election\nconspiracies, references to crystals, Christian nationalist rhetoric, and\nmilitaristic jargon. \u201cIf this republic\u2019s to be saved, it's because [of] people\nlike all of you that are on this webinar right now. There are some bad actors\nout there and we live in particularly chaotic and caustic times,\u201d said\nEngelbrecht. \u201cIf we wait on somebody to do something, we will watch freedom\nslip away on our watch. That's how close we are.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

But the more chaos that\ncan be caused along the way will give more fodder to that disinformation,\u201d\nAndrew Garber, an expert at the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Voting Rights and\nElections Program, tells WIRED. \u201cIt's not just bad if there's a mass voter\nchallenge because people might get kicked off the rolls. It's also bad if\npeople then take that challenge and say, \u2018See, look at all these ineligible\nvoters,\u2019 when in fact that's not the case.\u201d\n\nEngelbrecht founded True the Vote in 2010, when she was an activist for the\nright-wing populist Tea Party movement. After the 2020 election, Engelbrecht\nand her collaborator Gregg Phillips became central figures in the Stop the\nSteal movement, and starred in the widely-debunked election conspiracy film\n2000 Mules. They were also arrested for contempt of court after refusing to\nidentify their source behind allegations that the Chinese government had\naccessed US election data. True the Vote also made wild allegations of\nwidespread ballot stuffing in Georgia during the 2020 vote and a subsequent\nrunoff in 2021. Earlier this year, True the Vote was forced to admit in court\nthat the group had no evidence to back up its claims.\n\nIn 2022, the group rolled out a slick new software tool known as IV3, based on\ntechnology developed by Phillips, that compared names on voter rolls to a\ndatabase maintained by the US Postal Service, allowing anyone to challenge\nvoter registrations across the country if they spotted a discrepancy. A WIRED\ninvestigation, however, revealed that the information used to challenge the\nregistration of hundreds of thousands of people was based on unreliable data.\n\nUndeterred, True the Vote announced last week that it was relaunching IV3.\nPhillips claims that the software\u2019s database now has close to \u201c100 billion\ndata elements about every single voter in the United States.\u201d WIRED has not\nseen proof of this claim. The new IV3 system will soon be available in all 50\nstates, the organization said. On Thursday, the group held a webinar to train\nlocal activists on how to use it. The new system also relies on data from the\nUS Postal Service, but Engelbrecht claimed during the presentation that\nPhillips and his team had \u201cnormalized\u201d the data from all 50 states to ensure\nthe system would not produce inaccurate results. She also said that thousands\nof people across the country were already registered, and that they had a long\nwaiting list.\n\nAdditionally, she said that another software tool developed by Phillips\u2019 team,\ncalled Ground Fusion, would be released soon; it is aimed at organizations and\nPACs looking to identify voting irregularities across larger geographic\nregions.\n\nEngelbrecht declined to comment, claiming without evidence that WIRED had\n\u201cwritten unfairly about True the Vote and IV3 in the past.\u201d\n\nTrue the Vote is not the only group seeking to leverage technology to\nsupercharge the spread of election conspiracies. A secretive Georgia-based\nfirm called EagleAI NETwork has developed a voter information database to\nfast-track the deletion of ineligible voters from the system. Voter rights\ngroups have advised against its use, as insignificant errors\u2014such as a missing\ncomma before the suffix \u201cJr.\u201d\u2014have led to eligible names being removed. Still,\nat least one county in Georgia has agreed to use EagleAI to review voter\nchallenges and conduct list maintenance activities.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

Broadcasted online to\nhundreds of attendees, the webinar featured a lineup of election\nconspiracists, Republican lawmakers, a guy who wrote a book about fifth-\ngeneration warfare, and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nThe webinar, the group\u2019s website said, was designed to give people \u201cthe\nsecrets to reclaiming our power and reshaping history\u201d by using \u201cstate-of-the-\nart election tools,\u201d including those involving artificial intelligence\ntechnology. While the details of exactly what these tools will look like and\nhow they will be used are unclear, the America Project has already scheduled\nmore training sessions in the coming weeks to give supporters more\ninformation. The group also did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe America Project was cofounded by disgraced former national security\nadviser Michael Flynn and former Overstock.com CEO and conspiracist Patrick\nByrne, who also funds part of the organization. Both Flynn and Byrne\nreportedly attended a White House meeting in late 2020 to urge Trump to\nessentially declare martial law and seize voting machines.\n\nWhile Flynn didn\u2019t speak during last month\u2019s webinar, he has arguably done\nmore than anyone since 2020 to push the notion that America\u2019s elections are\nfundamentally fraudulent, appearing at conferences, in podcasts, and on right-\nwing news shows on a near-daily basis. Trump has also indicated that Flynn\nwill be brought back into his administration should he win.\n\nThese efforts have been given the seal of approval by the Republican National\nCommittee, which was recently restructured by Trump to include election\ndeniers and family members in top positions while cutting minority outreach\nefforts. One of those election deniers is Christina Bobb, who will be running\nthe \u201celection integrity unit.\u201d A former Trump lawyer and TV presenter on far-\nright channel One America News, Bobb is a major promoter of the myth that the\n2020 election was stolen from Trump. The RNC\u2019s election-related priorities,\naccording to an internal memo recently obtained by NPR, include \u201ca broader\neffort over the coming months to [legally] challenge voter identification and\nsignature verification rules which were put into place for the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nDuring the America Project webinar last month, one of the hosts apologized to\nlisteners for being unable to get Bobb to join the call that day, but promised\nthat she would join a future session\u2014highlighting just how closely these\nconspiracy-focused groups work with the mainstream GOP apparatus.\n\nMost Popular\n\n  * Science\n\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\n\nKaren Williams\n\n  * Politics\n\nElon Musk Is Platforming Far-Right Activists in Brazil, Defying Court Order\n\nVittoria Elliott\n\n  * Business\n\nBeeper Took On Apple\u2019s iMessage Dominance.

It's the election officials\nat the local level trying to keep order at the polls, trying to make sure\ntheir voter rolls are up to date, who have to deal with this stuff.\u201d\n\nOne of Flynn\u2019s core messages over the past four years has been that \u201clocal\naction equals national impact\u201d \u2014an expression that revolves around a concept\ncalled \u201cprecinct strategy,\u201d which aims to get people into key positions on\nlocal committees in order to push their narratives at the local level. In\n2024, that strategy has been primed and polished.\n\n\u201cThis concept of precinct strategy was actually endorsed by President Trump in\nthe last election cycle,\u201d Yehuda Miller, a Republican county committee member\nin New Jersey, said during the America Project seminar. \u201cWe want to take the\nstrategy to the next level. We want to get more organized, we want to start\norganizing across multiple counties in a state, we want to start organizing\nacross multiple states. We have the power to direct our elected officials.\u201d\n\n## You Might Also Like ...\n\n  * In your inbox: The best and weirdest stories from WIRED\u2019s archive\n\n  * Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island visitors exposed by data broker\n\n  * 8 Google employees invented modern AI.
