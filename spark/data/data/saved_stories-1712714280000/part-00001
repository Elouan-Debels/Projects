I saw\na British private wistfully order a pint of mild and bitter: but the glass he\nsat down with contained the eternal cider.\u201d\n\nContents\n\n  * 45 gallon Drop Tanks\n  * Flying Pubs\n  * Beer Mission\n  * The Legend Johnie Johnson\n\n## 45 gallon Drop Tanks\n\nRegrettably, there were no available transport planes to deliver non-critical\nsupplies to the forward landing grounds.\n\nTo address this, several Spitfire squadrons based out of RAF Tangmere\ningeniously adapted by using a 45-gallon drop tank\u2014typically reserved for\nfuel\u2014after steam cleaning it for the transportation of ale.\n\n\u2018Flying pub\u2019 inbound for Normandy\n\nA notable Air Ministry photo captured the moment, depicting Wing Commander\nRolf Arne Berg of No. 132 Norwegian Wing perched on the wing of a Mk IX\nSpitfire, observing as Pale Ale was transferred from kegs into the aircraft\u2019s\nmodified drop tank.\n\nThe Spitfire Mk IX represented an advanced iteration of the iconic fighter,\nequipped with pylons beneath the wings capable of holding bombs or extra fuel\ntanks.\n\nRead More: Miles M.52,1000mph, Altitude of 36,000ft in 90 Seconds\n\nIt was ingeniously discovered that these bomb pylons could be repurposed to\ntransport beer kegs.\n\nHistorical photos reveal the use of kegs in various sizes, though it\u2019s unclear\nif these could be jettisoned during emergencies. When flown at higher\naltitudes, the beer would be naturally chilled by the cold air, arriving\nperfectly cooled for enjoyment.\n\nOne notable adaptation involved converting a long-range fuel tank to carry\nbeer, a modification officially known as Mod. XXX. This clever tweak quickly\ncaught the attention of propaganda services, likely leading to its \u201cofficial\u201d\nmoniker.\n\n## Flying Pubs\n\nOfficially, it wasn\u2019t until July 12 that \u201creal British beer\u201d was formally\ndelivered to the troops fighting in Normandy, and even then it was limited to\none pint per man.\n\nHowever, well before this date, resourceful RAF and USAAF pilots had taken it\nupon themselves to covertly transport beer into Northern France, with their\naircraft fondly termed \u201cflying pubs\u201d by the servicemen.\n\nIn what was likely August 1944, possibly at Ford airfield in West Sussex,\nmembers of the 131 Fighter Wing ingeniously equipped wooden barrels with\naerodynamic \u2018nose cones\u2019 to enable their transportation in the bomb racks\nbeneath Spitfires.\n\nOne of the initial efforts to ferry beer across the Channel post-D-Day\ninvolved using the planes\u2019 expendable drop tanks, or \u201cjettison tanks\u201d as the\nRAF officially named them. These tanks, which normally carried extra fuel to\nextend the fighters\u2019 range, were appropriated for the beer deliveries.\n\nThese operations appear to have been at least semi-official; the Air Ministry\neven released a photo to the press showcasing a Spitfire from 332 (Norwegian)\nSquadron at Tangmere airfield in Sussex.\n\nThe image captured the moment beer from two wooden kegs, provided by\nChichester brewery Henty & Constable, was poured into a 45-gallon drop tank,\nwhile the pilot lounged on the aircraft\u2019s wing.\n\n## Read More: Mistel One of the Luftwaffe\u2019s Strangest Concepts\n\nThat pilot was likely Wing Commander Rolf Arne Borg, the leader of No. 132\nNorwegian wing, though the aircraft depicted wasn\u2019t his, as his own bore the\ndistinctive Norwegian red and blue rings on the spinner.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that the beer from Henty and Constable was transported in the\ndrop tanks slung beneath three Spitfire Mk IXbs from Tangmere to an airstrip\nat B\u00e9ny-Sur-Mer in Normandy.\n\nThis airfield lay 110 miles south of England and just three miles inland from\nthe coast. The first recorded delivery of beer during the invasion occurred on\nJune 13, 1944, a week after D-Day.\n\n## Beer Mission\n\nFlight Lieutenant Lloyd Berryman of 412 Squadron, 126 Wing, Second Tactical\nAir Force, Royal Canadian Air Force, was one of the pilots involved. The B\u00e9ny-\nSur-Mer airstrip, designated B4, wasn\u2019t officially completed until two days\nafter Berryman\u2019s beer run.\n\nBeer kegs instead of drop tanks\n\nHis superior, Wing Commander Keith Hudson, had singled him out during a\nbriefing at Tangmere to transport a \u201csizeable\u201d shipment of beer to B4, a\nmission Berryman later reminisced:\n\n\u201cThe instructions went something like this, \u2018Get a couple other pilots and\narrange with the officers\u2019 mess to steam out the jet [jettison] tanks and load\nthem up with beer. When we get over the beachhead drop out of formation and\nland on the strip. We\u2019re told the Nazis are fouling the drinking water, so it\nwill be appreciated. There\u2019s no trouble finding the strip, the battleship\nRodney is firing salvoes on Caen and it\u2019s immediately below. We\u2019ll be flying\nover at 13,000 [feet] so the beer will be cold enough when you arrive.\u2019\n\n\u201cI remember getting Murray Haver from Hamilton and a third pilot (whose name\nescapes me) to carry out the caper. In reflection it now seems like an\nappropriate Air Force gesture for which the erks (infantrymen) would be most\nappreciative. By the time I got down to 5,000 the welcoming from the Rodney\nwas hardly inviting but sure enough there was the strip. Wheels down and in we\ngo, three Spits with 90-gallon jet tanks fully loaded with cool beer.\n\n## Read More: Weird He 119 Carried its Crew Inside the Nose\n\n\u201cAs I rolled to the end of the mesh runway it was hard to figure ... there was\nabsolutely no one in sight. What do we do now, I wondered, we can\u2019t just sit\nhere and wait for someone to show up. What\u2019s with the communications? Finally\nI saw someone peering out at us from behind a tree and I waved frantically to\nget him out to the aircraft. Sure enough out bounds this army type and he\nclimbs onto the wing with the welcome: \u2018What the hell are you doing here?\u2019\nWhereupon he got a short, but nevertheless terse, version of the story.\n\n\u201c\u2018Look,\u2019 he said, \u2018can you see that church steeple at the far end of the\nstrip? Well it\u2019s loaded with German snipers and we\u2019ve been all day trying to\nclear them out so you better drop your tanks and bugger off before it\u2019s too\nlate.\u2019 In moments we were out of there, but such was the welcoming for the\nfirst Spitfire at our B4 airstrip in Normandy.\u201d\n\n## Hawker Typhoon\n\nOn June 17, 1944, eleven days into the invasion and four days subsequent to\nBerryman\u2019s arrival, a Spitfire from the 416 Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air\nForce made the journey from England to the freshly constructed airstrip at\nBazenville, a mere three miles from Gold Beach.\n\nThe Typhoon Mk.1B used four 20mm cannons and also carried beer...\n\nThe aircraft arrived with a drop tank repurposed to carry beer, affixed\nbeneath its body. Despite being thoroughly steam-cleaned beforehand, the beer\nunfortunately retained a petrol flavor, as recounted by Dan Noonan, a Flight\nCommander with the 416 Squadron.\n\nThe robust Hawker Typhoon, capable of carrying a greater load, became another\ncourier for the RAF\u2019s thirst-quenching missions.\n\n## Read More: Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII, The largest Aircraft in WW1\n\nPilots from the RAF\u2019s 123 Wing, which operated rocket-firing Typhoons and was\nstationed from July 19, 1944, at Martragny, just east of Bayeux, would embark\non quick hops to Shoreham, 110 miles distant. There, a local brewery would\nfill two 90-gallon drop tanks fixed beneath the Typhoon\u2019s wings with beer.\n\nThe pilots would then dash back over the Channel, delivering the beer to\neagerly waiting RAF personnel at Martragny, who made sure to consume it\npromptly.\n\nA Spitfire with its D-Day stripes, and beer barrels.\n\nGroup Captain Desmond Scott, the New Zealand-born RAF ace and commander of the\n123 Wing, noted that while the beer acquired a slightly metallic taste during\ntransit, it was nonetheless rapidly consumed by the squadron.\n\nCrossing the channel at altitudes of around 15,000 feet had the added benefit\nof chilling the beer, making it refreshingly cool upon arrival.\n\nNewspaper accounts even detailed that Spitfires, using jettison tanks\nfashioned from vulcanised paper fibre, supplied beer shortly after D-Day.\n\n## Read More: He 280 Germany\u2019s First Jet Fighter\n\nAdditionally, it was reported that P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, likely operated\nby the USAAF, had transported iced custard or ice cream in their drop tanks to\nthe troops on the Normandy beaches, arriving \u201ciced in perfect condition\u201d\nthanks to the high-altitude flight. This wasn\u2019t as far-fetched as it might\nsound, given that the US military had its own mobile ice cream-making machines\nduring the war, as did many US Navy ships.\n\nOn a ship during WWII, two officers were trying to pull rank to cut in line\nfor ice cream when someone barked at them to wait their turn. They turned to\nsee who had dared to rebuke them and saw ADM Halsey waiting in line with the\nrest of the sailors.\n\nThe daring ventures of the Typhoons were featured in Time Magazine on July 2,\n1944, with the article titled \u201cFlying Pubs\u201d:\n\nA great thirst attacked British troops rushing emergency landing strips to\ncompletion in the dust of Normandy. Thinking of luckier comrades guzzling in\ncountry estaminets and town bistros, the runway builders began to grouse. They\nwanted beer. They got it. Rocket-firing Typhoons, before going on to shoot up\nNazis, landed on the runways with auxiliary fuel tanks full of beer. Swarms of\nthe thirsty gathered round with enamel mugs. The first tank-fulls tasted bad\nbecause of the tank linings; this flavor was overcome by chemical means and\nlater loads were delicious. Just like the corner pub at home.\n\n## The Legend Johnie Johnson\n\nJust three days after D-Day, Wing Commander Johnnie Johnson and his 127 Wing,\ncomprising two Canadian squadrons, touched down at the freshly constructed\nairfield at St Croix-sur-Mer, known as B3, situated a mere mile and a half\nfrom the Normandy beaches.\n\nJohhnnie Johnson, relaxing in between sorties on the wing of his Spitfire in\nNormandy, c.June\u2013August 1944. His dog, Sally, is to the left.\n\nHaving endured days subsisting on canned military \u201ccompo\u201d rations, Johnson\nreached out for assistance to Arthur King, his favored landlord at the Unicorn\npub in Chichester.\n\nRead More: The NC.1071 Wanted to Fall Apart on Every Flight\n\nKing coordinated with the daily Anson flights that arrived at St Croix from\nTangmere carrying mail, newspapers, and spare parts, ensuring that additional\ncomforts like tomatoes, fresh lobsters, just-baked bread, and \u201ca reasonable\nsupply of stout\u201d were included on the Anson\u2019s journey, much to the delight of\nthe airmen.\n\n## Tax Issues\n\nAs word of this special arrangement found its way into the press, it wasn\u2019t\nlong before Arthur King received a visit from a Customs and Excise official.\nKing was cautioned that he would require an export license to continue these\ncross-Channel deliveries. This incident was later noted by Johnson in his\nmemoirs:\n\nSince its introduction to the Service in 1939, the versatile Spitfire had\nparticipated in many diverse roles ... Now it fulfilled yet another role,\nperhaps not so vital as some of the tasks it had undertaken in the past, but\nto us of supreme importance. Back in England some ingenious mind had modified\nthe bomb racks slung under each wing so that a small barrel of beer could be\ncarried instead of a 500-pound bomb. Daily, this modern version of the\nbrewers\u2019 dray flew across the Channel and alighted at St Croix. The beer\nsuffered no ill effects from its unorthodox journey and was more than welcome\nin our mess.\n\n## Last Orders Please\n\nOver time, systematic beer deliveries replaced the ad-hoc \u201cflying drays\u201d for\nthe troops. By November 1944, the government decreed that military personnel\noverseas were to receive an allotment equal to five percent of the UK\u2019s total\nbeer output.\n\nTrying there best to reduce the drag on those barrels as much as they can.\n\nThis meant that all robust \u201cexport\u201d beers, naturally conditioned beers with a\nshelf life of six weeks or more, and any beer suitable for pasteurization were\nto be directed to the forces\u2019 catering service, the Naafi. Concurrently,\nbreweries in the newly freed regions of France began contributing to the\neffort.\n\nBack home, however, beer shortages began to affect the civilian population.\nBreweries cited a lack of workforce, as women who had filled in for\nconscripted men were now being evacuated with their children due to the\nlooming threats of V1 and V2 rockets.\n\nRead More: France\u2019s NC.3021 Belph\u00e9gor Was Huge!\n\nThe Nottingham Evening Post described scenes of \u201cpanic drinking\u201d in some pubs,\nwith patrons hastily consuming their pints in fear of missing out.\n\nIn some areas, only mild ale was on offer, as the more durable bitter was\nreserved for soldiers. Many establishments had to limit their opening hours to\na mere hour and a half at midday and two hours in the evening due to the beer\nscarcity.\n\nThe beer shortage even impacted those working in agriculture. In August 1944,\nreports emerged that parts of Lincolnshire were so affected by the beer\ndrought that pubs announced they would not uphold the long-standing tradition\nof providing beer for the harvest season. Instead of the customary pints,\nharvest workers would be offered cups of tea....\n\n#### You may also like\n\n### The Evolution of the Horten Flying Wing\n\n### B-17 Wreck Exposed by Melting Glacier in Iceland\n\n### Savoia-Marchetti SM.92 \u2013 The Italian P-38\n\n### Messerschmitt Me 323 Gigant The Biggest Bird\n\n### G8N Renzan \u2013 Japan\u2019s Long-Range Colossus\n\n### SAB AB-20 Advanced Design Was its Downfall\n\n#### About The Author\n\n##### jo\n\n### Search\n\n### LATEST NEWS\n\n### About Us\n\nWe here at PlaneHistoria love to document, discuss, explain and simply ponder\nthe fascinating history of the many extreme, weird and wonderful aircraft to\nhave graced the skies since man first took flight in 1903.\n\n### planeHISTORIA SHOP \u2013 WE WILL HAVE SOMETHING THAT MAKES FOR A UNIQUE GIFT!\n\nOur unique designs come on T-Shirts, Hoodies, Caps, Mugs and more...\n\nProudly powered by WordPress | SociallyViral Theme by MyThemeShop.\n\nkeetcnjp\n\n", "frontpage": false}
