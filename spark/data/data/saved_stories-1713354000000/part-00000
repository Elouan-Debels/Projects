The\n> julia package links Stata to Julia as well. Users can transfer data between\n> Stata and Julia at high speed, issue Julia commands from Stata to analyze\n> and plot, and pass results back to Stata. Julia's econometric software\n> ecosystem is not as mature as Stata's or R's, or even Python's. But Julia is\n> an excellent environment for developing high-performance numerical\n> applications, which can then be called from many platforms. The boottest\n> program for wild bootstrap-based inference (Roodman et al. 2019) can call a\n> Julia back end for a 33-50% speed-up, even as the R package fwildclusterboot\n> (Fischer and Roodman 2021) uses the same back end for inference after\n> instrumental variables estimation. reghdfejl mimics reghdfe (Correia 2016)\n> in fitting linear models with high-dimensional fixed effects but calls an\n> independently developed Julia package for tenfold acceleration on hard\n> problems. reghdfejl also supports nonlinear models--preliminarily, as the\n> Julia package for that purpose matures.\n\nSubjects:| Econometrics (econ.EM)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.09309 [econ.EM]  \n(or arXiv:2404.09309v2 [econ.EM] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.09309arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: David Roodman [view email] [v1] Sun, 14 Apr 2024 17:37:30 UTC (1,996 KB)\n[v2] Tue, 16 Apr 2024 15:26:19 UTC (1,996 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Julia as a universal platform for statistical\nsoftware development, by David Roodman\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\necon.EM\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2024-04\n\nChange to browse by:\n\necon\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
