Why\ndidn't he just write a HTML renderer for a FTP client?\n\nAsk Question\n\nAsked 2 days ago\n\nModified 2 days ago\n\nViewed 7k times\n\nThis question shows research effort; it is useful and clear\n\n33\n\nSave this question.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nMy beginning 'facts' in this question are:\n\n  1. HTTP is essentially nothing more than a file transfer protocol that only moves HTML.\n  2. Networked file transfer protocols were well established by 1991, were widely available on numerous platforms, including NeXTSTEP, and Tim would've known about them.\n  3. Browsers, while bundling an HTTP client for convenience, don't actually care how the HTML gets there, and will happily render HTML retrieved via FTP or any other method, particularly before the advent of CSS/JS/etc. Some browsers even have FTP support built in.\n\nSo with these above assumptions in place, why even bother with HTTP? It just\nseems like reinventing the wheel, when FTP was ripe to be made the underlying\ntransport for HTML data. Obviously FTP clients wouldn't have the ideal UX for\nTim's vision of the WWW, but it wouldn't have been difficult to customize a\nFTP client to work smoothly with HTML.\n\nI think we know now in hindsight that FTP probably wouldn't have been a good\nchoice especially at the global scale that the web has come to be, but I\nquestion whether Tim could've foreseen that. At the scale the internet was in\n1991 - FTP probably made sense.\n\nI'm sure one of my assumptions in this is faulty, which explains the existence\nof HTTP. Can someone shed some light here?\n\n  * history\n  * internet\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this question\n\nFollow this question to receive notifications\n\nasked 2 days ago\n\nrecursivedrecursived\n\n43322 silver badges55 bronze badges\n\nNew contributor\n\nrecursived is a new contributor to this site.

Compare that to requesting a single file from an FTP server.\n\n\u2013 Luaan\n\n22 hours ago\n\n| Show 10 more comments\n\n## 1 Answer 1\n\nReset to default\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n56\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nThe browser did, in fact, support retrieving pages over anonymous FTP from the\nbeginning, and it also supported other protocols. But, some of the early\ndocuments mention additional features for hypertext that would merit a new\nprotocol.\n\nThis document (by Tim Berners-Lee, from 1992 or earlier) lists some of the\ndesign goals for HTTP:\n\n> Why a new protocol?\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> The protocol we need for information access ( HTTP ) must provide\n>\n>   * A subset of the file transfer functionality\n>   * The ability to request an index search\n>   * Automatic format negotiation.\n>   * The ability to refer the client to another server\n>\n\nFTP only provides the first of these. HTTP provided file transfer and search\nvery early on, with the other ones implemented later.\n\nThis document (also by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992) also lists goals for the\nprotocol, among them:\n\n> Purpose\n>\n> When many sources of networked information are available to a reader, and\n> when a discipline of reference between different sources exists, it is\n> possible to rapidly follow references between units of information which are\n> provided at different remote locations. As response times should ideally be\n> of the order of 100ms in, for example, a hypertext jump, this requires a\n> fast, stateless, information retrieval protocol.\n\nFTP is a stateful protocol, and the whole design of the protocol is meant for\nbrowsing file hierarchies, not for jumping between pages on different servers\nas the web was meant to do.\n\nThere are probably other reasons that were considered, as well, but these seem\nto be the main ones for making a new protocol.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered 2 days ago\n\nuser24811user24811\n\n1,39722 gold badges88 silver badges1414 bronze badges\n\n7\n\n  * 8\n\nDon't know when these were introduced, but HTTP also brings multiple\nverbs/methods (GET/PUT/POST/DELETE etc.) and a lot of very flexible meta-data\nin the form of headers, both in the request and the response.\n\n\u2013 jcaron\n\nyesterday\n\n  * 8\n\n@jcaron added in the 1992 spec that became HTTP/1.0.

Basically, the thesis is a generalization and\nabstraction of what makes the WWW successful, but at the same time, Fielding\nhad been designing HTTP to be that protocol which drives the success of the\nWWW.
