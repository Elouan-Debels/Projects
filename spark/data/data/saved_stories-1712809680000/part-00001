And even if the particles don't escape from the region\nbut contribute to the curvature of spacetime, the resulting black hole isn't a\nKugelblitz anymore because it isn't formed from curvature produced solely by\nlight energy.\n\n  * quantum-mechanics\n  * particle-physics\n  * black-holes\n  * pair-production\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this question\n\nFollow this question to receive notifications\n\nedited Sep 4, 2018 at 8:56\n\nBaalateja Kataru\n\nasked Sep 4, 2018 at 8:40\n\nBaalateja KataruBaalateja Kataru\n\n19599 bronze badges\n\n8\n\n  * 1\n\n@nielsnielsen it literally means ball lightning but it's normally taken to\nmean a concentration of light so intense that it forms a black hole.

The particles travel slower than light, so\nthey'll leave the region slower than the photons that you're pumping in do. So\nthey should help the BH to form.\n\n\u2013 PM 2Ring\n\nSep 4, 2018 at 9:09\n\n  * 2\n\nJust because the light might be converted to matter by pair production would\nnot fundamentally alter the fact that the light created a black hole, even if\nit created some matter in the process. So I'd still say the term \"Kugelblitz\"\nis valid (and it sounds cool :-) ).\n\n\u2013 StephenG - Help Ukraine\n\nSep 4, 2018 at 9:25\n\n  * 1\n\nOnce an event horizon was formed (a black hole exists), there is no way to\ntell from the outside what is inside or what formed it. This is a result of\nthe no hair theorem.\n\n\u2013 StephenG - Help Ukraine\n\nSep 4, 2018 at 11:18\n\n| Show 3 more comments\n\n## 1 Answer 1\n\nReset to default\n\nThis answer is useful\n\n2\n\nSave this answer.\n\nShow activity on this post.\n\nYou just need to make your black hole very large. The (average) energy density\ninside a black hole decreases as 1/r2s1/r2s so if you make the Schwarzschild\nradius large enough you can form the black hole without needing EM amplitudes\nlarge enough to cause particle production.\n\nHaving said this, I don't think anyone is suggesting that you could actually\nmake a kugelblitz. The conditions needed are extreme to a ridiculous extent.\nThe idea is more of a thought experiment. There have been related calculations\nshowing that a black hole could be made from gravitational waves, which are\nalso massless radiation. However as with light this would never happen in\npractice.\n\nShare\n\nCC BY-SA 4.0\n\nImprove this answer\n\nFollow this answer to receive notifications\n\nanswered Sep 4, 2018 at 8:56\n\nJohn RennieJohn Rennie\n\n355k127127 gold badges762762 silver badges1k1k bronze badges\n\n1\n\n  * Ahh yes, that makes sense, kind of like dodging pair production or working around it by decreasing the energy density at a single region of space but the overall energy density remains the same because the increase in volume is compensated by more amount of light energy in the total volume.\n\n\u2013 Baalateja Kataru\n\nSep 4, 2018 at 9:01\n\nAdd a comment |\n\n##\n\nNot the answer you're looking for?
