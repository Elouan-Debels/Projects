Guy Golan told Fox11 that the eight-month-old was hit by oncoming\ntraffic in the middle of the road and died on the scene.\n\n\u201cAs the 9-year-old fell into the middle of the freeway, she injured herself\nand dropped the infant,\u201d Mr Golan said.\n\n\u201cAnd then, in a race to get out of the freeway and not get hit by traffic, the\nnine-year-old managed to get to the shoulder successfully, but the infant was\nstruck by traffic. And so the infant succumbed to her injuries in the middle\nof the freeway there.\u201d\n\nPolice were called to the 405 Freeway after two children were found on the\nroad (Fox 11)\n\nJohnson and her partner never had a history of domestic violence, police say\n(KCAL)\n\nJohnson then carried on driving, accelerating the vehicle to a speed in excess\nof 100 miles per hour, before crashing into a tree in the city of Redondo\nBeach at around 5am.\n\nJohnson died from her injuries.\n\nNow, the nine-year-old is the sole survivor of their mother\u2019s horrific killing\nspree.\n\nA few hours later, at around 7.35am, Chaney\u2019s body was found at the couple\u2019s\nhome when neighbours noticed that the front door was open.\n\nPolice said a neighbour went in to check on the family and found Chaney dead\nin the apartment.\n\nJohnson\u2019s X account was filled with apocalpse warnings and conspiracy theories\n(@MysticxLipstick/Twitter)\n\nA neighbour told ABC7 that she discovered the horrific scene when she spotted\na trail of blood leading to Johnson\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cTheir door was wide open, there was blood on the floor leading into their\napartment, and then a trail of it in the hallway leading up to the elevator,\nand I saw some blood on the walls,\u201d the unidentified neighbour said.\n\nPolice have not yet clarified what motivated Johnson to carry out the killing\nrampage.\n\nJohnson died after her car pummeled into a tree in Redondo Beach (Fox 11)\n\nMr Golan told The Associated Press that while investigators have reviewed her\nsocial media posts, they are not considering the eclipse to be a contributing\nfactor \u201cbecause we just don\u2019t know why she did what she did\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken all the facts we can, but without being able to interview her and\nwithout having something more tangible than a post on X, I don\u2019t know how much\nweight you can give to somebody (saying) there\u2019s an apocalypse and attribute\nit to one of the most horrific murders we\u2019ve had in LA,\u201d he added.\n\nLAPD investigators said that Chaney and Johnson had been dating for around\nthree years and were living together, with Mr Golan adding that there had been\nno prior incidence of domestic violence ever reported between the couple, CBS\nreported.\n\n### 1/7Influencer stabbed partner, threw children from car over solar eclipse\n\n### Influencer stabbed partner, threw children from car over solar eclipse\n\n@MysticxLipstick/Twitter\n\n### Influencer stabbed partner, threw children from car over solar eclipse\n\nDanielle Johnson is accused of stabbing her partner to death in their Los\nAngeles apartment\n\n@MysticxLipstick/Twitter\n\n### Influencer stabbed partner, threw children from car over solar eclipse\n\nPolice were called to the 405 Freeway after two children were found on the\nroad\n\nFox 11\n\n### Influencer stabbed partner, threw children from car over solar eclipse\n\nJohnson and her partner never had a history of domestic violence, police say\n\nKCAL\n\n### Influencer stabbed partner, threw children from car over solar eclipse\n\nJohnson\u2019s X account was filled with apocalpse warnings and conspiracy theories\n\n@MysticxLipstick/Twitter\n\n### Influencer stabbed partner, threw children from car over solar eclipse\n\nJohnson died after her car pummeled into a tree in Redondo Beach\n\nFox 11\n\n### Influencer stabbed partner, threw children from car over solar eclipse\n\nDanielle Johnson, 34, was a prominet astrology influencer who appeared worried\nabout the eclipse\n\n@MysticxLipstick/Twitter\n\n### Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference\nlater?
