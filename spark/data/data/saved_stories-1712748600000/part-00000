I'm better\nnow, but I absolutely see the appeal of Spirit City: Lofi Sessions, a\n\"gamified focus tool\" that just launched on Steam.\n\nSpirit City contains much of what I just mentioned above, allowing you to\ncreate your own lofi girl and/or boy, customise their appearance, and decorate\nthe swank studio apartment they're working within. It's then got built-in lofi\nmusic playlists; sound effect loops of rain, wind, a fireplace and more; a\npomodoro timer; and a todo list.\n\nGigantic: Rampage Edition is out now, offering a second chance to fans of the\nshuttered hero shooter\n\nRead more on Rock Paper Shotgun\n\nThe vibes are immaculate, as some other hack might say. I booted Spirit City\nup last night and it does absolutely nail the atmosphere, particularly when\ntweaking the sound effects can (optionally) also change the visuals. Who\ndoesn't want to imagine themselves sat in a window nook, overlooking a city,\nwith rain pattering against the glass?\n\nGamifying all of this is where the \"spirit\" part comes in. Your study buddy's\nstudy buddy is a fantasy creature called Lenny, who looks like a cat with a\nthird eye. Lenny can be replaced with other similarly cute creatures, unlocked\nin your Spiritdex as you level up by completing todo list items or fiddling\nwith customisation options.\n\nIf I'm honest, I can't imagine Spirit City fitting into my life. My todo lists\nlive within Obsidian and sync across devices, and I too often shirk lofi beats\nin favour of other music genres to chill/study to. I admire it a lot, though,\nas a neat idea that seems to nail exactly what it sets out to do.\n\nSpirit City: Lofi Sessions costs \u00a38/\u20ac9.43/$9.59 from Steam.\n\nNow someone make a similar tool which is actually a horror game or murder\nmystery in disguise. Email me when it's done.\n\n## Are you excited for GTA 6?\n\n79,888 votes\n\nRock Paper Shotgun is the home of PC gaming\n\nSign in and join us on our journey to discover strange and compelling PC\ngames.\n\nSign in with Google Sign in with Facebook Sign in with Twitter Sign in with\nReddit\n\nSign in with email\n\nIn this article\n\nAwaiting cover image\n\nSpirit City: Lofi Sessions\n\nVideo Game\n\nRelated topics\n\nIndie Indiescovery Mooncube Games\n\nAbout the Author\n\nGraham Smith\n\nDeputy Editorial Director\n\nRock Paper Shotgun's former editor-in-chief and current corporate dad.
