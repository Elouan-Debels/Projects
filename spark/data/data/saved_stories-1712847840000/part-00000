Spacesuit on, my helmet gleams bright, Pedal to the stars, a fantastical\nflight. Chorus Cycling on the moon, gravity's a thrill, Floating over rocks,\nweightless and still. The Earth a blue marble, hanging so small, Space is my\nplayground, I'll conquer it all. Verse 2 Up a dusty dune, tires kicking wide,\nA comet streaks by, my cosmic ride. Weightless jumps, and lunar spins, A dance\nwith the universe, my adventure begins. Chorus Cycling on the moon, gravity's\na thrill, Floating over rocks, weightless and still. The Earth a blue marble,\nhanging so small, Space is my playground, I'll conquer it all. Bridge See the\nMilky Way, a diamond-studded stream, This lunar bike ride, a far-out dream.\nSunlight on my visor, shadows so deep, A space-age odyssey, where wonders\nwon't sleep Chorus Cycling on the moon, gravity's a thrill, Floating over\nrocks, weightless and still. The Earth a blue marble, hanging so small, Space\nis my playground, I'll conquer it all. Outro Moon dust swirls, my journey\ncomplete, A cosmic two-wheeler, I can't be beat! Lunar cycling champion, out\nof this world, With stars in my eyes, my flag unfurled.\n\n## cycling on the moon\n\ndance number, pop style,\n\nv3\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nVerse 1 No roads or trails, just craters and dust, A lunar landscape, a cosmic\nmust.
