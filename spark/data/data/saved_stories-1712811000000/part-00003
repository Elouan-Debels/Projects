It\u2019s the first successful reversal of a Kei ban since\nthe American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators told states to ban\nimported vehicles in 2021. The Texas DMV has begun circulating documents to\ncounty tax assessors-collectors and dealerships stating that these vehicles\ncan be titled and registered for use on Texas roadways. This rule change puts\nTexas ahead of many states, so let\u2019s take a look.\n\nBefore I continue, I would like to clarify our previous entry on the Texas\nbattle for Kei trucks. Many states have had Kei truck bans on their books for\nlong before the AAMVA issued its new guidance. For example, Wisconsin law\nspecifically calls out Kei cars as a type of vehicle that cannot be registered\nand it has been like that for over a decade. Likewise, in 2019, enthusiasts in\nNorth Carolina successfully legalized Kei trucks in that state. Wisconsin has\na \u201cloophole\u201d to its law, where you could register a non-compliant vehicle as a\ncollector car.\n\n2025 Toyota 4Runner Walkaround\n\nTexas is the first state to win the battle for Kei trucks after the AAMVA\nissued its latest and most destructive recommendations in 2021. Those\nrecommendations have led to the nightmares so many enthusiasts in an\nincreasing number of states are facing right now. Texans have been trying to\nget their state to legalize Kei trucks for well over a decade, so this win is\nincredible.\n\nAlek Roman/Texas Kei Truck Advocates\n\nIf you\u2019re new to this story, I\u2019ll bring you up to speed on what\u2019s going on.\nFeel free to click here and here for two deep dives on how we got here.\n\n## States Control What Drives On Their Roads\n\nCar enthusiasts in the United States are hampered by what is known as the \u201c25\nYear Rule.\u201d To put it in layperson\u2019s terms, the federal government has strict\nrules on how vehicles can be imported into the country. Those vehicles have to\ncomply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards as well as the EPA\u2019s\nemissions standards that applied to domestically-sold vehicles built at the\nsame time as the imported vehicles. This is an expensive process and cannot be\ndone by regular people, rather by outfits certified for the job.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf a vehicle is non-compliant with safety and emissions regulations, it has to\nbe at least 25 years old before the regulations no longer apply. Then you can\nimport your favorite car without an expensive headache. Also, that\u2019s 25 years\nfrom the vehicle\u2019s manufacturing date, not its model year.\n\nUnfortunately, some states have made realizing dreams a bit difficult. While\nthe federal government is perfectly okay with you importing a 26-year-old\nJapanese Kei truck, whether your state is okay with it is a different story.\nThe states reserve the right to determine what vehicles are legal to drive on\ntheir roads, and many states have decided that any Kei vehicle is not legal\nfor road use.\n\nAlek Roman/Texas Kei Truck Advocates\n\nThis has been a problem in several states for years. However, the American\nAssociation of Motor Vehicle Administrators kicked the nightmare into high\ngear. The AAMVA is an entity we are actively researching. For now, here\u2019s what\nyou need to know from one of my previous pieces:\n\n> The AAMVA is a non-governmental non-profit lobbying organization composed of\n> motor vehicle administrators, law enforcement administrators, and executives\n> from all 50 states, Canada, Mexico, the Virgin Islands, and Washington D.C.\n> Among other things, the organization seeks standardization of laws across\n> member states regarding traffic safety, vehicle titling, and driver\n> licensing. AAMVA does not have legislative power but it does urge all member\n> states to follow its \u201cbest practices.\u201d\n>\n> The AAMVA has been studying Japanese and Chinese Kei vehicles since at least\n> the late 2000s. Back then, the AAMVA didn\u2019t really know how to handle the\n> flood of cheap 25 mph speed-limited off-road utility trucks that came in\n> from China. The answer came courtesy of an Insurance Institute for Highway\n> Safety opinion published in 2010. The IIHS crash-tested a Kei truck against\n> a Ford Ranger and concluded that low-speed vehicles and mini trucks are\n> unsafe and should be removed from the road.\n>\n> From that point forward, the AAMVA has advocated against allowing Kei trucks\n> from being allowed on state roads. In 2021, this guidance went even further,\n> essentially telling states to ban any vehicle that doesn\u2019t meet FMVSS. The\n> AAMVA was serious about this, stating in its documentation that if banning a\n> vehicle ran afoul state law, it urged lawmakers to change the laws until the\n> ban became legal.\n\nAAMVA\n\nThe AAMVA\u2019s 2021 guidance is its most destructive yet. In the past, the AAMVA\nfocused on Kei trucks. However, its latest guidance advises states to remove\nany vehicle that doesn\u2019t meet FMVSS. Further, the AAMVA says if a state finds\nthe guidance to be illegal, the states should just change their laws until\nit\u2019s legal.\n\nThis guidance is why enthusiasts in Maine, Rhode Island, Georgia,\nPennsylvania, New York, and potentially other states are hurting right now.\nThe sad part is that some states may have even had rules against Kei vehicles\nin the past, but sometimes they were not enforced or not enforced well. The\nAAMVA reminded those states to enforce the rules they already had or to create\nnew rules.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## Enthusiasts Fight Back...\n\nMercedes Streeter\n\nEnthusiasts have been challenging the AAMVA\u2019s guidance and the resulting bans,\nfrom individual DMV appeals in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island to a lawsuit in\nGeorgia. I\u2019m told that Georgia\u2019s Kei enthusiasts also attempted to work with\ntheir lawmakers, but it didn\u2019t bring success. One Maine lawmaker even\nintroduced a bill that would have reversed the ban in that state. Sadly, that\nbill didn\u2019t get traction and died off. Some people have gotten small victories\nin individual appeals, but these states have not budged since the AAMVA\u2019s\nlatest guidance. That changed with Texas.\n\nI spoke with David from the Texas Kei Truck Advocates, and he informed me that\nKei trucks had effectively been banned from Texas since 2010 after HB4495, a\nbill that would have legalized Kei trucks, failed to become law. Despite that,\nsome Texas Kei truck owners still had good luck getting a title and plates. It\nwasn\u2019t bulletproof, as many DMV offices still refused to register Kei trucks;\nKei trucks were technically illegal, but people still got plates, anyway. In\nrecent times, Kei truck enthusiasts in Texas have been reporting the letters\nthey received from the Texas DMV stating that their vehicles were not eligible\nfor title and registration. Here\u2019s a clipping from the January 2024 edition of\nthe Texas Vehicle Title Manual:\n\nTXDMV\n\nTexas decided to do something different.\n\nMany Texans were still able to have Kei trucks titled and registered, so the\nTexas Kei Truck Advocates could have just done nothing and maintained the\nstatus quo. David told me some people felt that the Texas Kei Truck Advocates\nshouldn\u2019t rock the boat. However, it\u2019s hard not to see what\u2019s happening in\nMaine and Georgia and not worry. Both of these states have decided to not only\nprevent the registration of imported vehicles, but they\u2019ve also decided to\nrevoke the titles of vehicles that were already registered. Enthusiasts in\nthose states are stuck with what are effectively pretty paperweights.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf you wanted to buy a Kei truck and lived in Texas, you might have thought\ntwice because what if Texas also started revoking titles? The Texas Kei Truck\nAdvocates wanted to get ahead of the situation by working to legalize Kei\ntrucks before the possibility of the state deciding to revoke existing titles.\n\nDavid explained to me that the Texas Kei enthusiasts contacted and\ncollaborated with their lawmakers all over the state, even reaching the top at\nthe office of Governor Greg Abbott. They also contacted the Texas DMV,\npresenting solid arguments for why Kei trucks should be legal. The Texas Kei\nTruck Advocates approached the DMV armed with a multi-page document (click\nhere) explaining what Kei trucks are, how they\u2019re different than 25 mph-\nlimited mini trucks, how the trucks are federally legal, and how banning these\nvehicles would negatively impact small businesses in the state.\n\nThe Texas DMV listened and agreed to review its policy banning Kei trucks.\nLawmakers contacted by the Texas Kei Truck Advocates and by The Autopian also\ngave their helping hands to the cause. David admitted that this was risky. It\nwas possible that all of this hard work could have resulted in the Texas DMV\nrealizing that its county offices weren\u2019t following the rules. The impact\nwould have been a full ban. Something somewhat similar happened in Georgia\nwhen that state realized that some counties were still registering Kei\nvehicles.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n## ...And Win\n\nIn a surprising twist, Texas didn\u2019t clamp down on Kei trucks. Instead, its DMV\ndecided to completely reverse its ban on Kei trucks. Now, a Honda Acty is just\nas legal in Texas as a Smart Fortwo. Our first solid confirmation of the\nchange came from Texas State Representative Gene Wu, the Representative\noriginally contacted by The Autopian.\n\nRepresentative Gene Wu\n\nNot long after the confirmation of the changes, the Texas DMV started sending\nletters to its offices, advising that Kei trucks will now be considered real\nmotor vehicles and not off-road toys. Check it out:\n\nI know the text might be too small on mobile, so click here to read the whole\ndocument. The first two paragraphs are the most important:\n\n> A mini vehicle includes a mini car, truck, van, and bus manufactured in a\n> foreign country, most commonly in Japan, China, and India. The department\n> previously determined mini vehicles were not eligible for title or\n> registration. The department has re-evaluated the current policy and\n> conferred with the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) regarding safety\n> considerations and inspection requirements. DPS determined that if the\n> vehicle passes current inspection requirements the vehicle can be registered\n> and operated on public roadways. As a result, the department has revised the\n> titling and registration requirements for these vehicles.\n>\n> Effective immediately, mini vehicles are required to be titled and must be\n> registered if operated on public roadways...\n\nWhat happened here? A number of states that have banned Kei vehicles didn\u2019t\nactually codify it in law but rather as a DMV policy. While states like Maine\nchanged their laws to exclude imports, some states, like Rhode Island, didn\u2019t\nchange any laws and instead just reinterpreted existing laws. I couldn\u2019t find\na Texas law that specifically banned Kei trucks, but Texas did have a\nlongstanding department policy that effectively banned Kei trucks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo, Texans didn\u2019t have to get a law changed. Instead, they had to convince the\nstate government to reverse its policy. That\u2019s not to diminish the achievement\nhere, because what Texas won is still incredible. Now, Texans can confidently\nregister a Kei truck as they would any other car. That truck can then drive on\nTexas roads just like any other car.\n\nTexas Kei Truck Advocates\n\nHowever, there is one more problem that I did not mention in the last piece.\nBecause this was done through a policy, it also means that a future Texas\ngovernment could, in theory, reinstate the Kei truck ban. So, the Texas Kei\nTruck Advocates aren\u2019t done yet. Now, they will continue to advocate for Kei\ntrucks through education while also fighting to get a law on the books\nlegalizing imports like Kei trucks.\n\nThe Texas win is also spreading across America. I\u2019m told advocacy group\nchapters are sprouting up in Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Maine. These groups\nwill be following the Texas lead of fighting for change by motivating\nlawmakers. We\u2019ll be watching their progress and hopefully, enthusiasts can\nreplicate the success found in North Carolina in 2019 and Texas today.\n\nI\u2019ve reached out to the AAMVA for comment on Texas, as well as its guidance on\nimported vehicle bans. I will update if I hear back.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n  * These Three Easy Fixes Transformed My 2002 Audi S4.
