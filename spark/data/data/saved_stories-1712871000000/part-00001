But on Thursday, it said students applying to the\ncollege for fall 2025 admission \u2014 hoping to join the graduating class of 2029\n\u2014 will now have to submit standardized test scores as part of their admissions\npackage.\n\nHarvard becomes the latest Ivy League school to reinstate the requirement\nafter making the choice optional during the pandemic. Dartmouth College, Yale\nand Brown universities announced similar changes in recent weeks, after\nofficials cited data suggesting that SAT and ACT scores were the best\npredictors of students\u2019 academic performance at their schools \u2014 and that\nmaking the tests optional could further disadvantage applicants from more\nchallenging backgrounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStandardized tests have been debated for decades, with critics saying they\nadded a roadblock for disadvantaged students, among other concerns. When the\ncoronavirus pandemic shut down testing sites across the country, many colleges\nmade the tests optional, and then continued to provide flexibility as they\nstudied the issue.\n\nThe changes are another pivot in an unusually tumultuous time for selective\ncollege admissions amid fallout from last year\u2019s Supreme Court ruling on\naffirmative action, and a disastrous rollout of a new federal financial aid\nform.\n\nStandardized tests are just one part of a package of information applicants\nsend, including grades, essays, and recommendation letters. But millions of\nstudents study for, take, and retake the tests in hopes of optimizing their\nscores.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn announcing its decision Thursday, university officials cited research by\nHarvard professors Raj Chetty and David J. Deming, and co-author John N.\nFriedman of Brown University, who used data from hundreds of universities and\nmore than 3 million undergraduate students per year to explore socioeconomic\ndiversity and admissions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCritics correctly note that standardized tests are not an unbiased measure of\nstudents\u2019 qualifications, as students from higher-income families often have\ngreater access to test prep and other resources,\u201d Chetty said in a statement\nThursday. \u201cBut the data reveal that other measures \u2014 recommendation letters,\nextracurriculars, essays \u2014 are even more prone to such biases. Considering\nstandardized test scores is likely to make the admissions process at Harvard\nmore meritocratic while increasing socioeconomic diversity.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cexceptional cases\u201d when applicants are unable to take the SAT or ACT, the\nschool will accept certain other scores, including AP and IB tests. The policy\nwill be formally assessed at regular intervals, school officials said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHarvard\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Hopi Hoekstra said the tests are a\nmeans for all students, regardless of their background and life experience, to\nprovide information predictive of success in college and beyond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIndeed, when students have the option of not submitting their test scores,\u201d\nHoekstra said in a statement, \u201cthey may choose to withhold information that,\nwhen interpreted by the admissions committee in the context of the local norms\nof their school, could have potentially helped their application. In short,\nmore information, especially such strongly predictive information, is valuable\nfor identifying talent from across the socioeconomic range.\u201d\n\nOther highly selective schools remain test-optional, including the University\nof Chicago, Columbia University, and the University of Pennsylvania, which\nannounced last month that it would not require the scores for the 2024-25\napplication cycle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nOpinions from our Editorial Board\n\nViews from The Post\u2019s Editorial Board on current events\n\nOpinion|A new March Madness?
