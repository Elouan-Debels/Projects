Initially created to enrich\nmy portfolio, I've achieved what I wanted from it and now aim to give back to\nthe community. This engine is now a hub for learning, with the mission of\ncollaboration and connection. It offers exclusive perks like contributor\nrecognition, networking opportunities with tech professionals, and learning\nresources, including an active Discord community and insightful YouTube\nvideos. Beyond just coding, Spartan is about building a uniquely supportive\ncommunity.\n\n  * For occasional updates regarding the project's development, you can follow me on X.\n\n  * For project and general discussions, join our community of 350+ members on discord.\n\n  * For issues and anything directly related to the project, feel free to open an issue.\n\n  * Meet my AI replica, combining my engine experience and personality, click here for assistance.\n\n  * Please adhere to the MIT license.

Each world is physics-enabled, allowing you to walk around,\npick objects using your mouse, and even drive a car. These worlds are designed\nto offer a diverse and enjoyable experience.\n\nSponza| Forest  \n---|---  \nThe Sponza building, found in Dubrovnik, is showcased here with a true-to-life\nscale.| A height map-generated forest featuring water bodies amidst tens of\nthousands of trees and plants, all set in a walkable terrain.  \nCar| Doom  \nA drivable car implemented with a highly realistic tire friction formula,\nsimulation of gearbox, anti-roll bar, and more.| This is a simple scene with\nthe soundtrack from E1M1  \n  \n# Features\n\n#### Rendering\n\n  * Cutting edge Vulkan renderer.\n  * 128-byte push constant buffer for lightning fast CPU to GPU data transfer.\n  * On the fly GPU-based mip generation - with only one dispatch.\n  * Fully bindless design (materials, lights, even the samplers).\n  * Vulkan (main) and DirectX 12 (wip) backends with universal HLSL shaders.\n  * Unified deferred rendering with transparency (BSDF with same render path).\n  * Atmospheric scattering, real-time filtering and image-based lighting.\n  * Screen space shadows from Bend Studio's Days Gone.\n  * Screen space global illumination & reflections.\n  * Variable rate shading.\n  * Dynamic resolution scaling.\n  * Advanced shadow features with penumbra and colored translucency.\n  * Physical light units (intensity from lumens and color from kelvin).\n  * Frustum & occlusion culling (software and hardware hybrid).\n  * Physically based camera.\n  * Volumetric fog.\n  * Temporal anti-aliasing.\n  * HDR10 output.\n  * Post-process effects like fxaa, bloom, motion-blur, depth of field, chromatic aberration etc.\n  * AMD FidelityFX features like FSR 2, SPD, etc.\n  * Comprehensive debug rendering options.\n\n#### General\n\n  * One-click project generation for easy setup.\n  * Universal input support, including mouse, keyboard, and controllers (tested with a PS5 controller).\n  * Comprehensive physics features.\n  * CPU & GPU profiling.\n  * XML support for data handling.\n  * Thread pool that can consume any workload.\n  * Entity-component, event systems and most things you'll expect to find in a modern engine.\n  * Wide file format support: 10+ for fonts, 20+ for audio, 30+ for images, and 40+ for models.\n\n# Wiki\n\nThe wiki can answer most of your questions, here are some of it's contents:\n\n  * Compiling\n  * Contributing\n  * Perks of a contributor\n\nQuestions can also be answered by my AI replica, Panos.\n\n# Interesting facts\n\n  * It's one of the most complete, oldest, yet still active, one man game engines out there.\n  * It's one of the most rewarding projects in terms of the perks you receive should you become a contributor, more here.\n  * This engine started as a way to enrich my portfolio while I was a university student, circa 2015.\n\n# Use cases\n\nAre you utilizing any components from the Spartan Engine, or has it inspired\naspects of your work?
