When these protons\ncollide with the nucleus of a boron atom, the atom undergoes fusion,\ntransforming into a high-energy form of carbon that rapidly decays into three\nalpha particles.\n\nBy introducing boron into the thruster\u2019s exhaust, the FireStar Drive enables\nthis fusion process. Similar to the way an afterburner enhances thrust in a\njet engine by introducing fuel into the exhaust, the fusion occurring in the\nthruster\u2019s exhaust significantly improves its performance.\n\nThe fusion process was first devised during a R&D program for the US Air\nForce\u2019s AFWERX (Air Force Work Project) initiative, where boronated water was\nintroduced into the pulsed plasma thruster\u2019s exhaust plume. This created alpha\nparticles and gamma rays, clear indications of nuclear fusion.\n\nThe process has now been further validated during subsequent testing at the\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\u2019s High Power Electric Propulsion Laboratory\n(HPEPL) in Atlanta, USA. During the tests the process was seen to create the\nionizing radiation and improve the base propulsion unit\u2019s thrust by 50%, said\nRocketStar.\n\nAdam Hecht, professor of nuclear engineering at the University of New Mexico\nsaid, \u201cRocketStar has not just incrementally improved a propulsion system, but\ntaken a leap forward by applying a novel concept, creating a fusion-fission\nreaction in the exhaust. This is an exciting time in technology development,\nand I am looking forward to their future innovations.\u201d\n\nChris Craddock, CEO of RocketStar said, \u201cWe are thrilled at the results of our\ninitial testing on an idea that our team has been exploring for some time. On\na napkin at a conference in Florida, I sketched this idea out and described it\nto Wes Faler, the founder of Miles Space. He was quite clever in developing\nboth the base thruster and the fusion enhancement.\n\n\u201cWe acquired Miles Space and Faler is now our CTO. So now I\u2019m excited to take\nour already stellar thruster and make it fusion-enhanced with remarkable\nimprovements in performance. Thanks to AFWERX and the USSF [United States\nSpace Force] for believing it was possible!\u201d\n\nPlans to test the FireStar Drive include further ground testing this year with\nan in-space demonstration scheduled for February 2025 as a hosted payload on\nspace robotics firm Rogue Space System\u2019s Barry-2 spacecraft. \u201cWe are very\nexcited to test FireStar for RocketStar,\u201d said Brent Abbott, CRO at Rogue\nSpace Systems. \u201cWe look forward to considering it for future Rogue missions.\u201d\n\nShare.
