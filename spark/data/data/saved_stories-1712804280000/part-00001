Software in the Public Interest (SPI) is a non-profit corporation\nfounded to act as a fiscal sponsor for organizations that develop open source\nsoftware and hardware. It provides services such as accepting donations,\nholding funds and assets, ... SPI qualifies for 501(c)(3) (U.S. non-profit\norganization) status. This means that all donations made to SPI and its\nsupported projects are tax deductible for donors in the United States. Read on\nfor more details...\n\n## Questions & Answers\n\n### Why become an SPI Associated Project?\n\nGentoo Linux, as a collective of software developers, is pretty good at being\na Linux distribution. However, becoming a US federal non-profit organization\nwould increase the non-technical workload.\n\nThe current Gentoo Foundation has bylaws restricting its behavior to that of a\nnon-profit, is a recognized non-profit only in New Mexico, but a for-profit\nentity at the US federal level. A direct conversion to a federally recognized\nnon-profit would be unlikely to succeed without significant effort and cost.\n\nFinding Gentoo Foundation trustees to take care of the non-technical work is\nan ongoing challenge. Robin Johnson (robbat2), our current Gentoo Foundation\ntreasurer, spent a huge amount of time and effort with getting bookkeeping and\ntaxes in order after the prior treasurers lost interest and retired from\nGentoo.\n\nFor these reasons, Gentoo is moving the non-technical organization overhead to\nSoftware in the Public Interest (SPI). As noted above, SPI is already now\nrecognized at US federal level as a full-fleged non-profit 501(c)(3). It also\nhandles several projects of similar type and size (e.g., Arch and Debian) and\nas such has exactly the experience and background that Gentoo needs.\n\n### What are the advantages of becoming an SPI Associated Project in detail?\n\nFinancial benefits to donors:\n\n  * tax deductions [1]\n\nFinancial benefits to Gentoo:\n\n  * matching fund programs [2]\n  * reduced organizational complexity\n  * reduced administration costs [3]\n  * reduced taxes [4]\n  * reduced fees [5]\n  * increased access to non-profit-only sponsorship [6]\n\nNon-financial benefits to Gentoo:\n\n  * reduced organizational complexity, no \u201cdouble-headed beast\u201d any more\n  * less non-technical work required\n\n[1] Presently, almost no donations to the Gentoo Foundation provide a tax\nbenefit for donors anywhere in the world. Becoming a SPI Associated Project\nenables tax benefits for donors located in the USA. Some other countries do\nrecognize donations made to non-profits in other jurisdictions and provide\nsimilar tax credits.\n\n[2] This also depends on jurisdictions and local tax laws of the donor, and is\noften tied to tax deductions.\n\n[3] The Gentoo Foundation currently pays $1500/year in tax preparation costs.\n\n[4] In recent fiscal years, through careful budgetary planning on the part of\nthe Treasurer and advice of tax professionals, the Gentoo Foundation has used\ndepreciation expenses to offset taxes owing; however, this is not a\nsustainable strategy.\n\n[5] Non-profits are eligible for reduced fees, e.g., of Paypal (savings of\n0.9-1.29% per donation) and other services.\n\n[6] Some sponsorship programs are only available to verified 501(c)(3)\norganizations\n\n### Can I still donate to Gentoo, and how?\n\nYes, of course, and please do so! For the start, you can go to SPI\u2019s Gentoo\npage and scroll down to the Paypal and Click&Pledge donation links. More\ninformation and more ways will be set up soon. Keep in mind, donations to\nGentoo via SPI are tax-deductible in the US!\n\nIn time, Gentoo will contact existing recurring donors, to aid transitions to\nSPI\u2019s donation systems.\n\n### What will happen to the Gentoo Foundation?\n\nOur intention is to eventually transfer the existing assets to SPI and\ndissolve the Gentoo Foundation. The precise steps needed on the way to this\nobjective are still under discussion.\n\n### Does this affect in any way the European Gentoo e.V.?\n\nNo. F\u00f6rderverein Gentoo e.V. will continue to exist independently. It is also\nrecognized to serve public-benefit purposes (\u00a7 52 Fiscal Code of Germany),\nmeaning that donations are tax-deductible in the E.U.\n\n### Questions or comments?\n\nPlease feel free to contact us.\n\n### Home\n\n  * Debug\n  * News\n\n### Get Started\n\n  * About Gentoo\n  * Philosophy\n  * Screenshots\n  * FAQ\n\n### Downloads\n\n  * Mirrors\n  * Signatures\n\n### Inside Gentoo\n\n  * Developers\n  * Projects\n  * GLEPs\n  * Artwork\n  * Gentoo Foundation\n  * Sponsors\n  * Stores\n  * Contact\n\n### Support\n\n  * Consulting\n  * Documentation\n  * Package database\n  * Repository news items\n  * Security\n  * USE flags\n  * rsync mirrors\n\n### Get Involved\n\n  * IRC channels\n  * Forums\n  * Mailing lists\n  * Contribute\n  * Become a developer\n  * Get the code\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\u00a9 2001-2024 Gentoo Authors Gentoo is a trademark of the Gentoo Foundation,\nInc. and of F\u00f6rderverein Gentoo e.V.
