The first AI that you can talk to, and that talks back, running\nlocally with no internet connection so your conversations and data are\ncompletely secure. No account, setup, or subscription are needed, just plug in\nthe box and start chatting.\n\n## Live Captions\n\nNeed closed captions for a live event, or just to help in situations where you\nhave trouble hearing a conversation? We\u2019re using the latest in AI technology\nto display subtitles based on the audio input, which are output on the built-\nin display and through an HDMI connector for external monitors or screens.\n\n## Conversational AI\n\nWant answers to questions, jokes, stories, or just want to chat to pass the\ntime? AI in a Box lets you talk to a large language model (LLM) running\nlocally on the device, and it will talk back. Get the power of modern AI on\nyour coffee table, all with no setup or API fees.\n\n## Live Translation\n\nTranslate between multiple major languages on the fly. Select the source and\ndestination languages and you\u2019ll see split-screen captions showing the\noriginal input and the results of machine translation.\n\n## Air-Gapped Privacy\n\nThe software itself runs entirely locally, so no information is ever shared\noutside of the device. With no Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity, the only way\nto access the device is by plugging in a physical keyboard or an Ethernet\ncable. This removes the possibility of remote attacks, and makes it suitable\nfor use with sensitive conversations or material.\n\n## Voice Keyboard\n\nAttach a USB Type-C data cable (not supplied) to any device that can take\nkeyboard input, and the content of any nearby conversations will be entered as\nkeystrokes, as if they were being dictated. This allows the box to become part\nof a larger system, for example by connecting to a Raspberry Pi that takes in\nthe transcript and controls a robot or sculpture based on the content.\n\n## Open Source\n\nAI in a Box is built on a foundation of open source models like Whisper and\nLlama2. In the same vein, we are releasing all the code to accelerate and\ncontrol the system under an open source license. You can already see our\nlibrary for optimized transformer inference on the RockChip NPU. This\ntransparency should help with security and privacy auditing, and will allow\ndevelopers to use the system as a base to build their own real-time voice\ninput applications in Python.\n\n## Features and Specifications\n\n  * RockChip 3588S SoC with NPU\n  * 8 GB DRAM\n  * Built-in display, speakers, and microphone\n  * Custom enclosure\n  * Ubuntu 22.04 OS\n\n## Support & Documentation\n\n  * GitHub documentation\n\n# In the Press\n\n# Ask a Question\n\nAsk Crowd Supply about an order Ask Useful Sensors a technical question Submit\na field report about how you used this project\n\nProduced by Useful Sensors in Mountain View, CA.\n\nSold and shipped by Crowd Supply.\n\n### AI in a Box\n\nThis all-in-one, pre-assembled box is ready to start listening and talking as\nsoon as you plug in power.
