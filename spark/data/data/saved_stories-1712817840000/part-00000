Today\u2019s may well have been the longest-range aerial strike launched\nby Ukraine so far and it appears to have involved a previously unseen drone\nthat was converted from a light manned aircraft.\n\nA video that appeared today on social media shows the improvised drone coming\nin low and slamming into a building, resulting in a huge fireball.\n\nThe intended target was purportedly the Shahed production facility in\nYelabuga, in Russia\u2019s southeastern Tatarstan region. This was confirmed by an\nunnamed Ukrainian intelligence source, Reuters reported, and a member of\nUkraine\u2019s military intelligence agency (GUR) told the Kyiv Independent the\nsame. According to initial reports, officials in Kyiv believe that the attack\ncaused significant damage to the facility, although this cannot be\nindependently verified.\n\nAnother video shows the blast from a different angle, followed by people\nrunning for cover.\n\nWith a propeller at the front, a braced high wing, conventional tail, and\nfixed undercarriage, the drone used in the Ukrainian attack appears to be a\ncivilian light aircraft adapted as a one-way attack drone.\n\nA close-up of the drone used in today\u2019s attack on Yelabuga, in the Tatarstan\nregion. via X\n\nOne possibility is that it is a development of the Ukrainian-made Aeroprakt\nA-22, which is classified as an ultralight and is produced as a factory-built\naircraft and as a kit.\n\nWith maximum fuel, the standard A-22 has a range of around 680 miles,\nsuggesting that, with some modifications, it would be able to cover the\ndistance involved, depending on the weight of the warhead and guidance\nequipment.\n\nAn Aeroprakt A-22 ultralight flown by a private operator in the United\nKingdom. Arpingstone/Wikimedia Commons\n\nBroadly similar drone designs have been used before by Ukraine for long-range\nattacks, most notably the UJ-22. This is also a single-engine propeller drone\nbut, despite its light aircraft layout, it was developed from scratch, rather\nthan being a modification of an existing platform, and is smaller than a\nmanned type. It has a reported range of around 500 miles, too short for the\nTatarstan strikes.\n\nIn Tatarstan, regional head Rustam Minnikhanov admitted that drones had\nattacked industrial sites in the region in the early hours \u2014 apparently around\n5:45 a.m. local time \u2014 and that several people had been wounded.\n\n\u201cThere is no serious damage, the technological process of the enterprises is\nnot disrupted,\u201d Minnikhanov said, although he didn\u2019t specifically mention the\ndrone factory.\n\nMeanwhile, there have also been questions raised as to whether the building\nstruck by the drone was part of the plant manufacturing the Shahed.\n\nRussian media reports suggest that the strike in Yelabuga actually hit a\ndormitory housing workers and that at least 12 students were injured. The\nShahed production plant is within a \u201cspecial economic zone,\u201d an area with a\ndifferent legal system aimed at attracting foreign investment and including\nvarious other industrial facilities.\n\nRegardless, other targets in the wider Tatarstan region also came under attack\nthis morning, including the Taneco oil refinery in Nizhnekamsk, state news\nagency RIA reported.\n\nIt appears that a different type of drone was used to attack the Taneco\nrefinery, based on an available video that purports to show the wreckage. Some\naccounts have suggested this is an example of the aforementioned UJ-22, but\nthat does not look to be the case based on the gear and general configuration\nof the wreckage.\n\nWhatever the degree of damage to the Shahed plant, the attack shows the\npotential for Ukraine to disrupt critical war industries deep within Russia.\nIt\u2019s notable, too, that the Shahed factory was apparently targeted at the same\ntime as Russia is making heavy use of these drones to attack Ukraine\u2019s energy\ninfrastructure.\n\nAs well as the military and symbolic value of an attempted attack on the\nShahed production plant, along with one of Russia\u2019s biggest refineries, this\ndrone raid is also notable as it is one of the deepest launched by Ukraine\ninto Russian territory. Yelabuga, for example, is roughly 700 miles from the\nclosest Ukrainian border area. Depending on where the drone took off from, it\nmay even be the longest-range attack of its kind ever launched by Ukraine \u2014\nprevious attacks in and around St. Petersburg also involve broadly similar\ndistances.\n\nDespite the distance involved, the drone factory was always going to be an\nabsolute top target for Ukraine.\n\nEver since October 2022, Ukraine has come under sustained attack from Iranian-\ndesigned Shahed series drones. The importance of this weapon to Moscow\u2019s war\nin Ukraine prompted moves to establish a local production effort.\n\nKyiv, October 17, 2022: Ukrainian rescuers work at the site of a residential\nbuilding destroyed by a Russian drone strike, which local authorities\nconsidered to have involved an Iranian-made Shahed-136.

As of last August, it was\nbeing reported that the Russian plant had \u201creassembled drones provided by Iran\nbut ... itself manufactured only drone bodies, and probably for not more than\n300 of the UAVs.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, sources in Ukraine stated that the factory will only make the\nfull transition to Russian components sometime next year. The \u2018Russianization\u2019\nof the Shahed has meanwhile also seen the introduction of various improvements\nto the drones, some of which you can read more about here and here.\n\nRegardless of any technical innovations incorporated in the drones, the sheer\nnumber of these weapons that Russia plans to build presents Ukraine with a\nvery serious problem, especially as it struggles to secure additional air\ndefense systems from its allies in the United States and Europe.\n\nIn August last year, The Washington Post reported that Russia plans to\n\u201cdomestically build 6,000 drones by summer 2025.\u201d\n\nThe same report concluded, \u201cthe sprawling new drone factory could help Russia\npreserve its dwindling supply of precision munitions, thwart Ukraine\u2019s effort\nto retake occupied territory, and dramatically advance Moscow\u2019s position in\nthe drone arms race that is remaking modern warfare.\u201d\n\nRussian-made Shahed-type drones take shape in the factory established in\nYelabuga, in Russia\u2019s southeastern Tatarstan region. via X Via X\n\nAlready, Moscow\u2019s use of Shahed drones has brought widespread destruction\nacross much of Ukraine. In the process, the drones have taken a steady toll on\nthe civilian population, as well as hitting critical power infrastructure for\ntwo winters in a row.\n\nStriking at the production facility for these notorious weapons was therefore\nvery a high priority for Ukraine. This is something we laid out in our\noriginal piece on the Shahed factory, stating:\n\n\"...The drone factory in Tatarstan, although located 500 miles east of Moscow,\nis bound to be firmly in the sights of Ukraine, with an attack on the facility\nthreatening the future supply of Russian-made Shaheds. Ukraine is steadily\nincreasing the range at which it can strike targets within Russian borders,\nincluding using sabotage teams as well as long-range drones and missiles.\n\nAfter all, once the Russian Shahed production effort is properly established\nand scaled-up, Ukraine will not only face the prospect of drone attacks on a\nlarger scale but potentially also the threat of significantly more capable\nversions of these menacing weapons.\"\n\nA forensic expert stands by wreckage of a Shahed drone in the Shevchenkivskyi\ndistrict of Kyiv after a Russian attack. Anatolii Siryk/Ukrinform/Future\nPublishing via Getty Images\n\nWhatever the type of drone involved, it points to Ukraine\u2019s growing ability to\nstrike targets very deep within Russia\u2019s borders.\n\nIn January this year, the Ukrainian military heralded the launch of a \u201cnew\nphase\u201d in the conflict, one that is relying heavily on the country\u2019s recently\ndeveloped long-range one-way attack drones.\n\nThat campaign began with a round of strikes against targets in St. Petersburg\nand the Leningrad region, exploiting new long-range drone technology, with\ndrones that offer greater reach as well as a higher level of performance and\nlarger payloads, compared with previous designs.\n\nMembers of the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations take security measures\naround an apartment block after an alleged drone attack reported in the\nKrasnogvardeysky district of St. Petersburg, Russia, on March 2, 2024. Photo\nby Stringer/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nFor long now, Ukraine\u2019s campaign of \u2014 fairly sporadic \u2014 long-range drone\nstrikes was seen as an act of defiance, a means of best \u2018bringing the war\nhome\u2019 to Russia, as well as to offer an alternative means of fighting back as\nthe situation along the front lines continues to stagnate.\n\nNow, however, Ukraine is waging a well-organized and concerted campaign\nagainst Russian oil infrastructure, in particular. On just one day last month,\nUkraine sent long-range drones against a dozen Russian oil refineries,\nreportedly amounting to about 12 percent of its total oil-processing capacity.\nThe effects of this campaign are already being seen, with Russian oil\ncompanies forced to reduce production, resulting in a spike in global oil\nprices.\n\nNot surprisingly, the raids on Tatarstan have again raised questions about the\nefficiency of Russian air defenses, a theme that has come up repeatedly since\nUkraine first launched long-range drone strikes on its territory. While the\nair defense forces are clearly stretched very thin due to the war in Ukraine\nand the requirement to cover the highest-priority objectives, not least the\ncapital, it should also be recalled that detecting and destroying low- and\nslow-flying targets can be difficult \u2014 something that was as true in Soviet\ntimes as it is today. But the Shahed factory is of such high military\nimportance, it is very strange that point defenses were not present \u2014 or at\nleast active \u2014 when the strike took place.\n\nNow that Ukraine is better able to launch long-range drone strikes, it also\nmeans it can hit back against far-flung critical military targets, too,\nincluding the Shahed production facility. Regardless of the success or\notherwise of this strike, if Russia thought that establishing a drone factory\n500 miles east of Moscow would provide some element of protection, today\u2019s\nevents will force them to reevaluate that notion.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com\n\nAround The GlobeDronesEuropeRussiaUkraineUnmanned\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletters\n\nSign Up\n\n  * About TWZ\n  * The Team\n  * Contact Us\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Terms & Conditions\n  * Sitemap\n\n\u00a9 2024 Recurrent Ventures.
