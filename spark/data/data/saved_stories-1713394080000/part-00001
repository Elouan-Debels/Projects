They transform both speaker\nand hearer; they feed energy back and forth and amplify it. They feed\nunderstanding or emotion back and forth and amplify it,\u201d Ursula K. Le Guin\nwrote in her exquisite manifesto for the magic of real human conversation.\nEach word is a portable cathedral in which we clarify and sanctify our\nexperience, a reliquary and a laboratory, holding the history of our search\nfor meaning and the pliancy of the possible future, of there being richer and\ndeeper dimensions of experience than those we name in our surface impressions.\nIn the roots of words we find a portal to the mycelial web of invisible\nconnections undergirding our emotional lives \u2014 the way \u201csadness\u201d shares a\nLatin root with \u201csated\u201d and originally meant a fulness of experience, the way\n\u201choly\u201d shares a Latin root with \u201cwhole\u201d and has its Indo-European origins in\nthe notion of the interleaving of all things.\n\nBecause we know their power, we ask of words to hold what we cannot hold \u2014 the\ncomplexity of experience, the polyphony of voices inside us narrating that\nexperience, the longing for clarity amid the confusion. There is, therefore,\nsingular disorientation to those moments when they fail us \u2014 when these\nprefabricated containers of language turn out too small to contain emotions at\nonce overwhelmingly expansive and acutely specific.\n\nArt by Marc Martin from We Are Starlings\n\nJohn Koenig offers a remedy for this lack in The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows\n(public library) \u2014 a soulful invitation to \u201cget to work redefining the world\naround us, until our language more closely matches the reality we experience.\u201d\n\nThe title, though beautiful, is misleading \u2014 the emotional states Koenig\ndefines are not obscure but, despite their specificity, profoundly relatable\nand universal; they are not sorrows but emissaries of the bittersweet, with\nall its capacity for affirming the joy of being alive: maru mori (\u201cthe\nheartbreaking simplicity of ordinary things\u201d), apolytus (\u201cthe moment you\nrealize you are changing as a person, finally outgrowing your old problems\nlike a reptile shedding its skin\u201d), the wends (\u201cthe frustration that you\u2019re\nnot enjoying an experience as much as you should... as if your heart had been\ninadvertently demagnetized by a surge of expectations\u201d), anoscetia (\u201cthe\nanxiety of not knowing \u2018the real you'\u201d), d\u00e8s vu (\u201cthe awareness that this\nmoment will become a memory\u201d).\n\nKoenig composites his imaginative etymologies from a multitude of sources:\nnames and places from folklore and pop culture, terms from chemistry and\nastronomy, the existing lexicon of languages living and dead, from Latin and\nAncient Greek to Japanese and M\u0101ori. He writes:\n\n> In language, all things are possible. Which means that no emotion is\n> untranslatable. No sorrow is too obscure to define. We just have to do it.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> Despite what dictionaries would have us believe, this world is still mostly\n> undefined.\n\nArt by Julie Paschkis from Pablo Neruda: Poet of the People\n\nThere are various words addressing the maddening uncertainty of the two\nfundamental dimensions of human life: time and love.\n\n> \u00c9NOUEMENT n. the bittersweetness of having arrived here in the future,\n> finally learning the answers to how things turned out but being unable to\n> tell your past self.\n>\n> French \u00e9nouer, to pluck defective bits from a stretch of cloth + d\u00e9nouement,\n> the final part of a story, in which all the threads of the plot are drawn\n> together and everything is explained. Pronounced \u201cey-noo-mahn.\u201d\n\n> QUERINOUS adj. longing for a sense of certainty in a relationship; wishing\n> there were some way to know ahead of time whether this is the person you\u2019re\n> going to wake up next to for twenty thousand mornings in a row, instead of\n> having to count them out one by one, quietly hoping your streak continues.\n>\n> Mandarin \u786e\u8ba4 (qu\u00e8r\u00e8n), confirmation. Twenty thousand days is roughly fifty-\n> five years. Pronounced \u201ckweh-ruh-nuhs.\u201d\n\nThere are words that reckon with the challenges of self-knowledge.\n\n> AGNOSTHESIA n. the state of not knowing how you really feel about something,\n> which forces you to sift through clues hidden in your own behavior, as if\n> you were some other person \u2014 noticing a twist of acid in your voice, an\n> obscene amount of effort you put into something trifling, or an inexplicable\n> weight on your shoulders that makes it difficult to get out of bed.\n>\n> Ancient Greek \u1f04\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (\u00e1gn\u014dstos), not knowing + \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (di\u00e1thesis),\n> condition, mood. Pronounced \u201cag-nos-thee-zhuh.\u201d\n\n> ZIELSCHMERZ n. the dread of finally pursuing a lifelong dream, which\n> requires you to put your true abilities out there to be tested on the open\n> savannah, no longer protected inside the terrarium of hopes and delusions\n> that you started up in kindergarten and kept sealed as long as you could.\n>\n> German Ziel, goal + Schmerz, pain. Pronounced \u201czeel-shmerts.\u201d\n\nArt by Paloma Valdivia for Pablo Neruda\u2019s Book of Questions\n\nThere are words that anchor us in both the smallness and the grandeur of\nexistence, its fierce fragility, its devastating beauty; words tasked with\nholding the hardest truth \u2014 that we are children of chance, born of a billion\nbright improbabilities that prevailed over the infinitely greater odds of\nnonexistence, living with only marginal and mostly illusory control over the\ncircumstances of our lives and other people\u2019s choices, forever vulnerable to\nthe accidents of a universe insentient to our hopes.\n\n> GALAGOG n. the state of being simultaneously entranced and unsettled by the\n> vastness of the cosmos, which makes your deepest concerns feel laughably\n> quaint, yet vanishingly rare.\n>\n> From galaxy, a gravitationally bound system of millions of stars + agog,\n> awestruck. Pronounced \u201cgal-uh-gawg.\u201d\n\n> CRAXIS n. the unease of knowing how quickly your circumstances could change\n> on you\u2014that no matter how carefully you shape your life into what you want\n> it to be, the whole thing could be overturned in an instant, with little\n> more than a single word, a single step, a phone call out of the blue, and by\n> the end of next week you might already be looking back on this morning as if\n> it were a million years ago, a poignant last hurrah of normal life.\n>\n> Latin cr\u0101stin\u014d di\u0113, tomorrow + praxis, the process of turning theory into\n> reality. Pronounced \u201ckrak-sis.\u201d\n\n> SUERZA n. a feeling of quiet amazement that you exist at all; a sense of\n> gratitude that you were even born in the first place, that you somehow\n> emerged alive and breathing despite all odds, having won an unbroken streak\n> of reproductive lotteries that stretches all the way back to the beginning\n> of life itself.\n>\n> Spanish suerte, luck + fuerza, force. Pronounced \u201csoo-wair-zuh.\u201d\n\n> MAHPIOHANZIA n. the frustration of being unable to fly, unable to stretch\n> out your arms and vault into the air, having finally shrugged off the burden\n> of your own weight, which you\u2019ve been carrying your entire life without a\n> second thought.\n>\n> Lakota mahpiohanzi, \u201ca shadow caused by a cloud.\u201d Pronounced \u201cmah-pee-oh-\n> han-zee-uh.\u201d\n\nArt by Monika Vaicenavi\u010dien\u0117 from What Is a River?\n\nEmerging from the various entries is a reminder, both haunting and comforting,\nthat despite how singular our experience feels, we are all grappling with just\nabout the same core concerns; that our time is short and precious; that all of\nour confusions are a single question, the best answer to which is love.\n\nCouple The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows with Consolations \u2014 poet and\nphilosopher David Whyte\u2019s lovely meditations on the deeper meanings of\neveryday words \u2014 then revisit artist Ella Frances Sanders\u2019s illustrated\ndictionary of untranslatable words from around the world and poet Mary\nRuefle\u2019s chromatic taxonomy of sadnesses.\n\n# donating = loving\n\nEvery month, I spend hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars keeping The\nMarginalian going.
