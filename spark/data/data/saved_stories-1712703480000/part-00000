However,\nminorities, particularly Black and Hispanic people, start in a less trusted\nposition due to bias. This occurs even from a young age. In a study from the\nYale Child Study Center in 2016, teachers were asked to detect challenging\nbehavior in videos of preschool children in the classroom. While no such\nbehavior existed in any of the videos, when asked which children required the\nmost attention, 42 percent of the teachers, Black and white, identified the\nBlack boys. The same teachers also recommended harsher punishments for\nmisbehavior and were less empathetic to any additional shared context.[i]\nThese biases, which start in childhood, persist throughout adulthood and up\nthe ranks of a corporation.\n\nMinority aspiring executives often need to try ways that are further from\ntheir comfort zone and riskier to compensate for the effects of bias and build\ntrust with the \u201cin-group\u201d. They sometimes struggle to find the \u201ceasier ways\u201d\nof building trust through shared interests. They sometimes fail to find the\nbalance between being different and bringing a new perspective that is\nvaluable, but not so different that they risk being ostracized. These are\nlarge hurdles that frustrate some of the smartest people.\n\nThanks for reading The Uncommon Executive!

There\u2019s a difference between professional\nrelationships and personal friendships. In recent years, the lines have become\nmore blurred, particularly at Silicon Valley startups where employees are\nencouraged to socialize at work among the Ping-Pong tables; flowing craft\ncoffee, wine, and beer; and company-sponsored team bonding events. However, it\nis possible and important to make a clear distinction between the professional\nand the personal.\n\nTo find professional commonalities, focus on what you can help them with at\nwork. First, I ask questions about what they do, what problems they\u2019re facing,\nand what goals they have. I listen and look for common perspectives on\nculture, process, or strategy. I look for shared past experiences at work or\nshared ambitions for the future. Perhaps you are both struggling with a\nparticular process. Perhaps you are both aspiring executives who want to get\nahead. Perhaps you both agree that there\u2019s a better approach for the product.\nFind the commonalities that will allow you to make conversation, share ideas,\nand build camaraderie. In many cases, one shared perspective is enough for a\nrecurring coffee walk to catch up. It also can result in shared projects or\ntasks you kick off and lead together. There are many other ways to build\nrelationships at work that don\u2019t involve socialization activities:\n\n  1. Volunteer to help take notes for your peers in meetings and send it over within the day with a quick summary of possible next steps.\n\n  2. Point out their achievements and be their advocate. If you\u2019re in a meeting with someone, you could say things like \u201cTina had a great idea about this\u201d or \u201cDan noticed this issue recently,\u201d where relevant. Or help advocate for that person in your professional circles (it always makes it back to the person).\n\n  3. Make time to talk and see if there\u2019s something the other person is working on that you could support. This could be learning a hard skill (e.g., studying AI together could be useful). It could be a soft skill; maybe the other person is getting feedback that they\u2019re too aggressive, too quiet, need to collaborate more, or need to work on public speaking. Volunteer to be their partner and help them see their blind spots or hold up a mirror when they need it.\n\n  4. Connect this person with another coworker. Find something they need help with, suggest someone who can help, and connect them.\n\n  5. Support their personal or career goals. Find out what type of knowledge or skill this person wants to learn, and proactively share relevant materials you come across. Volunteer to be an accountability buddy if you share the same goals.\n\nI think it\u2019s a misconception that being more social increases your leadership\npotential. We all know that person who got ahead by golfing with the CEO.\nHowever, I find that to be the exception. At the end of the day, it\u2019s more\nimportant that you have the skill set to do the job well and that you can\ninfluence your peers and motivate your teams.\n\nIn addition to sharing professional interests, it is helpful to layer on\nshared social interests. Many minorities find that they don\u2019t immediately have\nshared social interests with their white male colleagues. One way is to\nsuggest alternative activities that you enjoy. If you don\u2019t want to go to a\nbaseball game, suggest bowling. If you don\u2019t want to do a beer crawl, suggest\na wine tasting. I\u2019ve found that people often default to things they\u2019ve done\nbefore, but they are more than willing to try out a new venue or activity if\nsomeone else takes the lead. People usually aren\u2019t intentionally trying to\nexclude; they simply default to \u201cthe usual\u201d until an alternative is suggested.\nAnother option is to take an interest in something that many people at your\nworkplace enjoy. After all, any new hobby starts with a first try. I give any\nnew activity three tries before making a call. People appreciate you going out\nof your comfort zone to try something they enjoy, and sometimes you can build\na bond through why it\u2019s just not right for you (ask me why I highly dislike\nescape rooms for leadership events). That said, don\u2019t get disheartened if\nyou\u2019re unsuccessful in the attempt to connect on a social level. Many leaders\nand executives are introverts who are thoughtful and reliable; they\u2019re not the\nperson who wants to be everyone\u2019s friend.\n\n[i] Cory Turner, \u201cBias Isn\u2019t Just a Police Problem, It\u2019s a Preschool Problem,\u201d\nNPR, September 28, 2016,\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/09/28/495488716/bias-isnt-just-a-police-\nproblem-its-a-preschool-problem.Many minorities want to build a closer\nrelationship with a few important leaders in their company. The age-old \u201cboys\nclub\u201d phenomenon, resulting from in-group bias and affinity bias, is one of\nthe most mentioned barriers to executive leadership. When I talk about\nbuilding trust and relationships with the minorities whom I coach, they often\nsay things like I have nothing in common with them. I don\u2019t go to baseball\ngames. I can\u2019t make happy hours as a mom. I don\u2019t play golf!\n\nThanks for reading The Uncommon Executive!
