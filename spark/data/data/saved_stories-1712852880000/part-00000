It's a simple site at\nChaosPixels.com that changes every day. We pick the top-voted PR from users,\nmerge it, and update the site.\n\n## How It Works\n\nUsers submit pull requests (PRs) to modify the website's source code in the\nsrc directory. Others show their support by leaving a \ud83d\udc4d reaction on the\ninitial comment of the PR. At the end of each day, I sum up the votes, and the\nPR with the highest score is merged and deployed. After that, I close all open\nPRs and we start the next day.\n\nEach \ud83d\udc4d is initially worth one point. You can increase the impact of your vote\nby buying a boost, each $1 you spend adds +1 to your voting power, and this\nenhancement does not expire.\n\n## What's the Point?\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why I started this:\n\n  1. I'm fascinated by how simple rules can create complex and unpredictable results. It's exciting to see where this experiment goes.\n  2. Exploring ways to make money online, and this project might just be the golden ticket with some Saudi Arabia prince buying $1 million boost to make sure his PR is merged. Who knows? :)\n\n## Is Anything Allowed in PRs?\n\nYes, with a few important exceptions. We welcome creative and innovative\ncontributions, but please steer clear of anything illegal, pornographic, or\nrelated to gambling. It's all about maintaining a positive vibe and building\nsomething cool together.\n\nNow, let's spread some chaos PRs! :)\n\nps. I created a subreddit for project related discussions.\n\n## About\n\nNo description, website, or topics provided.\n\n### Resources\n\nReadme\n\nActivity\n\n### Stars\n\n0 stars\n\n### Watchers\n\n1 watching\n\n### Forks\n\n2 forks\n\nReport repository\n\n## Releases\n\nNo releases published\n\n## Packages 0\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n  * HTML 93.9%\n  * JavaScript 6.1%\n\n## Footer\n\n\u00a9 2024 GitHub, Inc.\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
