Anyone who receives a letter with a fake stamp\nis charged \u00a35 by Royal Mail.\n\nConservative MP Iain Duncan Smith told BBC Breakfast: \"China is behind it.\"\n\nA Royal Mail spokesman said: \"We are working hard to remove counterfeit stamps\nfrom circulation.\"\n\nConsumers are being warned to look out for strange perforations around the\nedge of a stamp, a shine to the surface or the colour looking off.\n\nAn investigation by the Daily Telegraph found that four Chinese companies had\noffered to print up to one million counterfeit stamps a week, with each stamp\nbeing sold for as little as 4p each before being sent to the UK.\n\nThe fakes have been found for sale on various websites, the paper said, and\nthey were also bought by small retailers who did not realise they were\ncounterfeit.\n\n  * Stamps join the digital world with barcodes\n\nAlan Mendoza, from security think tank the Henry Jackson Society, told BBC\nBreakfast: \"We don't know the extent on whether the Chinese government are\ninvolved - but what we do know is that Chinese firms are involved.\"\n\nBusiness Minister Kevin Hollinrake said: \"It is key to prevent counterfeit\nstamps entering our supply chain in the UK. \"The Royal Mail must do everything\npossible to prevent counterfeits entering our circulation and must establish\nwhere they are coming from and how they are entering our marketplace.\"\n\nHowever, the chance of getting a counterfeit stamp is low, Royal Mail's\ndirector of external affairs and policy, David Gold, told the BBC's Watchdog\nprogramme on Wednesday.\n\n\"People should understand that the overwhelming majority of stamps on sale are\nlegitimate,\" he said.\n\n\"The number of [counterfeit] stamps that we are spotting account for less than\n0.1% of the total stamps going through the network.\"\n\nBarcoded stamps were introduced in 2022 to cut down on the sale of fakes and\nMr Gold said this had reduced the number of counterfeits by 90%.\n\nHowever, he admitted that even he struggled to spot a fake. \"The reality is\ncounterfeiters now are so good at what they do that even I... can't tell the\ndifference just by looking at them.\"\n\nA Royal Mail spokesman said: \"We regularly monitor online marketplaces to\ndetect suspicious activity, such as sales of heavily discounted stamps and\nwork closely with retailers and law enforcement agencies to identify those who\nproduce counterfeit stamps.\"\n\n## Tips to avoid buying fake stamps\n\nRoyal Mail suggests several ways to reduce the chances of ending up with fake\nstamps:\n\n  * Beware of discounts: Online sellers promoting what appears to be a \"too good to be true\" offer might be selling counterfeits\n  * Use well known shops: Buy stamps from a Royal Mail-approved outlet such as the Post Office, reputable High Street retailers or the Royal Mail website\n  * Spot the signs: Counterfeits which can have an unusually shiny surface, unusual colouration or inaccurate perforations, but this is not always the case\n  * Report it: If you suspect you have been a victim of stamp fraud complete the Royal Mail's online form or call the company's customer services team on 03457 740 740.\n\nHave you come across fake stamps?
