We sometimes call it\nunthinkable. But we need to think carefully, and to talk\u2014particularly with\nhigh-ranking foreign officials whose motives we may have reason to distrust,\njust as they distrust ours\u2014about how we can collectively avoid launching a\nweapon that would end our civilization.\n\nPulitzer Prize finalist Annie Jacobsen\u2019s timely new book, Nuclear War: A\nScenario, is a lightning-fast read intended to put the nuclear threat squarely\nback on everyone\u2019s radar. Her narrative thread, as the title suggests, is a\nfact-based (though thankfully fictional) scenario that shows how a nuclear\nlaunch can escalate into World War III at dizzying speed.\n\nJacobsen tees up her cinematic approach with chapters describing how we got\nhere, including a discussion of America\u2019s Single Integrated Operational Plan\n(SIOP) for General Nuclear War\u2014which was devised in the 1960s and, as Jacobsen\ndetails in this book excerpt published today by Mother Jones, was more or less\na recipe for the end of the world.\n\nBecause that\u2019s nuclear war: One bad assumption, one shot, one retaliation, and\nit\u2019s unstoppable.\n\nYour book is frightful. What made you want to write in such detail how a\nnuclear war could unfold?\n\nAs a national security reporter, I have written six previous books on military\nand intelligence programs\u2014CIA, Pentagon, DARPA\u2014all designed to prevent nuclear\nWorld War III. During the Trump administration, amid the \u201cfire and fury\u201d\nrhetoric, I was watching STRATCOM commanders and deputy commanders speak\nfreely on C-SPAN about the dangers therein. I began to wonder, My god, what\nwould happen if deterrence failed? I began to interview people during COVID,\nwhen people had more time on their hands for someone like me\u2014and that began\nthe terrifying process of learning that nuclear war is, in essence, a sequence\nof events, and that once it starts it almost certainly will not stop.\n\nThe US public hasn\u2019t thought a whole lot about nuclear weapons since the Cold\nWar. We have more nuclear nations today, but far fewer weapons in the global\narsenal. Are we safer now?\n\nWell, as I show in the book, it doesn\u2019t take but one weapon to set off a chain\nreaction to unleash the current arsenal, which is forward deployed in launch-\non-warning positions and could be fired in as little as a minute\u201415 minutes\nfor the submarines. There are enough weapons in those positions right now to\nbring on a nuclear winter that would kill an estimated 5 billion people.\n\nAre there too many? Absolutely. Have we made progress? The all-time high in\n1986 was 70,481 nuclear weapons. Now, there are approximately 12,500. But to\nyour point, there are nine nuclear-armed nations, not just two or three\nsuperpowers. And that presents a lot of unknowns that create serious unease\nand room for catastrophe.\n\nSo we may be less safe because we don\u2019t really know how certain nations might\nbehave\u2014notably North Korea.\n\nAbsolutely. Reporting and writing this book was one surprise after another.\nFor example, I did not know until I had it confirmed with US nuclear experts\nthat North Korea does not announce any of its missile tests, whereas the other\ncountries do. North Korea has launched 100 missiles since January 2022. After\nyou read my book, you realize what happens to the US nuclear command and\ncontrol apparatus in the seconds and minutes after a launch is seen by the\nadvanced super satellite system we have. You can now imagine what goes on in\nthose command centers.\n\nA total frenzy.\n\nImagine!\n\nOne thing that really struck me is the unbelievable speed at which nuclear war\nis waged.\n\nGen. Robert Kehler, the former commander of STRATCOM, said to me that the\nworld could end in the next couple of hours. It took me a minute to ask my\nnext question, because coming from someone in that position of authority\u2014the\nmost significant role in the entire nuclear apparatus\u2014that really blew my\nmind.\n\nDitto goes for an interview I did with President Barack Obama\u2019s FEMA chief,\nCraig Fugate. Of course, FEMA is the agency in charge of what\u2019s called\npopulation protection planning for American citizens in the event of\nhurricanes, floods, earthquakes. Fugate told me that after a nuclear war,\nthere wouldn\u2019t be any population protection planning because everyone would be\ndead.\n\nHelp is not coming.\n\nI said, \u201cWell, what should people do?\u201d He more or less said, \u201cSelf-survive,\nand don\u2019t forget your morals, and I hope you stocked Pedialyte\u201d\u2014because\nradiation poisoning makes you vomit and have diarrhea and away go all of your\nelectrolytes, which leads to secondary problems.\n\nI learned from your book that FEMA plays a unique role in the event of a\nnuclear attack, and it\u2019s not what one might expect.\n\nThat\u2019s right. In the \u201950s and \u201960s, the US position was that a nuclear war\ncould be fought and won. That is no longer the official position. But plans\nwere put in place for the continuity of government programs\u2014the idea that the\ngovernment must continue functioning no matter what. That is also a fantasy.\n\nTo hear from former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry about the madness and\nmayhem and anarchy that would follow, in his mind, in the event of a nuclear\nwar, you really get the sense that civilization will fail. I believe one of\nthe reasons so many of these sources went on the record for me is because they\nknow that this is the truth. And they know it is up to the people to change\nthe trajectory of where we\u2019re headed. I mean, my god, look at the saber-\nrattling going on as we do this interview.\n\nPotential nuclear nightmares range from an accidental detonation to a massive\n\u201cdecapitation\u201d strike to someone using a small nuke on the battlefield. You\npicked the madman scenario: North Korea inexplicably launches a long-range\nmissile at Washington, DC. Why that one?\n\nI did a series of interviews with [physicist] Richard Garwin, who is now 95.\nHe is arguably the most knowledgeable person about nuclear weapons on the\nplanet, and he probably knows more about policy over the long lens of history\nbecause he was 23 or 24 years old when he designed the first thermonuclear\nbomb.\n\nIn the \u201cIvy Mike\u201d test, it exploded with 10.4 megatons of power\u2014about 1,000\nHiroshimas. Garwin said to me that his biggest fear was now, and always had\nbeen, the madman theory you referred to. He used the French phrase Apr\u00e8s moi,\nle d\u00e9luge\u2014after me, the flood\u2014referring to this idea that a maniacal,\negotistical, narcissistic madman leader could launch a nuclear weapon for\nreasons no one would ever know.\n\nAnd to counterattack North Korea, as in your scenario, the US would need to\nsend missiles over Russia, which has a very unreliable early warning system.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Learning about the technological limitations of some of the\nRussian systems was just as terrifying as any part of reporting this book.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019d want to reach out to the Russians and say, look, just\ntake our technology so you won\u2019t launch on a false alarm\u2014but the US would\nnever do that.\n\nThere have been many opportunities to have a dialogue with the Russians\u2014Putin\ninquired about joining NATO back during the Clinton administration. One really\nhas to lean upon one\u2019s leaders to think about communicating rather than saber-\nrattling, because I hope that my book demonstrates in appalling detail how\nhorrific nuclear war would be. And we know from the Proud Prophet war games\nthat no matter how it begins, it ends in nuclear apocalypse.\n\nFor context, Proud Prophet was a classified series of war games President\nRonald Reagan ordered in 1983. Civilian and military planners convened for two\nweeks to run through scenarios that could spark a nuclear war and see how they\nplayed out.\n\nThat Proud Prophet was declassified is interesting. Nuclear war games are\namong the government\u2019s most jealously guarded secrets. I printed a copy of\nwhat a couple pages of the declassified war game look like\u201495 percent is\nredacted. It\u2019s literally a couple of headers and a few numbers.\n\nBut when something like that gets declassified, it becomes very valuable to\nthe people. An individual like Paul Bracken\u2014a civilian professor at Yale who\nparticipated in Proud Prophet\u2014can now speak about it in general terms. He\nwrote in his own book that everyone left very depressed, because no matter how\nthe nuclear scenario begins\u2014if NATO is involved or not involved, China is\ninvolved or not\u2014it always ends the same way, the most terrible way, because\nAmerica has a \u201claunch on warning\u201d policy.\n\nWe do not wait to absorb a nuclear blow. Once a missile is on the way and\nthere is secondary confirmation from ground radar, the president is asked to\nlaunch a counterstrike. In the book\u2014I have the president asking this because\nit came up in my discussions with sources\u2014he says, \u201cHow do we know it\u2019s a\nnuclear weapon?\u201d\n\nAnd we don\u2019t.\n\nThat is a fact. The answer is, Well, it could be a biological weapon. Another\nanswer I was told is that no one launches a ballistic missile at the United\nStates unless they\u2019re expecting a counterattack. So now you are looping into\nthe Orwellian world of: This is deterrence. Deterrence will hold. Don\u2019t you\ndare launch at us or else! Which becomes part and parcel for why the\ncounterattack is required, per the deterrence doctrine. There is no room for\nsaying, well, maybe we\u2019ll wait and see.\n\nOnce you break deterrence, everything else goes out the window.\n\nCorrect. One of the most haunting quotes in the book is from the deputy\ncommander of STRATCOM, Lt. Gen. Tom Bussiere. I located an unclassified\ndiscussion he had with insiders, and the quote is along the lines of, When\ndeterrence fails, it all unravels. In seconds and minutes and hours\u2014not days\nand weeks and months.\n\nTwelve thousand years of civilization extinguished in a few hours.\n\nGeneral Kehler was not speaking hyperbolically when he said that.\n\nSay more about \u201claunch on warning.\u201d You cite Paul Nitze, a former defense\nsecretary and later presidential adviser, calling the policy \u201cinexcusably\ndangerous.\u201d Presidents Bush, Obama, and Biden wanted it scrapped. So why is it\nstill in place?\n\nI\u2019d like to shout out William Burr, who runs the National Security Archive at\nGeorge Washington University, because many of those quotes and documents come\nfrom that organization, which made them accessible to journalists like me.\nNitze was one of the biggest hawks across the Cold War. To have a guy like\nthat go on the record and say this is inexcusably dangerous says a lot.\n\nMultiple presidents have campaigned on the promise that they will change this\ndangerous policy, but then they become president and you never hear of it\nagain. That speaks to the kind of secret-keeping that is dangerous and can be\nchanged. I wrote Nuclear War: A Scenario for the layperson to be able to rip\nthrough it in a night, no matter how terrifying. I do not bog the reader down\nwith polemics or jargon, because this is an issue everybody should know about.\nBecause only in knowing about it is change possible. We can look to The Day\nAfter battle, what\u2019s known in inner circles as the Reagan Reversal policy of\n1983.\n\nWait, what\u2019s that?\n\nSo in 1983\u2014I\u2019m dating myself here\u2014I was a high school student. And I watched\nthe ABC movie The Day After.\n\nI was the same age, and watching it too.\n\nIt\u2019s a fictional account of a nuclear war between America and Soviet Russia,\nand half the country watched it. Interestingly, behind the scenes, ABC got a\nlot of pressure not to air it. Well, one very important American watched it:\nReagan had a private screening at Camp David. His chief of staff tried to\nsuggest that he shouldn\u2019t watch it, but he did. And he wrote in his diary that\nhe became \u201cgreatly depressed,\u201d and he picked up the phone and called\n[then\u2013Soviet President Mikhail] Gorbachev, and the two leaders\ncommunicated\u2014which is really the only solution for any of this.\n\nBecause of those communications and because of their conference and because of\nthe treaty, the insane nuclear arsenal has been reduced to the approximately\n12,500 we have now, which is a considerable reduction. The president\u2019s\nposition prior to seeing The Day After was a much harder, more saber-rattling\napproach. He changed his position and became much more dovish.\n\n\u201cLaunch on warning\u201d puts extraordinary pressure on a president. The one in\nyour scenario is pretty clueless. He hasn\u2019t ever rehearsed. Nobody told him\nhe\u2019d have just six minutes to choose from a Denny\u2019s breakfast menu of\nexistential options in response to what may or may not be an incoming nuke.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe the Pentagon doesn\u2019t put every new president through a\nseries of war games.\n\nI was just as surprised as you are. But that\u2019s coming from multiple\nsecretaries of defense and national security advisers\u2014people in a position to\nadvise the president on a nuclear counterattack. The best summation came from\nLeon Panetta, who explained that as White House chief of staff he was witness\nto the fact that the president is primarily concerned with domestic\nissues\u2014like his popularity. I asked Panetta how clued in he was when he was\nthe CIA director, and he said almost not at all, because the CIA is about\nintelligence, not nuclear operations.\n\nOnly when he became secretary of defense did it really hit home, the weight of\nall of this. He spoke about visiting missile silos, submarine bases, and\nnuclear command bunkers\u2014once you go to places like that, your entire\nperspective changes. And that is why I believe he was willing to go on the\nrecord. You really get the sense that things are precarious once they begin,\nand decisions follow that are out of everyone\u2019s control.\n\nRight. And our continued existence depends not only on our internal\ncommunications and processes, but those of our adversaries, about which we\nknow little.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nYour book busts some common myths, for instance the belief that the US could\nshoot down an incoming nuclear missile. We really can\u2019t defend against nuclear\nweapons, can we?\n\nWe can\u2019t. That is pure fantasy. During the final fact-checking incantations, I\nhad the book read by a lieutenant general who ran these scenarios for NORAD. I\nwas almost hoping someone would say, Annie, you should take this part out of\nthe book, because we have a secret Iron Dome that you can\u2019t report on. No. The\ntruth is that the United States relies upon 44 interceptor missiles to stop\nany incoming missiles. Russia alone has 1,674 nuclear warheads in \u201cready to\nlaunch\u201d position. Adding to that, according to congressional reports, the\ninterceptors are only approximately 50 percent effective.\n\nUnder the best of circumstances.\n\nAbsolutely, like when you\u2019re doing a test and you know precisely where the\nmissile is going to be. It\u2019s a curated test. So people have this idea that we\nhave an Iron Dome\u2013type shield. And we don\u2019t.\n\nThe Reagan Reversal bit reminds me of a moment from your scenario. Your\nsecretary of defense is sworn in as president because the president and others\nin the line of succession are dead or AWOL, and he has this moment of\nhumanity. Russia has launched all its ICBMs at us, so we know we\u2019re goners.\nAnd the new guy asks: Why respond now if all it will do is kill millions more\npeople? The STRATCOM commander is like, Nope, we\u2019re doing this. Humanity is\nalready doomed, yet Russia and the United States keep launching their weapons\nuntil practically none are left. It\u2019s nonsensical. But is it realistic?\n\nIt is if you talk to the sources I spoke to. A lot of the decision-tree\nsituations involving the defense secretary came from my multiple discussions\nwith former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry, who has thought a lot about\nthis\u2014and what an individual\u2019s thought process would be. The point of including\nthat question was to demonstrate how the madness of MAD\u2014mutual assured\ndestruction\u2014takes over.\n\nI asked [retired weapons engineer] Glen McDuff\u2014the curator of the classified\nmuseum at the Los Alamos National Laboratory\u2014the question you\u2019re kind of\nasking me: What did he think, as an insider, about the notion that people\nwould not follow orders? He basically said: Annie, I would suggest betting on\nPowerball, because you\u2019d have a better chance of winning than betting on a\nhigh-ranking individual in the nuclear command and control system not\nfollowing orders.\n\nRight. It seems like folks in the nuclear command and control structure have\nrehearsed these scenarios over and over. They\u2019re on autopilot to a degree.\nWhich gets at the notion of \u201capes on a treadmill\u201d that you write about late in\nthe book: We\u2019ve made this plan, and we\u2019re going to follow it\u2014even if it\u2019s\ncompletely bonkers.\n\nApes on the treadmill was just such a brilliant concept. It goes back to the\nCold War when it was used as a metaphor for people slavishly following away in\nthis nuclear arms race.\n\nBut even more interesting was the present-day anecdote I found. It was a\nscientific experiment having nothing to do with the original metaphor but was\nliterally apes on a treadmill. The researchers were studying bipedalism: They\nput humans on the treadmill and they put apes on the treadmill. Anecdotally,\none of the scientists said, and I\u2019m paraphrasing, that some of the apes got\nfed up with walking to nowhere and got off the treadmill.\n\nI thought, my god, the apes are smarter than the humans when it comes to\nmutual assured destruction.\n\n### Together, we make the world safer.\n\nThe Bulletin elevates expert voices above the noise.
