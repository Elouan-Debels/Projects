All three of our new\nVisiting Group Partners have lots to share on that front, as do our two\nreturning Visiting Group Partners \u2014 Tyler Bosmeny and Nate Smith.\n\nAndrew Miklas\n\nAndrew is the co-founder and former CTO of PagerDuty (S10), a digital\noperations platform used by thousands of businesses to coordinate their\nresponses to mission-critical issues. PagerDuty was the second YC company to\ngo public after their IPO on the NYSE in 2019.\n\nAs PagerDuty's founding CTO, he scaled the product & engineering team to 70+\nindividuals and led the team that designed the initial product and its high\navailability architecture. He has also been an investor in startups including\nRetool and CaptivateIQ. He has a BSE (Software Engineering) from the\nUniversity of Waterloo and an MSc in Computer Science from the University of\nToronto.\n\nOoshma Garg\n\nOoshma is the founder and former CEO of Gobble (W14), the easiest and fastest\nway to make home-cooked meals. Ooshma scaled the business from inception to\n$300M+ in subscription sales and ultimately to a profitable acquisition by\nIntelligent Brands in 2022.\n\nOoshma was named CEO of Intelligent Foods and managed 750+ employees working\nacross multiple nationwide D2C food brands, including Gobble and Sunbasket.\nOoshma has founded and built three businesses. She sold her first B2B SaaS\nstartup in 2010, just one year after graduating with a B.S. in BioMechanical\nEngineering from Stanford University.\n\nJon Xu\n\nJon is the co-founder and former CTO of FutureAdvisor (S10), one of the first\nrobo investment advisors that made high-quality investment management\navailable to everyone. FutureAdvisor was acquired by BlackRock in 2015 where\nJon continued to lead Product and Engineering as Managing Director in Aladdin\nWealth Tech. FutureAdvisor powered robo investment services for the largest\nbanks and broker dealers in the US and managed over $2B in client assets.\n\nPrior to starting FutureAdvisor, Jon graduated from MIT with a degree in\nComputer Science and worked on mobile data synchronization protocols at\nMicrosoft.\n\nWe\u2019re all looking forward to Andrew, Ooshma, and Jon getting started. As YC\nalumni themselves, they know how special our community is and how important it\nis to pay it forward by guiding the next generation of YC founders.\n\nCategories\n\nYC NewsPartners\n\nOther Posts\n\nYC Firesides and a new book by Surbhi Sarna\n\nJanuary 26, 2023 by Kat Ma\u00f1alac\n\nRead More\n\nYC's Spring Tour 2022\n\nJanuary 28, 2022 by Tamanna Khemani\n\nRead More\n\nYC Happy Hour at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference\n\nNovember 29, 2022 by Surbhi Sarna\n\nRead More\n\nSubscribe\n\n# Author\n\n  * ### Harj Taggar\n\nHarj is a Group Partner at YC.
