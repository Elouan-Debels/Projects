Expectations for what good software looks and feels\nlike have never been higher. Design Engineers are a core part in exceeding\nthat expectation.\n\nThis post will go behind the scenes for Design Engineering at Vercel, our\nwork, skills, and how we contribute to shipping with a high degree of polish\nand performance.\n\n## What is a Design Engineer?\n\nDesign Engineers at Vercel blend aesthetic sensibility with technical skills.\nThis allows us to deeply understand a problem, then design, build, and ship a\nsolution autonomously.\n\nThe team is made up of people with a wide array of skills and a lot of\ncuriosity. We constantly experiment with new tools and mediums. This\nmultidisciplinary approach allows the team to push what\u2019s possible on the web.\n\n## What do Design Engineers care about?\n\nDesign Engineers care about delivering exceptional user experiences that\nresonate with the viewer. For the web, this means:\n\n  * Delightful user interactions and affordances\n  * Building reusable components/primitives\n  * Page speed\n  * Cross-browser support\n  * Support for inclusive input modes (touch, pointers, etc.)\n  * Respecting user preferences\n  * Accessible to users of assistive technology\n\nThere is a lot of work behind the pretty pixels. Design Engineers must go\nbeyond visual appeal and ensure the other pieces that make an exceptional user\nexperience are taken care of.\n\n## What do Design Engineers do?\n\nAt Vercel, Design Engineers work across the company, contributing to branding,\nmarketing, product development, and the internal design system. This\ncollaboration falls under these workflows:\n\n### Design collaboration\n\nDesign Engineers work closely with designers to implement designs, skipping\nthe traditional handoff process. Instead of handing off a completed design, a\nDesigner sketches the start and iterates with a Design Engineer in Figma or\ncode to produce the final design. Lots of technical exploration is done to\npush the designs.\n\nThis close collaboration between Designer and Design Engineer starts from idea\nto production. Design Engineers consult Designers on aspects like:\n\n  * Considering implementation cost versus the impact on experience\u2014for example, some animations are unnecessary because they are not the main focus.\n  * Deciding if a component is one-off or built for reusability.\n  * Providing guidance based on web practices or experience.\n  * Prototyping design explorations that are easier to do outside of Figma\u2014for example, animations, keyboard controls, and touch are better implemented in code to save the time and effort of reimplementing them from a different medium to the web.\n\nCollaboration happens through Slack messages, screenshots, videos, preview\nlinks, and Zoom calls.\n\n### Product team integration\n\nDesign Engineers are embedded in a product team to help launch features that\nusually take more than a month. A Designer may or may not assist. When a\nDesigner does help, the Design Engineer implements the UI while the product\nteam implements the API and infrastructure.\n\nWhen a Designer isn\u2019t helping, it doesn\u2019t mean the Design Engineer works alone\non the design and implementation. The Design Engineer creates the initial\nsketch and gets feedback from both Designers and Engineers.\n\n### Independent ownership\n\nThis happens for features that are related to a user pain point and takes a\nfew days to weeks to launch. The Design Engineer will sketch in Figma or code\na solution, socialize the change, incorporate feedback, then ship it.\n\nThe team also works on design-led projects. Being part of the Design team\ngives Design Engineers the autonomy and ability to work on things that would\noften get deprioritized in an Engineering backlog.\n\nThe team puts resources towards polished interactions, no dropped frames, no\ncross-browser inconsistencies, and accessibility. Examples of design-led\nprojects are:\n\n  1. Vercel\u2019s Geist font: A Sans and Mono font. An interactive playground to see every glyph and try the font.\n  2. Vercel\u2019s design system documentation: An interactive docs playground used by engineers across the company to ship Vercel.\n  3. Vercel\u2019s Design Team homepage: An exploratory page for testing new web techniques and providing design resources.\n  4. Delighters in the Vercel Dashboard: Features in the Vercel Dashboard that bring it to life and delight the user.\n\nNo matter the workflow, we are given space to prioritize quality over\nquantity. We recognize that what we ship is never in a perfect state. Iterate\nto Greatness is one of Vercel\u2019s principles, allowing us to balance business\ngoals with craft by shipping continuous improvements and avoiding the\nperfection trap.\n\n## The Design Engineering toolbox\n\nThere\u2019s no fixed toolset for a Design Engineer. There\u2019s no best background.\nEveryone has different origins and has accumulated good taste. This diversity\nis essential because everyone\u2019s skills complement the team.\n\nWhile no individual is expected to have all the skills, the team collectively\nis able to execute on ambitious designs because we can:\n\n  * Design in Figma\n  * Design in code\n  * Write production code\n  * Debug browser performance\n  * Write GLSL shaders\n  * Write copy\n  * Create 3D experiences with Three.js\n  * Create 3D models/scenes in Blender\n  * Edit videos using CGI and practical camera effects\n\nWe collaborate on everything because of each person\u2019s unique background and\nskills. While each person can execute independently, we\u2019ve found that our best\nwork is done through collaboration. None of us is process/tools-driven. We\ncare about the outcome, not the process/tool.\n\n## Examples of Design Engineering\n\nYou can see our team\u2019s work across Vercel:\n\n  * Creating and maintaining components for the internal design system used on everything from Vercel.com to the Vercel Toolbar and the Next.js documentation.\n  * Websites like the Next.js Conf website and Vercel\u2019s product pages.\n  * Product work and docs for Vercel and Next.js.\n  * Building proof of concepts for branding and marketing.\n  * Improving the accessibility of all Vercel web properties.\n\n## Join Vercel\n\nDesign Engineering at Vercel means more than being a designer and an engineer.\nIt\u2019s about shifting from owning a specific part of the product development\nprocess to owning results.\n\nInterested? We\u2019re hiring Design Engineers. Apply even if you\u2019ve never had the\nDesign Engineer title. As you\u2019ve read, there\u2019s no correct background or skills\nfor a Design Engineer.
