But these headlines come with a serious new warning for\nthe billion of you with iMessage on your iPhones and for all the Android users\nyou know...\n\nBeware this latest imitation\n\nNurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nUpdated 04/09; originally published 04/07.\n\nAs excitement builds ahead of Apple\u2019s WWDC in June, with firmer detail on iOS\n18 due for release in the fall, one thing that seems fairly certain is the\nsignificant change to iMessage. But as I\u2019ve reported before, the adoption of\nRCS alongside iMessage is not the fix that many want it to be. The green\nbubble problem is not going away.\n\nWe\u2019ve just had a stark reminder of exactly that, with the latest bridge from\nApple\u2019s to Google\u2019s walled gardens. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen this\nparticular app propose itself as the solution\u2014last time it disappeared under a\nvery dark security cloud. But now, as Android Central succinctly puts it, \u201cthe\nprivacy disaster Sunbird is coming back.\u201d\n\nSunbird operates as a relay between Android devices and Apple\u2019s ecosystem,\nessentially converting Android-oriented texts into iMessages when received by\nApple devices, and vice versa. As such, those texts appear as blue bubbles.\n\nMORE FROM FORBESGoogle Suddenly Issues New Warning Ahead Of iPhone's iOS 18\nUpdateBy Zak Doffman\n\nBecause of the relay system, Apple sees these texts as end-to-end encrypted\niMessages. But they\u2019re not. Because the relay machine belongs to Sunbird and\nnot the end user. Sunbird says the relay is in memory only, and no messages or\ncredentials are stored on their servers. But they have control over the data\nand the technical ability to change how it\u2019s handled, which defeats the\nassurance of end-to-end encryption.\n\nApp-wise, Sunbird is just an Android platform. Users don\u2019t need any Apple\ndevices of their own\u2014Sunbird handles that side. In essence it\u2019s literally a\nbridge, with the Android user interfacing to Sunbird, and Sunbird into Apple\u2019s\necosystem.\n\nAn iMessage user seeing those blue bubbles will believe the conversation is\nend-to-end encrypted. But it isn\u2019t. The actual endpoint is outside that\nencryption. This is exactly what WhatsApp meant when it warned that to\nproperly assure end-to-end encryption, a platform needs control of both\nendpoints as well as transmission.\n\nSunbird says it \u201cenables secure communication within Apple's ecosystem,\u201d which\nis true. But the Android user is physically outside that ecosystem. Because\ndelivering blue bubbles from Android devices is this convoluted, is the very\nreason you should stop sending texts outside iMessage until there\u2019s a proper\nsolution to end-to-end encryption cross-platform\u2014if that ever happens.\n\nSunbird\u2019s return is aptly timed for Easter, and comes by way of a formal press\nrelease and a website refresh. The release is part mea culpa for what went\nwrong in 2022 and a promise of a bright and much improved future. Of note\ngiven iOS 18, the refresh is built around RCS rather than a homegrown\narchitecture.\n\n\u201cFollowing reports of security vulnerabilities in the Sunbird platform last\nNovember,\u201d Sunbird\u2019s developers said in an expanded release on April 5, \u201cwe're\ntaking this opportunity to update you on our findings, the current status, and\nour approach to remediating these issues in the upcoming relaunch of the\nSunbird app.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no app to download and install from Play Store or anywhere else at\nthis stage\u2014there\u2019s a waitlist which gives access to a limited beta. So this\nwill unfold slowly.\n\nThere\u2019s an explanation from Sunbird of why the new architecture is better than\nthe first, but there\u2019s also a tacit admission that the platform isn\u2019t even\ntrying to deliver the kind of quasi end-to-end encryption Beeper Mini tried\nfor last year. Interestingly, Sunbird actually suggests its lack of end-to-end\nencryption is a security plus:\n\n\u201cApple's decision in December,\u201d Sunbird suggests, \u201cto shut down a different\nunified messaging app brought to light security and privacy concerns stemming\nfrom their unauthorized access to iMessage.\u201d You\u2019ll recall the game of cat and\nmouse that Apple and Beeper played, as backdoor after backdoor was slammed\nshut. Beeper\u2019s intent was to insert itself into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, to\npiggyback on its encryption. Apple deemed that a security risk and the latest\nBeeper iteration doesn\u2019t even try.\n\n\u201cThe app shut down by Apple,\u201d Sunbird says, \u201cwas reverse engineering the\niMessage protocol to disguise itself as a genuine iMessage client, a method\nthat significantly differs from Sunbird's approach. Instead, Sunbird's\nplatform provides a bridge between Android and Apple users, enabling secure\ncommunication within Apple's ecosystem.\u201d Whatever that security solution is,\nit\u2019s not end-to-end encryption.\n\nMORE FROM FORBESWhatsApp Deadline-72 Hours To Accept New Terms Or Delete Your\nAccountBy Zak Doffman\n\nSunbird\u2019s security holes, as now laid out, go to show why messing around with\nsub-scale messaging platforms is a risky venture. Messages in transit were not\nfully secure and could potentially be open to unauthorized access, and users\ncould potentially be spoofed, albeit Sunbird says credentials remained secure.\nNow it has decided to rearchitect ground-up, using a more traditional solution\nbuilt on RCS.\n\nBut the issue for Sunbird becomes a why, rather than a what. The whole point\nof iMessage is its level of security, now replicated by Google Messages. Pull\npeople out of that protection and you might as well wait for Apple\u2019s RCS\ndeployment with iOS 18 in the fall. That will essentially do the same, albeit\nbacked by bluechip platforms. Is RCS with basic client-server encryption any\nless secure than Sunbird\u2014not really.\n\nApple\u2019s RCS deployment won\u2019t be end-to-end encrypted, and so doesn\u2019t fix the\nblue-bubble issue. Sunbird can color its bubbles any way it likes, but end-to-\nend encryption is a binary, and its solution isn\u2019t. As such, the bubbles\nshould be green\u2014just as we assume Google Messages will be, even under RCS.\n\nAnd so back to that stark reminder. Unless Apple either collaborates with\nGoogle to create an end-to-end encrypted cross-platform layer atop RCS, or\nApple develops an Android app, or Apple opens its SMS/RCS API to enable Google\nMessages to create an iOS app, there will be no cross-platform, secure\nmessaging between iPhone and Android that doesn\u2019t involve an over-the-top,\nstandalone messaging platform.\n\niMessage is an excellent platform\u2014as long as everyone is using it. There is no\nsecure alternative. You should stop texting other SMS clients or to unified\nmessengers with iMessage conduits. iMessage should just be for iMessages.\n\nContinue to use iMessage for OTPs and where your friends and family also live\ninside Apple\u2019s walled garden\u2014a long list if you\u2019re in the US and a shorter\nlist elsewhere. But for everything else, use a cross-platform alternative that\nis end-to-end encrypted.\n\nYou have plenty of choice\u2014WhatsApp, Signal, even Facebook Messenger. But not a\nthird-party relay to iMessage\u2014because even if it delivers exactly as promised,\nit\u2019s simply not as secure as the alternatives and\u2014absent a complete change of\napproach from Apple or a new RCS protocol\u2014it never can be.\n\nMORE FROM FORBESWhy You Should Change Your iPhone Settings To Secure Your\nPhotosBy Zak Doffman\n\n04/09 update: Unsurprisingly, the response to Sunbird\u2019s return on purely\nsecurity and privacy grounds has been fairly stark. Apple Insider says\n\u201castoundingly unsafe iMessage bridge Sunbird is back,\u201d advising users that\n\u201cyou still shouldn't use it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, focusing on the need to share credentials to make Sunbird work, The\nMac Observer says \u201cgiving your Apple ID credentials to a third-party company\nis never a smart idea, and Sunbird has shown to be quite dangerous in the\npast.\u201d\n\nBut equally unsurprisingly, the general tech response is one of curiosity and\nreflects the interest in any form of linkage or bridge between Android and\niMessage. And it\u2019s this general interest that Sunbird is playing into and\nwhich others will follow.\n\nAndroid Headlines advises users to proceed carefully but not to altogether\navoid the app, \u201cthough admitting that there were indeed security breaches in\nthe past years leading to a loss of faith by customers, Sunbird has chosen to\nfocus on offering security and openness while reinitiating its services. The\ncompany\u2019s efforts to fix its flaws and tighten security demonstrate that\nSunbird is keen on ensuring secure messaging systems for its users... Users\nwill closely watch Sunbird\u2019s actions as it comes back into the market and make\nsure that it complies with strict safety regulations related to personal data\nand communication privacy.\u201d\n\nPhone Arena provides a link to Sunbird\u2019s wait list, and says \u201cyou might wonder\nwhy this is necessary if Apple will support RCS later this year. The answer is\nsimple; despite Apple adding support for RCS, those using the latter will\nstill have green text bubbles. For those Android users concerned about getting\nteased for being green, outside of buying an iPhone, using Sunbird might be\nthe next best solution.\u201d\n\nWhether users elect to take the risk remains to be seen\u2014but given what\nhappened last time, it\u2019s almost certain that Sunbird will get plenty of\ntakers. Those that do are electing to take a risk, the issue is then more for\nthe Apple iMessage users they\u2019re communicating with, who will have no idea\nthat Sunbird is in play.\n\n\u201cI wish there was some kind of warning when an Android user is communicating\nwith us using this,\u201d says one commenter on Apple Insider, \u201cthat way we can be\nmore guarded in communications or even refuse to dialog in that format.\u201d\n\nWhile another points out the obvious, \u201cAndroid users are willing to put their\nsecurity at genuine risk for the sake of blue bubbles when messaging so they\ncan pretend they have an iPhone?! This is really a thing?! Look: I've always\nbeen an iPhone guy, but if you prefer Android, have at it! Makes no difference\nto me. I don't think less of you because your message bubbles are green.\u201d\n\nAnd that point highlights the double-edge sword Apple has created for itself\nand its iMessage users\u2014which to an extent is what was being pointed out by\nDOJ. The blue bubble envy is unique in the world of smartphones and messaging\nplatforms, and is an especial issue in the US, where iPhones dominate and the\nblue bubble syndrome is a factor amongst groups of Gen Z friends. Beyond the\nUS, we\u2019re all mostly using WhatsApp and so this isn\u2019t a factor.\n\nAnd so all eyes on iOS 18 and the expected deployment of RCS, which on the one\nhand will address the issue but on the other won\u2019t\u2014because while there will\nfinally be more advanced stock messaging between Android and iPhone, the\nbubbles from Android devices are expected to remain green. They won\u2019t be end-\nto-end encrypted, and so that\u2019s right given Apple\u2019s architecture, but those\nmessages are arguably more secure than the convoluted relay encryption in use\nhere.\n\nThe general security of RCS has not been a factor yet for Apple users who have\niMessage, SMS or over-the-tops. But Android users are already well versed in\nits pros and cons. With the major con being ads and spam, as email-type\nbehaviors meet messaging, with enhanced \u201cviewability\u201d given the immediacy of\nthose messages, even from unknown numbers.\n\nAnd it\u2019s with that in mind that we have seen Google beta release a warning for\nits current RCS users within Google Messages, that clicking a link from an\nunknown number means accepting the risk it could cause them harm. That\u2019s an\narea Apple will need to address in the fall as it brings another billion-plus\nusers onto into RCS.\n\nPiunikaweb, which just reported the beta warning, even suggested that Google\nis likely doing this \u201cto secure the platform in as many ways it can before RCS\ngoes live to millions of iPhone users, which invariably will result in even\nmore spam links.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the case\u2014but certainly if RCS isn\u2019t to land pancake flat\nwhen it goes live on iPhones and find itself switched off, the platforms will\nneed to address the uncontrollable deluge of spam that seems to have clouded\nRCS thus far.\n\nFailing to do so might be yet another reason users look to third-parties like\nSunbird to fix the problem instead.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\n\nZak Doffman\n\nZak is a widely recognized expert on surveillance, cyber and the\n\n...\n\n  * Editorial Standards\n  * Print\n  * Reprints & Permissions\n\n", "frontpage": false}
