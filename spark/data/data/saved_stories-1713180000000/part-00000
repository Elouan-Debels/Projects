Donaldson\n\nApr 10, 2024\n\nRELEASE24-052\n\n### NASA Headquarters\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson, left, and Japan\u2019s Minister of Education,\nCulture, Sports, Science and Technology Masahito Moriyama, hold signed copies\nof an historic agreement between the United States and Japan to advance\nsustainable human exploration of the Moon, Tuesday, April 9, 2024, at the NASA\nHeadquarters Mary W. Jackson Building in Washington. Under the agreement,\nJapan will design, develop, and operate a pressurized rover for crewed and\nuncrewed exploration on the Moon. NASA will provide the launch and delivery of\nthe rover to the Moon as well as two Japanese astronaut missions to the lunar\nsurface. Photo Credit: (NASA/Bill Ingalls)\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Japan\u2019s Minister of Education, Culture,\nSports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Masahito Moriyama have signed an\nagreement to advance sustainable human exploration of the Moon.\n\nJapan will design, develop, and operate a pressurized rover for crewed and\nuncrewed exploration on the Moon. NASA will provide the launch and delivery of\nthe rover to the Moon as well as two opportunities for Japanese astronauts to\ntravel to the lunar surface.\n\nToday, President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida also announced, \u201ca shared\ngoal for a Japanese national to be the first non-American astronaut to land on\nthe Moon on a future Artemis mission, assuming important benchmarks are\nachieved.\u201d\n\nThe pressurized lunar rover is intended to enable astronauts to travel farther\nand work for longer periods on the lunar surface. The signing took place April\n9 at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Along with Nelson and Moriyama, JAXA\n(Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) President Hiroshi Yamakawa also\nparticipated in the signing.\n\n\u201cThe quest for the stars is led by nations that explore the cosmos openly, in\npeace, and together. This is true for the United States and Japan under the\nleadership of President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida,\u201d said Nelson.\n\u201cAmerica no longer will walk on the Moon alone. With this new rover, we will\nuncover groundbreaking discoveries on the lunar surface that will benefit\nhumanity and inspire the Artemis Generation.\u201d\n\nAn enclosed and pressurized rover will enable astronauts to travel farther and\nconduct science in geographically diverse areas by serving as a mobile habitat\nand laboratory for the astronauts to live and work for extended periods of\ntime. It will be able to accommodate two astronauts for up to 30 days as they\ntraverse the area near the lunar South Pole. NASA currently plans to use the\npressurized rover on Artemis VII and subsequent missions over an approximate\n10-year lifespan.\n\n\u201cIt was an honor to sign the historic implementing arrangement that will be\nlong remembered as the symbol of the new era of Japan-U.S. partnership for the\nlunar exploration,\u201d said Moriyama. \u201cUnder the partnership stronger than ever,\nwe will drive the initiative together with JAXA, including the development of\nthe pressurized rover that vastly extends the exploration capability on the\nlunar surface, to realize the shared goal for Japanese and American astronauts\nto, together, explore the moon.\u201d\n\nThe arrangement falls under the \u201cFramework Agreement Between the Government of\nJapan and the Government of the United States of America for Cooperation in\nSpace Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other\nCelestial Bodies, For Peaceful Purposes,\u201d which was signed in January 2023 and\nrecognizes the nations\u2019 mutual interest in peaceful exploration.\n\nThe framework agreement facilitates a broad swath of joint activities between\nthe countries, including space science, Earth science, space operations and\nexploration, aeronautical science and technology, space technology, space\ntransportation, safety, and mission assurance, and much more. In addition to\nthe agreement for lunar surface exploration, the partners will build on the\nframework agreement with future agreements for Japan\u2019s participation in NASA\u2019s\nDragonfly mission and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The U.S. and\nJapan also intend to collaborate on JAXA\u2019s Next-generation Solar-observing\nSatellite, SOLAR-C, which will investigate the mysteries of solar atmospheres\nby conducting observations of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.\n\n\u201cThe pressurized rover will be a powerful contribution to the overall Artemis\narchitecture as Japan and the U.S. go hand in hand with international and\nindustry partners to the lunar surface and beyond,\u201d said Yamakawa. \u201cJAXA is\nready to assist MEXT and push this forward with our science and technological\nexpertise to establish sustainable human presence on the Moon.\u201d\n\nUnder the Gateway Implementing Arrangement signed in 2022, NASA will also\nprovide an opportunity for a Japanese astronaut to serve as a Gateway crew\nmember on a future Artemis mission and Japan will provide Gateway\u2019s\nenvironmental control and life support systems and cargo transportation.\n\nThrough Artemis, NASA will land the first woman, first person of color, and\nits first international partner astronaut on the Moon, make new scientific\ndiscoveries, and explore more of the lunar surface than ever before for the\nbenefit of all.\n\nLearn more about NASA\u2019s Artemis campaign at:\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/artemis\n\n\u2013 end-\n\nFaith McKie / Kathryn Hambleton Headquarters, Washington 202-358-1600\nfaith.d.mckie@nasa.gov / kathryn.hambleton@nasa.gov\n\n## Share\n\n## Details\n\nLast Updated\n\nApr 10, 2024\n\nLocation\n\nNASA Headquarters\n\n## Related Terms\n\n  * Missions\n  * Artemis\n\n### The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nNASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of\nhumanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n\n  * About NASA's Mission\n\nJoin Us\n\n  * Home\n  * News & Events\n  * Multimedia\n  * NASA+\n  * Missions\n  * Humans in Space\n  * Earth & Climate\n  * The Solar System\n  * The Universe\n  * Science\n  * Aeronautics\n  * Technology\n  * Learning Resources\n  * About NASA\n  * NASA en Espa\u00f1ol\n\n### Follow NASA\n\n  * More NASA Social Accounts\n  * NASA Newsletters\n\n  * Sitemap\n  * For Media\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * FOIA\n  * No FEAR Act\n  * Office of the IG\n  * Budget & Annual Reports\n  * Agency Financial Reports\n  * Contact NASA\n  * Accessibility\n\n  * Page Last Updated:\n\nApr 10, 2024\n\n  * Page Editor:\n\nAbbey A.
