The advertising is\npresented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change\nactions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that\nthey are in an urban zone.\n\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online\nadvertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its\naudience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and\navoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles\nabout how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been\npresented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose42 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adform\n  * Advanced store\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bannernow\n\n1-10 of 42\n\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\n\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit,\ncontent you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about\nyou (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and\nother websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or\nimprove a profile about you (that might include possible interests and\npersonal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present\nadvertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by\nthis and other entities.\n\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this\ninformation could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike\naccessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a\ndifferent website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike\naccessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury\ncar manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your\ninterest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are\ninterested in luxury cycling gear.\n\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It\ngets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income\ncustomers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create\nprofiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to\nhave a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising\nwithin partner apps based on those profiles.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose129 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n  * AdTiming\n\n1-10 of 129\n\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\n\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising\nprofiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or\napps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and\npersonal aspects.\n\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It\nwants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on\nits mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have\npreviously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present\nyou with the corresponding advertisement on the app.\n\nA profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having\nsearched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant\nadvertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose127 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * A.Mob\n  * ADventori\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdElement Media Solutions\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * AdSpirit AdServer\n  * AdTheorent\n\n1-10 of 127\n\nMeasure advertising performance\n\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you\ninteract with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for\nyou or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For\ninstance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you\nto buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand\nthe relevance of advertising campaigns.\n\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a \u201cblack Friday\u201d discount by an\nonline shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click\nwill be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will\nbe measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\n\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an\n\u201cinternational appreciation day\u201d discount by an online gift shop within the\napp of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how\noften a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the \u201cinternational\nappreciation day\u201d ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in\norder to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad\nplacements.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose76 vendor(s)\n\n  * 6sense\n  * Aarki\n  * AcuityAds\n  * AdGear\n  * AdKernel\n  * Adelaide\n  * Adform\n  * Adikteev\n  * Adloox\n  * Adnami\n\n1-10 of 76\n\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different\nsources\n\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user\nprofiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your\ninteractions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising)\ncontent to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which\ntarget audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\n\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the\nproportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or\nconsulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as\nthe average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data\nrelating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics\nis then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\n\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with\nits adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics\nof users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of\nsimilar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the\nadvertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile\ndevices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.\n\nVendors we use for this purpose28 vendor(s)\n\n  * AdGear\n  * Amazon Ad Server\n  * Amobee (Nexxen)\n  * Appier\n  * AudienceProject\n  * Bombora\n  * Clinch\n  * Crimtan\n  * Emerse\n  * Google Ads\n\n1-10 of 28\n\nDevelop and improve services\n\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with\nads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to\nbuild new products and services based on user interactions, the type of\naudience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or\nimprovement of user profiles and identifiers.\n\nA technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in\nmobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are\nconnecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads\nthat are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve\ntheir performance.\n\nAn advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer\ndevice.

This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nAfter failing for decades to cut carbon emissions enough to stop the planet\nfrom dangerously overheating, scientists are increasingly looking at backup\nmeasures, some that would fight the warming by intervening in the climate\nitself. Today, my colleague Christopher Flavelle on the efforts to engineer\nour way out of the climate crisis.\n\nIt\u2019s Friday, April 5.\n\nSo, Chris, you\u2019ve been covering climate change for a while, but recently\nyou\u2019ve been focused on a very special project. Tell us about this.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nYeah, two things have been happening in climate change recently that are\nreally important. Number one, records have been falling at alarming rates.\nLast year was, again, the hottest year on record. Much the world surpassed the\nimportant threshold of 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. So the\nworld is getting warmer at an alarming rate.\n\nAt the same time, emissions aren\u2019t falling. The message of the last generation\nhas been, we need to cut emissions really to almost zero by the end of this\ncentury. And in fact, the reverse is happening. Emissions are continuing to\nrise.\n\nAt the same time, the number and characteristics of weather disasters have\nbecome really alarming. So the effects of that warming have become really\nclear. And it\u2019s clear that the world is struggling to adapt to those effects.\n\nSo the other thing that\u2019s happening at a high level is there\u2019s more research\nand more consideration of OK, what if we can\u2019t cut emissions fast enough? What\nif we\u2019re going to have this really severe degree of warming? Can we do\nsomething else, maybe temporarily, to buffer those effects? And that\u2019s led to\nthis question of, what kinds of changes can we make deliberately to the\natmosphere, to the environment that will maybe produce some sort of artificial\ncooling in the meantime?\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nSo earlier this week I was able to watch, as scientists did, the first outdoor\ntests in the US on a technology that will aim to do just that. It\u2019s called\nmarine cloud brightening.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nSo what is this idea of brightening the clouds? Where did it originally come\nfrom?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nSo everyone I talked to pointed back to one really important moment in 1990\nwhen a British physicist named John Latham was taking a hike in Wales with his\nyoung son. And they were looking out at the clouds over the Irish Sea.\n\nAnd as Dr. Latham later told it, his son asked him, \u201cHey, why are clouds\nbright?\u201d And Dr. Latham said, \u201cWell, because they reflect sun right back in\nthe sky.\u201d And his son said, \u201cSo they\u2019re like soggy mirrors.\u201d\n\nAnd Dr. Latham went on to write a letter in 1990 that was published in the\nJournal Nature, saying, you know what, if we can deliberately manipulate these\nclouds, maybe we can make them more reflective and actually counteract the\neffects of global warming. That was the inception point for this idea, and it\nled to decades of research culminating in this week\u2019s test.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nSo the idea is if you can make clouds more reflective, you can reflect more of\nthe sun\u2019s heat back into space. So it won\u2019t get trapped in the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere in the first place.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nExactly. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nThat\u2019s a very simple, and at the same time, a very powerful idea. I love\nactually that they were hiking in Wales. That\u2019s where I am right now, and we\nsure have a lot of clouds here, rain clouds. But tell me more about what you\nsaw at the testing site.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nSo this Tuesday, a little after 7:00 in the morning, I pulled up in a parking\nlot on a dock at the edge of Alameda.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nI\u2019m standing at the gangplank to the USS Hornet, a decommissioned aircraft\ncarrier in San Francisco Bay here for the first test in the US of a machine\nthat was designed to try to brighten clouds, a way of maybe temporarily\ncooling the Earth.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd I made my way up one of the massive gangplanks and came in to find a\ncluster of some of the top atmospheric scientists in the world.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nChris.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nHave you met Sarah?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nHow do you do?\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nHi, Rob. How are you?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nLooking really excited. And they accompanied me out to the flight deck \u2014\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nHere we are.\n\n\u2014 of this aircraft carrier.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nOh, man.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nPretty epic.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nIt\u2019s pretty great.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWhich was a bit like a party. They\u2019d set up a little table on the side with\nsome coffee and some sandwiches, and people were chatting and saying hi to\neach other. And I asked them why they were excited.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nSo I know a thousand of what you know, and I still find this exciting. You\nguys, walk me through. Is this like a big day for you or just like one more\ntest?\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nNo, this is a big day for me.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd they said this was actually a huge day in their research.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nJust looking at it, going, yeah, this is the culmination of years of work,\nright?\n\nYeah.\n\nOr not.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nWow, and tell me about what exactly they were so excited about and what they\nwere doing on the ship.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nYeah, the thing everyone was excited about was this machine set up at the far\nend of the flight deck of this aircraft carrier. It\u2019s blue. It\u2019s shiny. It\nlooks a bit like a snow maker or maybe like a spotlight.\n\nThis machine is a sprayer. What it does is it sprays really, really, really\nsmall aerosol particles, in this case, smashed up sea salts, a long distance\nat just the right size and just the right volume. Because in theory, at some\npoint, you could use this machine to change the size and number of the\ndroplets in the clouds. You can make them brighter conceptually it\u2019s possible.\nThe question is, technologically, can we do it?\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nYeah, the particles are coming out in a super concentrated there. So\nwhatever\u2019s coming out of that circle there is basically going to be huge by\nthe time it gets to the cloud.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nRight. OK.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nSo \u2014\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd so the goal with this test was they spent years building this sprayer that\ncan use really high pressured air to smash salt particles into super small\nbits, about 1,700th the size of a human hair.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nWow.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWhat they didn\u2019t know, until this week, and they\u2019re trying to find out right\nnow, once you spray it, do those aerosols that are so finely tuned stay that\nsize? In theory, they should.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t know is, things like wind and humidity and temperature could\npotentially cause them to coagulate, to regroup, which would throw the whole\nthing off. If the aerosols you\u2019re shooting into clouds are too big, you can\nbackfire the whole purpose. You can wreck what you\u2019re trying to do because you\nmake clouds less reflective, not more reflective.\n\nSo the whole goal of the experiment is, OK, can they make the spray just so,\nso that even in outdoor conditions, the aerosols that are so finely sized\nremain the size you want them to be. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to find\nout.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nAnd you watched the actual test of this. What did you see? What happened?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nThose instruments are emitting a slight hum.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nSo operating the sprayer is not straightforward.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd they\u2019re filling the tanks with the salt water that\u2019ll be used to produce\nthe mist.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nThere was somebody crouched on the control deck, the panel of instruments at\nthe side of the sprayer. So I went over and tried to sit next to him and watch\nhim as he turned a series of knobs and careful sequence.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nOK. Yeah, everybody, we\u2019re going to run some air. So the \u2014 ... We need two\nminutes here just to have power on this.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd after a series of tests to make sure the valves were clear \u2014\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nOK, ear protection, please.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\n\u2014 finally the moment came, and he got an all clear over his walkie-talkie. And\nhe turned on the water \u2014\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nWater on, copy, over.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\n\u2014 and the air.\n\n[COMPRESSOR ACTIVATING]\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nSince the sound of the compressor pushes pressurized air through the sprayer,\nit\u2019s making a dull, throbbing sensation. You can feel it a little bit through\nthe deck of the ship.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWe all had ear protectors. And even with the ear protectors, it was really\nloud. And then you can almost feel the spray bursting out of this machine and\nwatch it travel really hundreds of feet down the deck of the aircraft carrier.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nOK, water off, fan off. Good job.\n\nAwesome, guys, you\u2019re done. Thank you. Excellent.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nFirst test is done.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nMy first signal that things have gone well was I looked up when the spraying\nmachine was turned off and saw some scientists high-fiving down the deck.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWhat\u2019d you think?\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nIt\u2019s beautiful.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nIs it what you thought it would be?\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nIt\u2019s better. And I\u2019m optimistic that it will tell us a lot about what these\nthings do. This made me really optimistic.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd the idea is to do several short bursts like that through the day?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd everyone seemed really excited that this thing they\u2019d worked on for years\nwas finally happening in this really important outdoor test.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nOK, so it sounds like this test was a success.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nYeah, they stressed that they need a lot of time to really go over the\nresults. They\u2019ll be doing this test again and again in different weather\nconditions. But the initial reaction seemed positive. They seemed to think\nthat the numbers they were getting were what they were hoping to see.\n\nAnd so now the goal is, can they maintain the right size aerosols even in\ndifferent conditions down the deck of this aircraft carrier? That\u2019ll give them\nsome confidence that if they decided one day to try and do this on the open\nocean to actually brighten clouds, they\u2019d have the ability to do it.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nSo, Chris, if all of this works, how and when do these researchers anticipate\nthat this would actually be used?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWell, here\u2019s a great example. In the month of February, a version of this\ntesting was also happening in Australia, off the Coast of Australia, where\nresearchers were testing whether marine cloud brightening could be used to\ncool the ocean just a little bit around the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nReally high ocean temperatures are causing bleaching of that coral reef. The\nidea was, could they use marine cloud brightening to save some of those reefs\nfrom dying? And that\u2019s probably a good idea of the fairly localized situation,\nwhere you could, in theory if you do it right, have a fairly quick degree of\ncooling that could maybe try to avert or mitigate something pretty acute like\na heat wave or a stretch of warm weather that would kill coral. But the\nscience is probably too new at this point to talk about the right situations\nto use it. Those conversations are all down the road as researchers look at\nthese and other ideas for what they could do if things get really bad.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\n\nSo, Chris, when I think about solutions to climate change, it usually involves\nthese very hard things we need to do, like, change the way we live, the way we\ndrive, what we eat. We need these international treaties. We need carbon taxes\nregulation. There\u2019s lots of hard stuff, and we haven\u2019t gotten that far.\n\nBut here you\u2019ve just told me about this technology that, if it ends up\nworking, could actually help cool the planet without anyone needing to do any\nof these hard things. It sounds great.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nIt does sound great. Now, we\u2019ve got to say, first of all that whenever anybody\nworking on this stuff talks about it, the first thing they say is this is not\nan alternative to reducing emissions. This is looking for ways to buy time as\nwe try to cut emissions. There\u2019s no way to really deal with climate change\nthat doesn\u2019t entail burning less fossil fuel and quickly.\n\nBut yes, in addition to brightening clouds, there\u2019s other ways to try to\nbounce more sunlight back into space and other ideas. My colleague David\nGelles wrote the first piece in our series looking the idea of removing carbon\ndioxide directly from the air, reversing our past emissions.\n\nOther ideas include finding ways to suck up more of the CO2 in the oceans.\nThere\u2019s even ideas that my colleague Cara Buckley covered of could we build a\nsort of a giant parasol way out in space that would reflect or scatter more of\nthe sunlight and prevent some of that sunlight from even reaching the Earth in\nthe first place?\n\nSo there\u2019s a huge number of ideas that until very recently seemed just so\nbizarre and/or so expensive and/or so dangerous that they were hardly worth\npursuing seriously. And what\u2019s changed really quickly in the last really year\nor two is all of a sudden those ideas have switched from being too wild to\nspend much time on to being so important because the situation is so dire that\nwe can\u2019t not look at them. And that\u2019s the pivot that my team has been trying\nto cover.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nAnd what characterizes all these initiatives is that rather than reducing our\nown emissions, we\u2019re now trying to intervene in the climate in a proactive\nway, engineering the climate in a way.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nYes, and you hear the phrase geoengineering to describe these ideas\ncollectively. And what people who research this will stress is, we\u2019re already\ngeoengineering. For more than a century, we\u2019ve been geoengineering in the\nsense of putting climate changing pollution into the atmosphere that\u2019s caused\nthe planet to change by trapping more heat in the atmosphere. So the question\nis, do we want to deliberately geoengineer in a way that will ease that\npressure rather than just making it worse?\n\nOf course, there some controversy attached to this. And there are some pretty\nvalid concerns about what the consequences might be if we keep on pursuing\nthese ideas.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nAnd why are they controversial?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWell, the first concern that you hear is this idea of moral hazard, that if\npeople come to think that there are ways of addressing climate change that\ndon\u2019t require them to change their lifestyle or sacrifice conveniences or\nchange the kinds of cars they drive or how their power is generated that they\nwill lose interest in those tough changes. And the momentum, such as it is,\ntowards cutting emissions will fade even more. But we don\u2019t know yet whether\npoliticians or governments or companies or just people will misuse these ideas\nto try to shirk the harder work of reducing the amount of greenhouse gases we\nemit.\n\nAnother really important argument you hear is, OK, side effects. Do we really\nknow what would happen if we tried these things? Marine cloud brightening is\none of those situations where there are known unknowns and unknown unknowns,\nas they say.\n\nThe known unknowns are, well, what would happen to things like ocean\ncirculation? What would happen to precipitation? What would happen to the\neffect on the amount of energy reaching the ocean? What would happen to the\nfisheries industry? We don\u2019t really know, and researchers are trying to find\nout, what those effects might be.\n\nThen there are the unknown unknowns. If you start deliberately changing the\ncloud system, well, what else might happen that we haven\u2019t anticipated? Do you\nmove the location of where rainfall happens? Do you perhaps upset the monsoon\ncycle in India? Do you change the ability to grow food in parts of the world?\n\nSo if you do this at a bigger scale, the consequences of those potential side\neffects get more and more severe. And I talked to environmentalists who said\nthat\u2019s a real concern. You just can\u2019t model those risks. And you, to a degree,\nby pursuing this, have to accept that risk is real and almost roll the dice.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nAnd I guess much like climate change, where you have a group of countries that\nis most responsible for CO2 emissions that have caused the global warming and\nthen a whole other group of countries that are probably suffering the worst\nconsequences, even though they haven\u2019t contributed to those emissions nearly\nas much, you might see a situation where this kind of interference with the\nclimate at the initiative of some countries, presumably the wealthy countries\nthat have that technology, would then have unintended consequences in\ncountries that have no control over this. So that\u2019s tricky.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nThat\u2019s right. And that takes us to a third category of concerns, which is, OK,\nlet\u2019s assume that things are bad enough, that collectively societies want to\ntake those risks of those side effects. Well, then who chooses, who decides\nwhen we get to that point? Is there even a mechanism that would allow you to\nget informed consent from everybody who\u2019d be affected?\n\nAnd if these would affect everybody, it\u2019s hard to imagine how you would build\na governance mechanism that would allow you to say, before we push the button,\nare we sure everybody is OK with this? The only counter to all of these\nconcerns is compared to what? And this is the point that researchers make.\n\nOK, this is dangerous. OK, it presents challenges, but compared to what? Their\npoint is, don\u2019t compare it to a situation where everything\u2019s fine. Compare it\nto a situation we\u2019re actually in, where the trajectory of global warming is so\nserious and isn\u2019t looking like it\u2019ll get better any time soon. Well, compared\nto those risks, how do these risks compare?\n\nAnd the question is, would you rather have a world of basically uncontrolled\nwarming? And we have an idea of what that brings, wildfires and drought and\nsea level rise and storms and diseases. Is that better than some of these more\nperhaps controlled risks associated with deliberately tinkering with the\nenvironment?\n\nSo it\u2019s almost like pick your poison. What sort of threats do you want to\nembrace? And that\u2019s the overwhelming dilemma that we face with this\ntechnology.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nIn a way, what it makes me think, is that these crazy initiatives that we\u2019ve\nbeen hearing about from you are yes, they\u2019re testament to our failure in a way\nto combat climate change so far, because they\u2019re such a last resort, really,\nsuch as an act of desperation. But at the same time, it seems like this\nurgency has actually unleashed a lot of energy and money to tackle the\nproblem.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nYeah, and there\u2019s good news in this. The good news is, the research we\u2019re\ntalking about demonstrates the really amazing capacity of scientists to come\nup with new ideas, develop new technologies, test them quickly, and at least\nbuild some options.\n\nSo if there\u2019s any rays of hope around climate change, it\u2019s that humanity\u2019s\ncapacity to innovate and find new ideas is almost endless. So the question is\nnot, are we pursuing the wrong research ideas? The question is, can we find\ngood ideas fast enough to avert the really serious consequences of climate\nchange that we\u2019re already facing?\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nChris, I just remember that scientist we heard in the tape from your visit.\nAnd she was so excited. And she said that she was really optimistic. I wonder,\nhow are you feeling?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nI think the frustration that you\u2019ll hear among climate reporters, and I\u2019m in\nthis group, is that most people seem not to appreciate the severity of the\nsituation that we\u2019re in. There seems to be a view that we\u2019re dealing with\nthis. People are buying electric cars, and we\u2019re getting more solar power and\nwind power. And things are going the right way, and this will be OK.\n\nThings are not going the right way. Not only are we on the wrong trajectory in\nterms of emissions, we are so far away from being on the right trajectory for\nemissions that it\u2019s hard to imagine us cutting emissions globally at a rate\nanywhere near fast enough to avoid almost unbearable consequences of global\nwarming. So that\u2019s the downside.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] Here\u2019s the good news, though. I do think, and this again I\nthink is a view among other climate reporters, the capacity of scientists and\nof companies to change track and to find new products and apply new ideas is\nreally impressive. It just doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a connection yet between\nthe urgency of the situation and the way people and companies and governments\nare responding.\n\nAnd so I guess if the question is, how I feel about this? I am constantly\namazed at the ingenuity of the researchers I come across in my job every day.\nWhat I don\u2019t yet know about is whether or not society will move fast enough to\nadopt and apply those ideas before the conditions that we face from climate\nchange become almost unbearable.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nWell, Chris, on this cautiously optimistic note, thank you very much.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nThank you.\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know today. In a tense phone call with Israel\u2019s\nleader Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, President Biden called the airstrikes\nthat killed seven aid workers this week unacceptable and threatened to\ncondition future support for Israel on how it addresses concerns about\ncivilian casualties and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. It was the first time\nthat Biden explicitly sought to leverage American aid to influence Israel\u2019s\nconduct of the war against Hamas. But the White House stopped short of saying\ndirectly that the president would halt arms supplies or impose conditions on\ntheir use as some fellow Democrats have urged him to do.\n\nAnd a centrist group called No Labels has abandoned its plans to run a\npresidential ticket in this year\u2019s election after failing to recruit a\ncandidate. The group, which last year said it raised $60 million, had planned\nto put forward what it called a bipartisan unity ticket in the event of a\nrematch between President Biden and former President Trump but in recent\nmonths suffered a string of rejections from prominent Republicans and\nDemocrats who declined to run on its ticket.\n\nToday\u2019s episode was produced by Michael Simon Johnson, Eric Krupke, Luke\nVander Ploeg and Rachelle Bonja.

This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nAfter failing for decades to cut carbon emissions enough to stop the planet\nfrom dangerously overheating, scientists are increasingly looking at backup\nmeasures, some that would fight the warming by intervening in the climate\nitself. Today, my colleague Christopher Flavelle on the efforts to engineer\nour way out of the climate crisis.\n\nIt\u2019s Friday, April 5.\n\nSo, Chris, you\u2019ve been covering climate change for a while, but recently\nyou\u2019ve been focused on a very special project. Tell us about this.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nYeah, two things have been happening in climate change recently that are\nreally important. Number one, records have been falling at alarming rates.\nLast year was, again, the hottest year on record. Much the world surpassed the\nimportant threshold of 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. So the\nworld is getting warmer at an alarming rate.\n\nAt the same time, emissions aren\u2019t falling. The message of the last generation\nhas been, we need to cut emissions really to almost zero by the end of this\ncentury. And in fact, the reverse is happening. Emissions are continuing to\nrise.\n\nAt the same time, the number and characteristics of weather disasters have\nbecome really alarming. So the effects of that warming have become really\nclear. And it\u2019s clear that the world is struggling to adapt to those effects.\n\nSo the other thing that\u2019s happening at a high level is there\u2019s more research\nand more consideration of OK, what if we can\u2019t cut emissions fast enough? What\nif we\u2019re going to have this really severe degree of warming? Can we do\nsomething else, maybe temporarily, to buffer those effects? And that\u2019s led to\nthis question of, what kinds of changes can we make deliberately to the\natmosphere, to the environment that will maybe produce some sort of artificial\ncooling in the meantime?\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nSo earlier this week I was able to watch, as scientists did, the first outdoor\ntests in the US on a technology that will aim to do just that. It\u2019s called\nmarine cloud brightening.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nSo what is this idea of brightening the clouds? Where did it originally come\nfrom?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nSo everyone I talked to pointed back to one really important moment in 1990\nwhen a British physicist named John Latham was taking a hike in Wales with his\nyoung son. And they were looking out at the clouds over the Irish Sea.\n\nAnd as Dr. Latham later told it, his son asked him, \u201cHey, why are clouds\nbright?\u201d And Dr. Latham said, \u201cWell, because they reflect sun right back in\nthe sky.\u201d And his son said, \u201cSo they\u2019re like soggy mirrors.\u201d\n\nAnd Dr. Latham went on to write a letter in 1990 that was published in the\nJournal Nature, saying, you know what, if we can deliberately manipulate these\nclouds, maybe we can make them more reflective and actually counteract the\neffects of global warming. That was the inception point for this idea, and it\nled to decades of research culminating in this week\u2019s test.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nSo the idea is if you can make clouds more reflective, you can reflect more of\nthe sun\u2019s heat back into space. So it won\u2019t get trapped in the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere in the first place.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nExactly. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nThat\u2019s a very simple, and at the same time, a very powerful idea. I love\nactually that they were hiking in Wales. That\u2019s where I am right now, and we\nsure have a lot of clouds here, rain clouds. But tell me more about what you\nsaw at the testing site.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nSo this Tuesday, a little after 7:00 in the morning, I pulled up in a parking\nlot on a dock at the edge of Alameda.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nI\u2019m standing at the gangplank to the USS Hornet, a decommissioned aircraft\ncarrier in San Francisco Bay here for the first test in the US of a machine\nthat was designed to try to brighten clouds, a way of maybe temporarily\ncooling the Earth.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd I made my way up one of the massive gangplanks and came in to find a\ncluster of some of the top atmospheric scientists in the world.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nChris.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nHave you met Sarah?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nHow do you do?\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nHi, Rob. How are you?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nLooking really excited. And they accompanied me out to the flight deck \u2014\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nHere we are.\n\n\u2014 of this aircraft carrier.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nOh, man.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nPretty epic.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nIt\u2019s pretty great.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWhich was a bit like a party. They\u2019d set up a little table on the side with\nsome coffee and some sandwiches, and people were chatting and saying hi to\neach other. And I asked them why they were excited.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nSo I know a thousand of what you know, and I still find this exciting. You\nguys, walk me through. Is this like a big day for you or just like one more\ntest?\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nNo, this is a big day for me.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd they said this was actually a huge day in their research.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nJust looking at it, going, yeah, this is the culmination of years of work,\nright?\n\nYeah.\n\nOr not.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nWow, and tell me about what exactly they were so excited about and what they\nwere doing on the ship.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nYeah, the thing everyone was excited about was this machine set up at the far\nend of the flight deck of this aircraft carrier. It\u2019s blue. It\u2019s shiny. It\nlooks a bit like a snow maker or maybe like a spotlight.\n\nThis machine is a sprayer. What it does is it sprays really, really, really\nsmall aerosol particles, in this case, smashed up sea salts, a long distance\nat just the right size and just the right volume. Because in theory, at some\npoint, you could use this machine to change the size and number of the\ndroplets in the clouds. You can make them brighter conceptually it\u2019s possible.\nThe question is, technologically, can we do it?\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nYeah, the particles are coming out in a super concentrated there. So\nwhatever\u2019s coming out of that circle there is basically going to be huge by\nthe time it gets to the cloud.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nRight. OK.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nSo \u2014\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd so the goal with this test was they spent years building this sprayer that\ncan use really high pressured air to smash salt particles into super small\nbits, about 1,700th the size of a human hair.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nWow.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWhat they didn\u2019t know, until this week, and they\u2019re trying to find out right\nnow, once you spray it, do those aerosols that are so finely tuned stay that\nsize? In theory, they should.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t know is, things like wind and humidity and temperature could\npotentially cause them to coagulate, to regroup, which would throw the whole\nthing off. If the aerosols you\u2019re shooting into clouds are too big, you can\nbackfire the whole purpose. You can wreck what you\u2019re trying to do because you\nmake clouds less reflective, not more reflective.\n\nSo the whole goal of the experiment is, OK, can they make the spray just so,\nso that even in outdoor conditions, the aerosols that are so finely sized\nremain the size you want them to be. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to find\nout.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nAnd you watched the actual test of this. What did you see? What happened?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nThose instruments are emitting a slight hum.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nSo operating the sprayer is not straightforward.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd they\u2019re filling the tanks with the salt water that\u2019ll be used to produce\nthe mist.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nThere was somebody crouched on the control deck, the panel of instruments at\nthe side of the sprayer. So I went over and tried to sit next to him and watch\nhim as he turned a series of knobs and careful sequence.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nOK. Yeah, everybody, we\u2019re going to run some air. So the \u2014 ... We need two\nminutes here just to have power on this.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd after a series of tests to make sure the valves were clear \u2014\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nOK, ear protection, please.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\n\u2014 finally the moment came, and he got an all clear over his walkie-talkie. And\nhe turned on the water \u2014\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nWater on, copy, over.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\n\u2014 and the air.\n\n[COMPRESSOR ACTIVATING]\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nSince the sound of the compressor pushes pressurized air through the sprayer,\nit\u2019s making a dull, throbbing sensation. You can feel it a little bit through\nthe deck of the ship.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWe all had ear protectors. And even with the ear protectors, it was really\nloud. And then you can almost feel the spray bursting out of this machine and\nwatch it travel really hundreds of feet down the deck of the aircraft carrier.\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nOK, water off, fan off. Good job.\n\nAwesome, guys, you\u2019re done. Thank you. Excellent.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nFirst test is done.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nMy first signal that things have gone well was I looked up when the spraying\nmachine was turned off and saw some scientists high-fiving down the deck.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWhat\u2019d you think?\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nIt\u2019s beautiful.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nIs it what you thought it would be?\n\narchived recording\n\n    \n\nIt\u2019s better. And I\u2019m optimistic that it will tell us a lot about what these\nthings do. This made me really optimistic.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd the idea is to do several short bursts like that through the day?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nAnd everyone seemed really excited that this thing they\u2019d worked on for years\nwas finally happening in this really important outdoor test.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nOK, so it sounds like this test was a success.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nYeah, they stressed that they need a lot of time to really go over the\nresults. They\u2019ll be doing this test again and again in different weather\nconditions. But the initial reaction seemed positive. They seemed to think\nthat the numbers they were getting were what they were hoping to see.\n\nAnd so now the goal is, can they maintain the right size aerosols even in\ndifferent conditions down the deck of this aircraft carrier? That\u2019ll give them\nsome confidence that if they decided one day to try and do this on the open\nocean to actually brighten clouds, they\u2019d have the ability to do it.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nSo, Chris, if all of this works, how and when do these researchers anticipate\nthat this would actually be used?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWell, here\u2019s a great example. In the month of February, a version of this\ntesting was also happening in Australia, off the Coast of Australia, where\nresearchers were testing whether marine cloud brightening could be used to\ncool the ocean just a little bit around the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nReally high ocean temperatures are causing bleaching of that coral reef. The\nidea was, could they use marine cloud brightening to save some of those reefs\nfrom dying? And that\u2019s probably a good idea of the fairly localized situation,\nwhere you could, in theory if you do it right, have a fairly quick degree of\ncooling that could maybe try to avert or mitigate something pretty acute like\na heat wave or a stretch of warm weather that would kill coral. But the\nscience is probably too new at this point to talk about the right situations\nto use it. Those conversations are all down the road as researchers look at\nthese and other ideas for what they could do if things get really bad.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\n\nSo, Chris, when I think about solutions to climate change, it usually involves\nthese very hard things we need to do, like, change the way we live, the way we\ndrive, what we eat. We need these international treaties. We need carbon taxes\nregulation. There\u2019s lots of hard stuff, and we haven\u2019t gotten that far.\n\nBut here you\u2019ve just told me about this technology that, if it ends up\nworking, could actually help cool the planet without anyone needing to do any\nof these hard things. It sounds great.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nIt does sound great. Now, we\u2019ve got to say, first of all that whenever anybody\nworking on this stuff talks about it, the first thing they say is this is not\nan alternative to reducing emissions. This is looking for ways to buy time as\nwe try to cut emissions. There\u2019s no way to really deal with climate change\nthat doesn\u2019t entail burning less fossil fuel and quickly.\n\nBut yes, in addition to brightening clouds, there\u2019s other ways to try to\nbounce more sunlight back into space and other ideas. My colleague David\nGelles wrote the first piece in our series looking the idea of removing carbon\ndioxide directly from the air, reversing our past emissions.\n\nOther ideas include finding ways to suck up more of the CO2 in the oceans.\nThere\u2019s even ideas that my colleague Cara Buckley covered of could we build a\nsort of a giant parasol way out in space that would reflect or scatter more of\nthe sunlight and prevent some of that sunlight from even reaching the Earth in\nthe first place?\n\nSo there\u2019s a huge number of ideas that until very recently seemed just so\nbizarre and/or so expensive and/or so dangerous that they were hardly worth\npursuing seriously. And what\u2019s changed really quickly in the last really year\nor two is all of a sudden those ideas have switched from being too wild to\nspend much time on to being so important because the situation is so dire that\nwe can\u2019t not look at them. And that\u2019s the pivot that my team has been trying\nto cover.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nAnd what characterizes all these initiatives is that rather than reducing our\nown emissions, we\u2019re now trying to intervene in the climate in a proactive\nway, engineering the climate in a way.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nYes, and you hear the phrase geoengineering to describe these ideas\ncollectively. And what people who research this will stress is, we\u2019re already\ngeoengineering. For more than a century, we\u2019ve been geoengineering in the\nsense of putting climate changing pollution into the atmosphere that\u2019s caused\nthe planet to change by trapping more heat in the atmosphere. So the question\nis, do we want to deliberately geoengineer in a way that will ease that\npressure rather than just making it worse?\n\nOf course, there some controversy attached to this. And there are some pretty\nvalid concerns about what the consequences might be if we keep on pursuing\nthese ideas.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nAnd why are they controversial?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nWell, the first concern that you hear is this idea of moral hazard, that if\npeople come to think that there are ways of addressing climate change that\ndon\u2019t require them to change their lifestyle or sacrifice conveniences or\nchange the kinds of cars they drive or how their power is generated that they\nwill lose interest in those tough changes. And the momentum, such as it is,\ntowards cutting emissions will fade even more. But we don\u2019t know yet whether\npoliticians or governments or companies or just people will misuse these ideas\nto try to shirk the harder work of reducing the amount of greenhouse gases we\nemit.\n\nAnother really important argument you hear is, OK, side effects. Do we really\nknow what would happen if we tried these things? Marine cloud brightening is\none of those situations where there are known unknowns and unknown unknowns,\nas they say.\n\nThe known unknowns are, well, what would happen to things like ocean\ncirculation? What would happen to precipitation? What would happen to the\neffect on the amount of energy reaching the ocean? What would happen to the\nfisheries industry? We don\u2019t really know, and researchers are trying to find\nout, what those effects might be.\n\nThen there are the unknown unknowns. If you start deliberately changing the\ncloud system, well, what else might happen that we haven\u2019t anticipated? Do you\nmove the location of where rainfall happens? Do you perhaps upset the monsoon\ncycle in India? Do you change the ability to grow food in parts of the world?\n\nSo if you do this at a bigger scale, the consequences of those potential side\neffects get more and more severe. And I talked to environmentalists who said\nthat\u2019s a real concern. You just can\u2019t model those risks. And you, to a degree,\nby pursuing this, have to accept that risk is real and almost roll the dice.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nAnd I guess much like climate change, where you have a group of countries that\nis most responsible for CO2 emissions that have caused the global warming and\nthen a whole other group of countries that are probably suffering the worst\nconsequences, even though they haven\u2019t contributed to those emissions nearly\nas much, you might see a situation where this kind of interference with the\nclimate at the initiative of some countries, presumably the wealthy countries\nthat have that technology, would then have unintended consequences in\ncountries that have no control over this. So that\u2019s tricky.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nThat\u2019s right. And that takes us to a third category of concerns, which is, OK,\nlet\u2019s assume that things are bad enough, that collectively societies want to\ntake those risks of those side effects. Well, then who chooses, who decides\nwhen we get to that point? Is there even a mechanism that would allow you to\nget informed consent from everybody who\u2019d be affected?\n\nAnd if these would affect everybody, it\u2019s hard to imagine how you would build\na governance mechanism that would allow you to say, before we push the button,\nare we sure everybody is OK with this? The only counter to all of these\nconcerns is compared to what? And this is the point that researchers make.\n\nOK, this is dangerous. OK, it presents challenges, but compared to what? Their\npoint is, don\u2019t compare it to a situation where everything\u2019s fine. Compare it\nto a situation we\u2019re actually in, where the trajectory of global warming is so\nserious and isn\u2019t looking like it\u2019ll get better any time soon. Well, compared\nto those risks, how do these risks compare?\n\nAnd the question is, would you rather have a world of basically uncontrolled\nwarming? And we have an idea of what that brings, wildfires and drought and\nsea level rise and storms and diseases. Is that better than some of these more\nperhaps controlled risks associated with deliberately tinkering with the\nenvironment?\n\nSo it\u2019s almost like pick your poison. What sort of threats do you want to\nembrace? And that\u2019s the overwhelming dilemma that we face with this\ntechnology.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nIn a way, what it makes me think, is that these crazy initiatives that we\u2019ve\nbeen hearing about from you are yes, they\u2019re testament to our failure in a way\nto combat climate change so far, because they\u2019re such a last resort, really,\nsuch as an act of desperation. But at the same time, it seems like this\nurgency has actually unleashed a lot of energy and money to tackle the\nproblem.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nYeah, and there\u2019s good news in this. The good news is, the research we\u2019re\ntalking about demonstrates the really amazing capacity of scientists to come\nup with new ideas, develop new technologies, test them quickly, and at least\nbuild some options.\n\nSo if there\u2019s any rays of hope around climate change, it\u2019s that humanity\u2019s\ncapacity to innovate and find new ideas is almost endless. So the question is\nnot, are we pursuing the wrong research ideas? The question is, can we find\ngood ideas fast enough to avert the really serious consequences of climate\nchange that we\u2019re already facing?\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nChris, I just remember that scientist we heard in the tape from your visit.\nAnd she was so excited. And she said that she was really optimistic. I wonder,\nhow are you feeling?\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nI think the frustration that you\u2019ll hear among climate reporters, and I\u2019m in\nthis group, is that most people seem not to appreciate the severity of the\nsituation that we\u2019re in. There seems to be a view that we\u2019re dealing with\nthis. People are buying electric cars, and we\u2019re getting more solar power and\nwind power. And things are going the right way, and this will be OK.\n\nThings are not going the right way. Not only are we on the wrong trajectory in\nterms of emissions, we are so far away from being on the right trajectory for\nemissions that it\u2019s hard to imagine us cutting emissions globally at a rate\nanywhere near fast enough to avoid almost unbearable consequences of global\nwarming. So that\u2019s the downside.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING] Here\u2019s the good news, though. I do think, and this again I\nthink is a view among other climate reporters, the capacity of scientists and\nof companies to change track and to find new products and apply new ideas is\nreally impressive. It just doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a connection yet between\nthe urgency of the situation and the way people and companies and governments\nare responding.\n\nAnd so I guess if the question is, how I feel about this? I am constantly\namazed at the ingenuity of the researchers I come across in my job every day.\nWhat I don\u2019t yet know about is whether or not society will move fast enough to\nadopt and apply those ideas before the conditions that we face from climate\nchange become almost unbearable.\n\nkatrin bennhold\n\n    \n\nWell, Chris, on this cautiously optimistic note, thank you very much.\n\nchristopher flavell\n\n    \n\nThank you.\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back.\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know today. In a tense phone call with Israel\u2019s\nleader Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, President Biden called the airstrikes\nthat killed seven aid workers this week unacceptable and threatened to\ncondition future support for Israel on how it addresses concerns about\ncivilian casualties and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. It was the first time\nthat Biden explicitly sought to leverage American aid to influence Israel\u2019s\nconduct of the war against Hamas. But the White House stopped short of saying\ndirectly that the president would halt arms supplies or impose conditions on\ntheir use as some fellow Democrats have urged him to do.\n\nAnd a centrist group called No Labels has abandoned its plans to run a\npresidential ticket in this year\u2019s election after failing to recruit a\ncandidate. The group, which last year said it raised $60 million, had planned\nto put forward what it called a bipartisan unity ticket in the event of a\nrematch between President Biden and former President Trump but in recent\nmonths suffered a string of rejections from prominent Republicans and\nDemocrats who declined to run on its ticket.\n\nToday\u2019s episode was produced by Michael Simon Johnson, Eric Krupke, Luke\nVander Ploeg and Rachelle Bonja.
