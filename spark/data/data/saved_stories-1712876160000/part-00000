Photograph:\nFD/Francis Dias/Newspix International\n\nQueen's consent investigationsKing Charles III\n\n# Courtier demanded assurance king could not be prosecuted under new Welsh law\n\nPalace official secured assurance under archaic custom that requires UK\nparliaments to get monarch\u2019s consent for draft bills\n\nRob Evans, Severin Carrell and David Pegg\n\nShare\n\nRoyal courtiers privately put pressure on the Welsh government to ensure that\nKing Charles could not be prosecuted for rural crimes under a new law that\nministers had drawn up, documents reveal.\n\nThe elected politician in the Welsh government who is its chief legal adviser\nwas \u201cnot happy\u201d that the king was to be given the special exemption from\nprosecution but agreed to it last year.\n\nA Buckingham Palace official phoned the Welsh government to secure the\nassurance under an archaic custom that requires UK parliaments to obtain the\nconsent of the monarch for draft bills before they can be implemented.\n\nUnder the mechanism, ministers notify the royal family of specific clauses in\ndraft laws that may affect their personal wealth, their private property or\ntheir public functions. The ministers ask the monarch to approve the laws\nbefore they can be passed.\n\nInvestigations by the Guardian have shown that the late queen used her\nprivileged access to draft legislation to secure changes that protected her\nprivate interests or reflected her opinions. In one recent example, her\nlawyers lobbied Scottish ministers in 2021 to change a draft law to exempt her\nprivate land from a major initiative to cut carbon emissions.\n\nThe use of the consent mechanism has been criticised as \u201cundemocratic\u201d. It has\nbeen in force in Westminster since the 1700s and has been extended to the\nScottish and Welsh parliaments.\n\nDuring the queen\u2019s 70-year reign, she vetted more than 1,000 draft laws before\nthey were approved by elected politicians. Those included bills that affected\nthe her personal property such as her privately owned estates in Balmoral and\nSandringham.\n\nRevealed: Queen lobbied for change in law to hide her private wealth\n\nRead more\n\nThe mechanism has continued seamlessly into the reign of Charles. Ministers in\nWestminster, Scotland and Wales have been required to obtain his consent to 20\nlaws since he came to the throne in September 2022.\n\nBuckingham Palace refused to say whether the king had asked for any changes to\nthese laws before approving them. One was a bill that was formulated by the\nWelsh government to reform agricultural practices.\n\nOn 1 June last year, the Welsh government noted in an internal memo that its\nlawyers \u201chad been contacted by Buckingham Palace officials who have sought an\nassurance that Welsh ministers will take into account conventions regarding\nprosecuting the crown when making regulations under this bill\u201d.\n\nIn an email the following day, Welsh officials noted that Mick Antoniw, the\nWelsh government\u2019s counsel general \u2013 the equivalent of the attorney general in\nWestminster \u2013 was \u201cnot happy with the exclusion\u201d. However, he \u201crecognises the\nongoing convention and therefore\u201d agreed to it.\n\nThis was a reference to an ill-defined convention under which neither criminal\nnor civil proceedings can be brought against the monarch as head of state. The\nmonarch has been given personal immunity from swathes of British law, ranging\nfrom animal welfare to workers\u2019 rights.\n\nHowever, an investigation by the Guardian has previously highlighted the\nextent to which this practice gives the monarch immunity for his conduct as a\nprivate citizen, affording protection to the king\u2019s privately owned assets and\nestates.\n\nMore than 30 laws stipulate, for example, that police are barred from entering\nthe privately owned Balmoral and Sandringham estates without the king\u2019s\npermission to investigate possible crimes, including wildlife offences and\nenvironmental pollution. No other private landowner in the country is given\nsuch legal immunity.\n\nIn the case of last year\u2019s Agriculture (Wales) Act, the monarch was exempted\nfrom regulations relating to the marketing of agricultural products, the\ndisposal of carcasses and the disclosure of information to the Welsh state.\nPolice are also unable to gain automatic entry to the king\u2019s private property\nportfolio under that part of the act.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to First Edition\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s\nhappening and why it matters\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and\ncontent funded by outside parties.

The documents do not specify which of\nhis properties would be affected by this act.\n\nOther laws which have been screened by Charles under the consent mechanism\ninclude legislation relating to the rents that UK landowners can charge mobile\nphone companies for putting up masts on their land and the management of\nScottish private trusts. Trusts are widely used by the Windsors and can help\nthe rich to shield their assets from public scrutiny or tax.\n\nCharles gave his permission to a Scottish act that froze the rents for tenants\nin private properties and a Westminster act that required landlords to produce\nan electrical certificate in their rented homes. Charles rents out more than\n300 homes across his Balmoral and Sandringham estates.\n\nThe palace spokesperson said: \u201cKing\u2019s consent is a parliamentary process and\nHis Majesty has granted consent on each occasion it has been requested by\ngovernment.\u201d\n\nThis article was amended on 11 April 2024.
