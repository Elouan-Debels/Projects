So\nfar the team has primarily focused on making software that can be installed on\nexisting hardware. But earlier this year developer John Crispin announced that\nthe team was considering releasing the first official OpenWrt hardware.\n\nIt looks like that effort is moving forward, because now he\u2019s shared the first\npictures of a hardware prototype for the upcoming OpenWrt One router board.\n\nDesigned in partnership with Banana Pi, the board features a 1.3 GHz MediaTek\nMT7981B (Filogic 820) ARM Cortex-a53 dual-core processor, 1GB of DDR4 memory,\n128 MB of SPI NAND flash storage, 4MB of write-protected SPI NOR flash storage\n(for recovery), and an M.2 2242 socket for PCIe Gen 2 x1 solid state storage.\n\nNetworking features include two Ethernet ports: one with Gigabit speeds and\none with support for 2.5 GbE speeds, as well as s MediaTek MT7976C chip with\nsupport for WiFi 6.\n\nOther features include a USB 2.0 Type-A host port, a USB Type-C port (for\ndevice or console use), a mikroBUS expansion socket, and a real-time clock.\n\nThere are also physical reset and user buttons, a boot selection switch\n(allowing you to choose between the NAND or NOR storage, and support for a 12V\npower input (and optional support for a Power over Ethernet module).\n\nThe board measures 148 x 101mm (5.8\u2032\u2032 x 4\u2032\u2032) and it\u2019s expected to sell for\n$100 or less when it\u2019s finalized. But at this point only a small number of\nprototypes exist, with Crispin and others performing tests to ensure that\neverything works as expected. OpenWrt developers will also \u201cauction off one or\ntwo\u201d of the boards at the upcoming OpenWrt Summit in May.\n\nvia CNX Software\n\n## Support Liliputing\n\nLiliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links\n(if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on\nAmazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).\n\nBut there are several ways you can support the site directly even if you're\nusing an ad blocker* and hate online shopping.\n\n### Contribute to our Patreon campaign\n\nor...\n\n### Contribute via PayPal\n\n* If you are using an ad blocker like uBlock Origin and seeing a pop-up message at the bottom of the screen, we have a guide that may help you disable it.\n\n## Subscribe to Liliputing via Email\n\nJoin 9,542 other subscribers\n\nTagged: banana pi, open hardware, openwrt, openwrt one, router board\n\n## Join the Conversation\n\n3 Comments\n\nCancel reply\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

They\nsay the module for that is optional, but my experience would be considerably\nworse without it.\n\nReply\n\n  2.
