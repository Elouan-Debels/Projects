The vast\nmajority of those units are located in South Korea, followed by Hong Kong, the\nUS, Sweden, and Finland. The models are:\n\n  * LG43UM7000PLA running webOS 4.9.7 - 5.30.40\n  * OLED55CXPUA running webOS 5.5.0 - 04.50.51\n  * OLED48C1PUB running webOS 6.3.3-442 (kisscurl-kinglake) - 03.36.50\n  * OLED55A23LA running webOS 7.3.1-43 (mullet-mebin) - 03.33.85\n\nStarting Wednesday, updates are available through these devices\u2019 settings\nmenu.\n\n## Got root?\n\nAccording to Bitdefender\u2014the security firm that discovered the\nvulnerabilities\u2014malicious hackers can exploit them to gain root access to the\ndevices and inject commands that run at the OS level. The vulnerabilities,\nwhich affect internal services that allow users to control their sets using\ntheir phones, make it possible for attackers to bypass authentication measures\ndesigned to ensure only authorized devices can make use of the capabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese vulnerabilities let us gain root access on the TV after bypassing the\nauthorization mechanism,\u201d Bitdefender researchers wrote Tuesday. \u201cAlthough the\nvulnerable service is intended for LAN access only, Shodan, the search engine\nfor Internet-connected devices, identified over 91,000 devices that expose\nthis service to the Internet.\u201d\n\nThe key vulnerability making these threats possible resides in a service that\nallows TVs to be controlled using LG\u2019s ThinkQ smartphone app when it\u2019s\nconnected to the same local network. The service is designed to require the\nuser to enter a PIN code to prove authorization, but an error allows someone\nto skip this verification step and become a privileged user. This\nvulnerability is tracked as CVE-2023-6317.\n\nOnce attackers have gained this level of control, they can go on to exploit\nthree other vulnerabilities, specifically:\n\n  * CVE-2023-6318, which allows the attackers to elevate their access to root\n  * CVE-2023-6319, which allows for the injection of OS commands by manipulating a library for showing music lyrics\n  * CVE-2023-6320, which lets an attacker inject authenticated commands by manipulating the com.webos.service.connectionmanager/tv/setVlanStaticAddress application interface.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release\n\n#### reader comments\n\n15\n\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\nencryption, and passwords.
