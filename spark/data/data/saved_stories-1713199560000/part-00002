Both images were created by using the Event Horizon\nTelescope to observe the polarization of radio waves from the objects.\n(Courtesy: EHT Collaboration)\n\nThe magnetic field surrounding the supermassive black hole at the centre of\nthe Milky Way has been observed for the first time. Astronomers using the\nEvent Horizon Telescope (EHT) have been surprised by the orderly nature of the\nfield, which exists in the extremely violent environment surrounding the black\nhole Sagittarius A*. The study could lead to a better understanding of the\ncrucial role that the magnetic field plays in how the black hole feeds on\nsurrounding matter.\n\nThis is the second time that the EHT has observed the magnetic field of a\nsupermassive black hole. In 2021 it detected the field of the black hole at\nthe centre of the galaxy Messier 87 (M87).\n\nSupermassive black holes are believed to be surrounded by plasma that is\nswirling into the gravitational abyss. This creates a powerful magnetic field,\nwhich can then interact with the infalling material. This accelerating\nmaterial emits copious amounts of radiation including radio waves that are\npolarized by the local magnetic field.\n\n### Global network\n\nThe EHT is a global network of radio telescopes that can measure this\npolarization and therefore map-out the magnetic field surrounding a black\nhole.\n\nSagittarius A* weighs in at about 6.6 million solar masses \u2013 which is one\nthousand times less massive than the gargantuan M87. Despite this huge\ndifference, EHT astronomers were surprised by the similarity of the two\nobjects\u2019 magnetic fields.\n\n\u201cWe expected to find some signature of the magnetic field simply because we\nknow Sagittarius A* is still feeding, just very slowly,\u201d says Ziri Younsi of\nUniversity College London, who is a member of the EHT team. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t\nanticipate was that the pattern of the polarization would be so similar in\nmorphology to M87.\u201d\n\nAll supermassive black holes that accrete matter are expected to have a\nmagnetic field that is embedded in their accretion discs. The field is\nanchored in the plasma just outside the event horizon and is then amplified by\nthe rotation of the black hole. The M87 black hole is very active with a large\naccretion disc of plasma, compared to Sagittarius A*.\n\n### Controlling the flow\n\nThe magnetic fields of both objects have magnetic field lines in vortex-like\nconfigurations (see figure). The closer the lines are to each other, the\nstronger and more organized the magnetic field is. Younsi estimates that the\nmagnetic field strength of Sagittarius A* is on par with that of a\nrefrigerator magnet. While that might not sound like much, it is strong enough\nto affect the inflow of accreting plasma \u2013 thereby helping to control how the\nblack hole feeds.\n\nThe apparent similarity in the structures of the two magnetic fields has some\nastronomers wondering about other possible similarities.\n\nM87\u2019s black hole is notably for its relativistic jet. This is a tightly\ncollimated beam of particles that are swept up from the accretion disc by the\nmagnetic field and accelerated outwards to close to the speed of light. One\njet is visible along the object\u2019s axis of rotation and it is possible that\nanother extends in the opposite direction.\n\nGiven the similarity in magnetic structure, it is possible that Sagittarius A*\ncould also host relativistic jets that have thus far gone undetected.\n\n### Mysterious bubbles\n\nIndeed, such jets could be the source of the Milky Way\u2019s mysterious Fermi\nBubbles. These are two huge plumes of charged particles that rise 25,000\nlight\u2013years above and below the plane of the galaxy. Estimated to be just a\nfew million years old, they originate from the galactic centre, but their\ncause is uncertain.\n\nHowever, Younsi points out that a jet is highly collimated, whereas the Fermi\nBubbles span a wider area and are almost like an explosion. And while he\nconsiders the similarities between the two black holes as \u201ccurious\u201d, Younsi\ntells Physics World of his scepticism that our galaxy\u2019s black hole has a jet.\n\n\u201cOne could take some liberty and over-interpret this and say maybe it\u2019s\nevidence that there could be a jet,\u201d he says. \u201cOr it could be that we need to\nhave better data in the future at higher resolution and maybe we\u2019ll see that\nthe polarization pattern changes a little bit.\u201d\n\n### Rapid change\n\nM87 is 53 million light\u2013years away, and its black-hole accretion disc is huge,\nso those two factors mean we do not see it change very much over short time\nframes. Sagittarius A* is much closer to us at a distance of about 26,000\nlight\u2013years, and its far smaller accretion disc means that the EHT can see the\naccretion disc changing over the course of minutes and hours.\n\nThe first image of Sagittarius A* (brightness, not polarization), released in\n2022, was therefore, a time-averaged view of the black hole, and Younsi points\nout that it could just be a coincidence that the time-averaged image of the\nmagnetic field looks similar to M87, meaning searches for jets could be\nfutile.\n\n\u201cSagittarius A* is changing very rapidly, so there is a lot more uncertainty\nin the structure seen in the image,\u201d says Younsi. \u201cWe need some long-term\nmonitoring, because what we\u2019re looking at right now could just be a fluke that\nhappens to look like M87 and actually it\u2019s not representative of the general\ntime-averaged state. It could be that this image changes a lot in the next few\nyears.\u201d\n\nWeather permitting, the EHT observes Sagittarius A* every year, most recently\nthis April. It is also continuing to keep tabs on M87\u2019s black hole and is\ntrying to detect supermassive black holes in other galaxies. The more black\nholes are observed, the more we will know whether Sagittarius A* and M87\u2019s\nblack hole really are typical examples.\n\nThe observations are described in two papers in the The Astrophysical Journal\nLetters. One paper covers the polarization measurements and the other\ndescribes their implications.\n\nKeith Cooper is a science writer based in the UK\n\n### Physics World Jobs\n\nTake the next step in your career and find your perfect job\n\nRead previous\n\n  * Quantum mechanics\n  * Research update\n\n#### Giant quantum tornado behaves like a black hole in miniature\n\nRead next\n\n  * Diagnostic imaging\n  * Research update\n\n#### Spectral and phase-contrast CT combine strengths to enhance X-ray imaging\n\n## Discover more from Physics World\n\n    * Astronomy and space\n    * News\n\n### US astronomers slam cuts to the Chandra X-ray observatory\n\n    * Quantum mechanics\n    * Research update\n\n### Giant quantum tornado behaves like a black hole in miniature\n\n    * Stars and solar physics\n    * Blog\n\n### Dispatches from the Great North American eclipse of 2024\n\n## Related jobs\n\n  * T\u00fcbingen | Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of T\u00fcbingen\n\n#### Experimental Astrophysics positions at IAAT\n\n  * Greenbelt | National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\n#### Cosmic-ray Instrument Scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center\n\n  * San Francisco | Heising-Simons Foundation\n\n#### Science Program Officer, Heising-Simons Foundation\n\n## Related events\n\n  * Astronomy and space | Conference SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation 2024 16\u201421 June 2024 | Yokohama, Japan\n  * Particle and nuclear | Symposium Fifth International Symposium on the Casimir Effect 15\u201421 September 2024 | Piran, Slovenia\n  * Astronomy and space | Conference Seventh International Conference on the Nature and Ontology of Spacetime 16\u201419 September 2024 | Albena, Bulgaria\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by IOP Publishing Ltd and individual contributors\n\n#### Explore Physics World\n\n  * About us\n  * Our team\n  * Our portfolio\n  * Advertising\n  * Contact us\n  * Feedback\n  * Sign in\n  * Register\n\n#### MORE INFORMATION\n\n  * Institute of Physics\n  * Join the Institute\n  * Modern Slavery Act\n  * Privacy and Cookies\n  * IOP Publishing\n  * Copyright\n  * Terms and Conditions\n  * Disclaimer\n\n#### OUR MISSION\n\nPhysics World represents a key part of IOP Publishing's mission to communicate\nworld-class research and innovation to the widest possible audience.
