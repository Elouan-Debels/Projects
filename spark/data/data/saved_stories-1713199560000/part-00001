Right: The\npromulgation of the Berufsbeamtengesetz law allowing the dismissal of \u201cnon-\nAryan\u201d civil servants from their positions\n\nPrior to the 1930s, Germany had dominated the natural sciences for more than\none hundred and fifty years. Its reputation for excellence in chemistry,\nphysics, biology, medicine and mathematics was rivaled, if at all, only by\nBritan (Medawar & Pyke, 2000). Of the 100 Nobel Prizes awarded between the\nyears of 1901 and 1932 (the year before Hitler came to power), 33 had been\nawarded to Germans and/or scientists working in Germany. For comparison, Brits\nand scientists in British universities had won 18 and the United States a mere\nsix.\n\nThen, starting in 1933 with the Nazi party\u2019s seizure of control in Germany and\ntheir passing of the Berufsbeamtengesetz (\u201cLaw for the Restoration of the\nProfesssional Civil Service\u201d), certain groups of public employees were\ndimissed from German universities. That is, civil servants who did not fit the\nNazi racial or societal ideal had to leave their jobs in the name of \u201cre-\nestablishing a national and professional civil service\u201d. In addition to\nbureaucrats, teachers, judges and other workers, scientists and academics were\nalmost immediately affected, including at the world-leading institutions of\nthe University of G\u00f6ttingen and Humboldt University of Berlin (Heims, 1980 p.\n165). By the middle of April, the Main Office for Press and Propaganda of the\nGerman Student Union proclaimed a nationwide \u201caction against the un-German\nspirit\u201d. Not long after, public Nazi marches on and around university campuses\nwere taking place and \u201cb\u00fccherverbrennung\u201d (book-burning ceremonies) were held\nin protest of literature found to be sympathetic with socio-democratic, left-\nleaning and/or \u201cJewish values\u201d. In a series of letters to a colleague in\nAmerica, John von Neumann (1903-57) (who had emigrated to the U.S. in 1930)\nwrote (R\u00e9dei, 2005):\n\n> \u201cThe news from Germany are bad: heaven knows what the summer term 1933 will\n> look like.\u201d\n\nThe term, indeed the coming years, became what has been later called a \u201cgreat\npurge\u201d of world-renowned scientists from Germany, the likes of which the world\nhad never seen. The effect? The rise of the United States as the world\u2019s\ncenter of scientifist research and the \u201cdeath\u201d of the University of G\u00f6ttingen\nas a top tier research university (see essay below).\n\n#### The Mathematical Center of the Universe\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Veisdal\n\n\u00b7\n\nAugust 8, 2021\n\nRead full story\n\n##\n\nBackground\n\nNazi leader Adolf Hitler bows to President of Germany Paul von Hindenburg on\nMarch 21st, 1933\n\nOn January 30th 1933, the President of Germany Paul von Hindenburg reluctantly\nappointed Nazi party leader Adolf Hitler to be the Chancellor of Germany.\nAfter two months in office, following the burning of the Reichstag building,\nthe German parliament passed what has later been called the \u201cEnabling Act\u201d\ngiving Hitler full legislative power for a period of four years. Following the\ndeath of von Hindenburg the year after, Hitler exploited the act to merge the\noffices of Chancellor and President, creating the new office of \u201cF\u00fchrer and\nReichskanzler\u201d. von Neumann, then in Budapest, wrote the following of these\nevents in a letter to his colleague Veblen in Princeton in April of 1933:\n\n> Excerpt, letter from von Neumann to Veblen (April 3rd 1933)\n>\n> It seems, that this Summer will be a endless series of sensations - and not\n> always of the agreeable kind. [...] Please excuse in me that I am asking\n> such a lot of questions. But you know, how these things interest me, and how\n> little newspapers a[re] worth, if you want to find out anything.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> The news from Germany are bad: heaven knows what the summer term 1933 will\n> look like. The next programm-number of Hitler will probably be annihilation\n> of the conservative-monarchistic-party [...] I did not hear anything about\n> changes or expulsions in Berlin, but it seems that the \"purification\" of\n> universities has only reached till now Frankfurt, G\u00f6ttingen, Marburg, Jena,\n> Halle, Kiel, K\u00f6ningsberg- and the other 20 will certainly follow. [...] It\n> is really a shame, that something like that could happen in the 20th\n> century.\n\n##\n\nThe Purge\n\nMore than 250 Jewish professors and employees were fired from the University\nof Berlin in 1933\u201334 and numerous doctorates were withdrawn. In May, some\n20,000 books written by \u201cdegenerates\u201d and opponents of the Nazi regime were\nremoved from the university library and burned in the Babelplatz . Reportedly,\nNazi minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels gave a speech for the occasion,\nproclaiming the death of \u201cJewish intellectualism\u201d (Isaacson, 2007).\n\nAmong the most prominent Jewish scholars forced to emigrate was, as von\nNeumann writes in his letter to Veblen, mathematician Richard Courant\n(1888\u20131972), one of G\u00f6ttingen\u2019s three institute heads. He left Germany for\nCambridge in 1933, as he was dismissed from his position, not for being Jewish\n(exempted a veteran of the First World War), but due to his membership in the\nsocial-democratic political left (Schappacher, 1991). A former student of\nDavid Hilbert (1862-1943), Courant first accepted a position in Cambridge, but\ngrew homesick within a year and returned to Germany, only to realize that\nthere was no way for him to stay permanently. He thus re-emigrated, this time\nto New York University where he would remain for the rest of his life,\nbuilding up a large and flourishing mathematics department (Medawar & Pyke,\n2000) there. Other students of Hilbert at G\u00f6ttingen, including Felix Bernstein\n(1878\u20131956) and Edmund Landau (1877\u20131938) were also forced out, as was\nHilbert\u2019s student Hermann Weyl (1885\u20131955), three years after being appointed\nhis successor. Initially having been offered von Neumann\u2019s position at the\nInstitute for Advanced Study, Weyl changed his mind as the political situation\nin Germany grew worse (Weyl was a Christian, but his wife Helene was Jewish),\nand joined the IAS in September of 1933 (see essay below).\n\n#### The Birth of the Institute for Advanced Study (1930)\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Veisdal\n\n\u00b7\n\nAugust 26, 2022\n\nRead full story\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879\u20131955) who openly opposed the Nazi regime, happened to be\nvisiting the United States when Hitler came to power. A visiting professor at\nthe California Institute of Technology on and off starting in December 1930,\nEinstein and his wife Elsa last left Germany for in December 1932, prior to\nHitler\u2019s ascension (see essay below). Despite holding a chair as Professor of\nPhysics at the University of Berlin, he feared for the safety of both himself\nand his family. That year, a German magazine printed a list of \u201cenemies of the\nGerman regime\u201d with an accompanying picture of Einstein marked \u201cnot yet\nhanged\u201d with a $5,000 bounty (Jerome & Taylor, 2006).\n\n#### Einstein's Emigration to America (1932)\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Veisdal\n\n\u00b7\n\nJanuary 6, 2022\n\nRead full story\n\nWhen they closed up their summer house in Caputh in 1932, Einstein reportedly\nturned to his wife Elsa and said \u201cDreh dich um. Du siehst\u2019s nie wieder\u201d (Pais,\n1982).\n\n> \u201cTurn around. You will never see it again\u201d\n\nEinstein would go on to spend a period of time in the UK, before settling for\ngood at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton alongside von Neumann\nand Weyl as one of the IAS\u2019 six founding faculty members. Albeit from afar, he\nwould play an instrumental role in the rescue operations that would take place\nthroughout the 1930s. Writing to Professor Max Born (1882-1970) in G\u00f6ttingen\nat the end of May, his mixed emotions of enthusiasm and desperation for the\nmission afoot are apparent:\n\n> Letter from Einstein to Born (30th of May, 1933)\n>\n> Dear Born. Ehrenfest sent me your letter. I am glad that you have resigned\n> your positions (you and Franck). Thank God there is no risk involved for\n> either of you. But my heart aches at the thought of the young ones.\n> Lindemann has gone to G\u00f6ttingen and Berlin (for one week). Maybe you could\n> write to him here about Teller. I heard that the establishment of a good\n> Institute of Physics in Palestine (Jerusalem) is at present being\n> considered.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> Two years ago I tried to appeal to Rockefeller's conscience about the absurd\n> method of allocating grants, unfortunately without success. Bohr has now\n> gone to see him, in an attempt to persuade him to take some action on behalf\n> of the exiled German scientists. It is to be hoped that he'll achieve\n> something. Lindemann has considered London and Heitler for Oxford. He has\n> set up an organization of his own for this purpose, taking in all the\n> English universities. I am firmly convinced that all those who have made a\n> name already will be taken care of. But the others, the young ones, will not\n> have the chance to develop.\n\nThe \u201cLindemann\u201d Einstein mentions in the letter is Frederic Lindemann\n(1886\u20131957), the most influential scientific advisor to the then-\u201dMP in\nopposition for Woodford\u201d Winston Churchill. Despite his German name, Lindemann\nwas English and a physicist by training, and so got along with both Churchill,\nEinstein and their colleagues in government and academia, respectively.\nLooking to appeal to both his sense of humanity and military strategy,\nEinstein went to Churchill in the summer of 1933 asking for help in bringing\nJewish scientists out of Germany (see essay below).\n\n#### When Einstein met Churchill (1933)\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Veisdal\n\n\u00b7\n\nNovember 5, 2021\n\nRead full story\n\nOf the meeting \u2014 which was held at Chartwell \u2014 characteristic of both men\u2019s\nreputations for eccentricity, someone later wrote:\n\n> \u201cChurchill wore a large Stetson hat and Einstein a white linen suit that\n> looked like he had slept in it\u201d\n\nKnown for his decisiveness, Churchill responded immediately by sending his\nfriend Lindemann to Germany on a rescue mission to seek out and recruit Jewish\nscientists and offer them placements in British universities (Gilbert, 2007).\nLindemann\u2019s first visit was to physicist Max Born.\n\nJames Franck and Max Born together in 1929 outside the Institute of Physics at\nG\u00f6ttingen\n\nBorn was one of six Jewish professors who in the spring of 1933 had been\nsuspended from their positions in G\u00f6ttingen as a result of the enactment of\nthe Berufsbeamtengesetz. A future Nobel Prize winner, at the time he was among\nthe world\u2019s 3\u20134 foremost authorities on quantum physics, having supervised the\nlikes of Pascual Jordan (1902-80), J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904-67), Enrico\nFermi (1901-54) and collaborated with Heisenberg, Pauli and Bohr. In his 1971\nbook The Born-Einstein Letters*, Born recounted his own version of the events\nthat had ensued:\n\n> \u201cOne day (at the end of April 1933) I found my name in the paper amongst a\n> list of those who were considered unsuitable to be civil servants, according\n> to the new \"laws\". After I had been given 'leave of absence', we decided to\n> leave Germany at once. We had rented an apartment for the summer vacation in\n> Wolkenstein in the Gr\u00f6dner valley, from a farmer by the name of Peratoner.\n> He was willing to take us in immediately. Thus, we left for the South Tyrol\n> at the beginning of May (1993); we took our twelve-year old son, Gustav,\n> with us, but left our adolescent daughters behind at their German schools.\u201d\n>\n> \\- Excerpt, The Born-Einstein Letters* by Max Born (1971)\n\nOn his way to Tyrol, on May 10th Born witnessed the book burnings first-hand\nand despite his typical quiet and calm demeanor reacted so furiously that his\nwife Heidi had to restrain him from intervening (Medawar & Pyke, 2000).\nShortly after arriving at their destination, Lindemann visited, attempting to\nentice Born to accept a position at Oxford University. Having spent time in\nCambridge in the 20s, Born instead chose to accept a position as a \u201cresearch\nstudent\u201d at St. John\u2019s College, Cambridge. Later, in 1936, he accepted a\nposition as the Tait professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of\nEdinburgh, where he remained until 1952 before retiring to G\u00f6ttingen.\n\nFrom left to right: Max Reich (1874\u20131941) , Max Born, James Franck and the\n\u201cFather of Solid State Physics\u201d Robert Pohl (1884\u20131976) from a 1923 ceremony\nin honor of Franck. Photo: Wikimedia Commons\n\nAs Einstein\u2019s letter to Born recounts, Lindemann also considered recruiting\nBorn\u2019s former students Walter Heitler (1904\u20131981) and Fritz London\n(1900\u20131954). Heitler was a German physicist who made contributions to quantum\nelectrodynamics and quantum field theory and had worked for a time as\nassistant to Schr\u00f6dinger. Following his habilitation in 1929 under Born, he\nremained at the University of G\u00f6ttingen as a privatdozent until 1933, when he\nwas let go. Safely in the UK, Born later arranged for him to get a position as\na research fellow at the University of Bristol, working under Nevill F. Mott.\nLondon, also a physicist, similarly lost his position at the University of\nBerlin following the enactment of the Berufsbeamtengesetz. A collaborator of\nHeitler, London had helped redefine chemical bonds in the age of quantum\ntheory. Following his dismissal, he took visiting positions in England and\nFrance before, like many others, emigrating to the United States just before\nthe war, in 1939.\n\n#### The Golden Age of Quantum Physics (1927)\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Veisdal\n\n\u00b7\n\nSeptember 3, 2021\n\nRead full story\n\nThe other professor Einstein mentions, James Franck (1882\u20131964), was a German\nphysicist and the 1925 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics (joint with his\nfrequent collaborator Gustav Hertz) for \u201ctheir discovery of the laws governing\nthe impact of an electron upon an atom\u201d. At the time of the purge in the\nspring of 1933, Franck was the head of experimental physics at the University\nof G\u00f6ttingen, a position he had held for over thirteen years. A full\nprofessor, he was also the Director of the Second Institute for Experimental\nPhysics in G\u00f6ttingen. Alongside Born, Franck had built G\u00f6ttingen\u2019s physics\ndepartment into one of the world\u2019s finest (Rice & Jortner, 2010). Although\nexempt from the Berufsbeamtengesetz law as a veteran of the First World War,\nas Einstein recounts to Born, Franck nonetheless submitted his resignation at\nG\u00f6ttingen, the first academic known to have resigned his position in protest\nof the law. After a brief visit to the United States, he later took up a\nposition at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, before returning to the\nU.S. in 1938, accepting a job offer at the University of Chicago.\n\nPhysicist Hans Bethe (1906\u20132005) was dismissed from his job at the University\nof T\u00fcbingen in Germany on account of being Jewish and so left for England\nafter receiving an offer for the position of lecturer at the University of\nManchester through his doctoral advisor Arnold Sommerfeld (1868-1951) and his\nassociate William Lawrence Bragg (1890-1971) there (Bernstein, 1980). Bethe\njoined the faculty of Cornell University in 1935 and contributed to the\nManhattan Project as head of the theoretical division at Los Alamos. A nuclear\nphysicist, through the course of his career he also made important\ncontributions to astrophysics, quantum electrodynamics and solid state\nphysics, winning the Nobel Prize in physics in 1967 for his work on the theory\nof stellar nucleosynthesis.\n\n###\n\nThe Martians of Budapest\n\nLeft to right: Edward Teller, Eugene Wigner and Leo Szil\u00e1rd, who all left\nGermany in the early 1930s due to the rise of Nazism\n\nEinstein\u2019s letter to Born also mentions the then-aspiring young Edward Teller\n(1907-2003), one of four prominent Hungarian physicists who, due to their\nJewish origin and Hungarian universities\u2019 openly antisemitic policies at the\ntime, were compelled to leave Europe for America in the 1930s. Interestingly\nand consequentially, all four contributed significantly to the development of\nthe first atomic bomb, alongside Franck, Bethe and others (see essay below).\n\n#### The Martians of Budapest\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Veisdal\n\n\u00b7\n\nOctober 2, 2021\n\nRead full story\n\nTeller, a student of Born who would later be known colloquially as the \u201cFather\nof the hydrogen bomb\u201d had been in Copenhagen studying with Niels Bohr\n(1885-1962) until just before Hitler fame to power. He was in G\u00f6ttingen in the\nspring of 1933. From there he immediately left for England with the help of\nthe International Rescue Committee, a global humanitarian aid founded in 1933\nat the encouragement of Einstein. In England, Teller was welcomed at the\nUniversity College of London, before being offered a full professorship at\nGeorge Washington University in D.C., which he accepted in 1935. His friend\nand later Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner (1902\u20131995) had at been at Princeton\nUniversity since 1930. Before that, he too had been at the University of\nG\u00f6ttingen working both as an assistant to Hilbert and alongside Weyl on group\ntheory and its applications in quantum physics. Reportedly, when he was first\nrecruited for a one-year lectureship at Princeton, his salary increased seven-\nfold from what it had been in Europe (Szanton, 1992). However, following the\nexpiration of his term in 1936, Princeton chose not to renew his position and\nso Wigner had to move to the University of Wisconsin. There he stayed for two\nyears before returning to Princeton in 1938 to commence work on the Manhattan\nProject.\n\nLeo Szilard (1898\u20131964) who is best known as the discoverer of the nuclear\nchain reaction, similarly as Teller left Germany for England in 1933 (see\nessay below). Reportedly, he transferred his savings of \u00a31,595 (about\n\u00a3100,000) from Zurich to London and was able to live in hotels without work\nfor the first year. He eventually took up work as a physicist in St.\nBartholomew\u2019s Hospital, working on radioactive isotopes for medical purposes.\nHe travelled to U.S. as a visiting researcher in 1938\u201339, eventually settling\nat Columbia University. There, in collaboration with Walter Zinn (1906-2000),\nhe took up the task of experimentally verifying the news (brought to America\nby Bohr in January 1939) that Otto Hahn (1879-1968) and Fritz Strassmann\n(1902-80) in Germany had observed barium in the residue after bombarding\nuranium with neutrons, demonstrating the previously unknown phenomenon of\nnuclear fission. Szilard and Zinn\u2019s initial test that the fission of uranium\nproduced more neutrons than it consumed helped Szilard later convince Fermi\nand Herbert L. Anderson (1914-88) to conduct large-scale fission experiments\non uranium to verify the possibility of a sustainable nuclear chain reaction.\n\n#### The Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd Letter (1939)\n\nJ\u00f8rgen Veisdal\n\n\u00b7\n\nJune 7, 2021\n\nRead full story\n\nAlthough himself Italian and Roman Catholic by origin, Fermi was (like his\nGerman colleagues) forced to escape Mussolini\u2019s fascist Italy in 1938 because\nhis wife Laura was Jewish. The creator of the world\u2019s first nuclear reactor,\nFermi won the 1938 Nobel Prize in physics for his work on induced\nradioactivity. Before the war, he had spent a semester studying under Born at\nthe University of G\u00f6ttingen. There, in the middle of the 1920s he first met\nthe \u201cfather of quantum mechanics\u201d Werner Heisenberg (1901-76) and his\ncollaborator Wolfgang Pauli (1900-58). After this and several other research\nvisits, Fermi eventually settled at the Sapienza University of Rome after\nobtaining a full professorship there in 1926. A Nobel laureate, upon his\nemigration to America in 1939, Fermi was offered positions at five different\nuniversities, eventually settling on an offer from Columbia , where he had\ngiven summer lectures in 1936. There, he conducted the first nuclear fission\nexperiment in the United States and with the help and encouragement of\nSzil\u00e1rd, the first large-scale fission experiment using 200 kilograms of\nuranium oxide.\n\nJohn von Neumann, alongside Wigner, was first recruited from Europe by Veblen\nto Princeton University in 1930. Him and Wigner had by that point collaborated\non five papers and before that, attended the same Lutheran high school in\nBudapest in the 1910s. According to Wigner, they were invited to Princeton\ntogether on a recommendation from the university that they find and invite:\n\n> \"..not a single person but at least two, who already knew each other, who\n> wouldn't suddenly feel put on an island where they had no intimate contact\n> with anybody. Johnny's name was of course well known by that time the world\n> over, so they decided to invite Johnny von Neumann. They looked: who wrote\n> articles with John von Neumann? They found: Mr. Wigner. So they sent a\n> telegram to me also.\"\n>\n> \u2014 Excerpt, John von Neumann* by Norman Macrae (1992)\n\nvon Neumann\u2019s considerable research output taken into account, despite being\n30 years old, he was offered a lifetime professorship at the newly-founded\nInstitute for Advanced Study alongside Einstein and Weyl in 1933. He would\nlater be instrumental in helping Kurt G\u00f6del (1906-78) escape occupied Austria.\nAlthough not Jewish, G\u00f6del\u2019s association with the Vienna Circle and his\ndoctoral advisor Hans Hahn (1879\u20131934) had made him a target. In a letter to\nthe founder of the IAS Abraham Flexner (1866\u20131959), von Neumann in September\n1939 pleaded (R\u00e9dei, 2005):\n\n> \"The claim may be made with perfect justification that G\u00f6del is\n> unreplaceable for our education program. Indeed G\u00f6del is absolutely\n> irreplaceable; he is the only mathematician alive about whom I would dare to\n> make this statement [...] I am convinced that salvaging him from the wreck\n> of Europe is one of the great single contributions anyone could make to\n> science at this moment.\"\n\nG\u00f6del was be offered a position at the IAS, which he assumed in 1940.\n\n##\n\nThose Who Remained\n\nEinstein\u2019s friend Max Planck (1858\u20131947) was 74 years old when the Nazis came\nto power. Although his friends and colleagues fled, himself, a Lutheran, tried\nto \u201cpersevere and continue working\u201d, hoping the crisis would abate and the\npolitical situation improve. Later founder and President of the Max Planck\nSociety Otto Hahn (1879\u20131968), despite supposed Jewish ancestry (Riehl &\nSeitz, 1996), too remained in Germany during the rise of the Nazis,\ndiscovering nuclear fission in 1938 and being awarded the Nobel Prize in\nChemistry in 1944. An opponent of national socialism, Einstein later wrote of\nHahn that\n\n> \u201cHahn was one of the very few who stood upright and did the best he could in\n> these years of evil\u201d \u2014 Albert Einstein\n\nIndeed, the only known case of a German scientist refusing on moral grounds to\nsucceed an expelled Jewish colleague was Otto Krayer (1899\u20131982), who in\nresponse to a job offering at the University of D\u00fcsseldorf wrote the following\nin protest of the purge of his colleagues (Medawar & Pyke, 2000):\n\n> I prefer to forgo this appointment, though it is suited to my inclination\n> and capabilities, rather than having to betray my convictions, or that by\n> remaining silent I would encourage an opinion about me that does not\n> correspond with the facts.\n>\n> \u2014 Otto Krayer, Assistant Professor of Pharmacology in Berlin\n\nIn response, Krayer was dismissed from his post at the University of Berlin\nfor refusing to accept the appointment. Wolfgang Haubner later reported about\na meeting with Krayer in his diary on July 4th 1935, writing:\n\n> \u201cOn the way I spoke with Krayer who justified his refusal to return to\n> Germany with the impossibility of taking the Hitler oath\u201d.\n\nTwo years later, in 1937, Krayer was appointed as an Associate Professor at\nHarvard University. He lead Harvard\u2019s Department of Pharmacology from 1939 to\n1966, being awarded numerous academic honors.
