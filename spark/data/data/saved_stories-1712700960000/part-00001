These bicycles, usually equipped with pedals and an electric motor assist, are popular with consumers and commuters and are becoming part of local business delivery systems. The trend could significantly reduce particulate pollution and smog, as well as cut carbon emissions in the transportation sector.\n  * But there are barriers. No international manufacturing standard yet exists for e-bikes. Also, transportation and charging infrastructure doesn\u2019t adequately accommodate e-bikes, especially in the developing world where electric bicycles have the potential to replace super-polluting gas-powered scooters, motorcycles and pedicabs.\n  * Poorly made or improperly maintained e-bike batteries have developed a reputation for sometimes causing fires, exploding and even killing people, which has caused hesitation among consumers. While this safety problem is a real one, manufacturers and enthusiasts say the e-bike industry can effectively deal with it.\n  * Some governments are offering subsidies and tax incentives to e-bike buyers, while some companies are offering deals allowing customers to trade in gas two-wheelers for e-bikes. As sales and use grow, updated bike lane construction and safety rules setting permissible e-bike horsepower, speed and size will be required.\n\nCan simply adding an electric motor to a human-powered bicycle significantly\nreduce urban smog, traffic congestion and energy consumption \u2014 and even help\ncurb climate change? Yes, but many bumps in the road must be overcome to get\nthere.\n\nToday\u2019s electric bicycles come in a range of two-wheeled e-bikes and three-\nwheeled e-trikes, varieties to meet consumer and business needs, with many\nmillions already sold. The addition of an electric motor to the traditional\nbicycle\u2019s powertrain has not only expanded its range and usefulness for\nrecreation and commuting, but propelled it into commerce, largely for making\nlast-mile deliveries or as taxis.\n\nAmong the e-bike\u2019s advantages: Riders, combining pedal power with an electric\nassist, can climb steep hills, travel faster and farther. Electric bikes also\nallow the elderly or people with some medical limitations to ride.\n\nBut before e-bikes reach their full societal potential, the industry and the\nworld\u2019s nations need to overcome some impediments, including manufacturing\ncapacity, battery reliability and safety, transportation infrastructure and\nculture.\n\nToday\u2019s electric bicycles come in a range of two-wheeled e-bikes and three-\nwheeled e-trikes, and varieties to meet consumer and business needs, with many\nmillions already sold.

Growth\nhappened everywhere, but the \u201cAsia Pacific [region] dominated the global\nmarket, with China accounting for most of the e-bike market share,\u201d noted the\nresearch firm.\n\nAs of 2020, an estimated 130 million e-bikes were on the road in China alone.\n\u201cFactors such as extensive bicycle infrastructure in developed and developing\ncountries; including China, India and Japan; high vehicular and public transit\ncongestion; and increasing stringency of emission regulations for gasoline\nmotorcycles are attributed to the dominance of the [Asian] market,\u201d Fortune\nBusiness Insights wrote.\n\nFortune also forecast robust future growth in Europe. Major manufacturers are\nnow building e-bikes in the U.S., Taiwan, Japan, the Netherlands, India and\nGermany. Elsewhere, the Middle-Eastern and African e-bike market was valued at\n$805 million in 2021 and is projected to grow to $1.2 billion by 2027.\nWorldwide e-bike sales are expected to soar to 60 million units annually by\n2025 \u2014 a trend that will rocket the industry from niche market to mainstream\nmode of mobility.\n\nAs of 2020, an estimated 130 million e-bikes were on the road in China alone.\nImage by V.T. Polywoda via Flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0).\n\n### Good for commerce and the environment\n\nWhile electric cargo bikes are already capable of replacing delivery trucks\nand cars in many situations, a number of factors inhibit their use, including\ncost, safety concerns, lack of infrastructure and limits to how far you can go\non a charge, noted a 2023 study published in Transportation Research\nInterdisciplinary Perspectives.\n\nThe report found that cargo bike owners reduce auto trips by 1-4 per week by\nusing e-bikes. Other studies cited by the report noted that while e-bikes can\ndefinitely cut greenhouse gas emissions, it\u2019s not clear by how much. On the\ndownside, they will increase demand on electrical grids.\n\nBike Adviser, a U.S. website dedicated to cycling, estimates that if\n\u201cAmericans replaced only 8% of their short-distance car trips [of 5 miles or\nless] with e-bikes, we would save 44K metric tons of CO2 every day, which is\nequivalent to the carbon sequestered by 724,496 tree seedlings grown for 10\nyears.\u201d One caveat: If electric bikes are to reach their full potential as\ncarbon emission reducers, electrical grids will need to be powered by\nalternative sources, not fossil fuels.\n\nA study by New York University (NYU) suggested increased e-bike infrastructure\ncould lower carbon emissions in the New York metro area by as much as 30% and\nespecially help in low-income areas, considering just deliveries, let alone\nother uses. But there are barriers to increased use. \u201cMore distribution\ncenters are needed to fulfill the growing needs of e-commerce activities. ...\nA more complete bike lane network is needed to accommodate the future\nexpansion of cargo bike operation, and more effort is required to improve the\nbike accessibility of distribution centers,\u201d the NYU study concluded.\n\nThe use of cargo bikes for \u201clast-mile\u201d deliveries could reduce traffic and\npollution, the Urban Mobility project of the European Institute of Innovation\n& Technology reported in November 2023. Cargo bikes are easier to park and can\ngo where larger vehicles can\u2019t, which compensates for speeds slower than\nautos. \u201cThis result points towards an important finding concerning fossil-fuel\ndriven transport vehicles, namely the likelihood that current business\npractices promote a high degree of inefficiency and significant levels of\nunnecessary emissions, noise and other risks caused by the use of faster,\nlarger vehicles in urban environments,\u201d according to the report, which\nexamined transport systems in Stockholm, Sweden, and Barcelona, Spain.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a given that replacing gas-powered cars and trucks with e-bikes\nwill help clean up air pollution that seriously harms public health (including\ntailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulfur\noxides and volatile organic compounds), it\u2019s not clear how much, as the issue\nhasn\u2019t been studied sufficiently.\n\nE-bikes could be especially valuable for curbing urban air pollution in\ndeveloping nations, outcompeting and replacing dirty, smog-producing two-cycle\nengines that run on a mix of gasoline and oil and which today power millions\nof super-polluting scooters, motorcycles and pedicabs. Today\u2019s gas \u201cscooter\nspews out between tens and thousands of times more fine particles and toxic\ngases, proportionate to the amount of fuel consumed, than even heavy [gas-\npowered] trucks and buses,\u201d noted a study published in the journal Nature\nCommunications.\n\nElectric cargo bikes can be used for commercial deliveries, carrying loads too\nheavy for a manual bike, or even to transport your pet.

Manufacturers want to make and sell\ne-bikes worldwide. But there\u2019s a catch: No international agency has yet\nstepped up to create global standards to classify e-bikes based on horsepower,\nspeed, size, etc.\n\nThose manufacturing standards will be needed to sell e-bikes internationally,\ncautioned Ash Lovell, the electric bicycle policy & campaign director for\nPeopleForBikes, an American bicycle industry advocacy group. European makers\nare working on doing just that, she added.\n\nUntil this happens, there\u2019s also the problem of a large number of poorly\nconstructed, unsafe e-bikes getting sold. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge rise in [e-bike\nuse] over the last 10 years and what we\u2019ve seen accompanying this rise is a\nproliferation of different types of products, both very economical or not very\nwell made, or high-quality products inaccessible ... because of their price,\u201d\nLovell noted.\n\nNext roadblock: the need to design and build infrastructure and write rules\nfor the road to serve an e-bike influx. Many factors must be considered,\nincluding driving regulations, traffic routes, charging infrastructure,\nredesigning bike lanes and loading bays to accommodate cargo e-bikes, defining\nexactly who gets to use those bike lanes and setting up hubs where trucks can\ndrop off cargo for last-mile e-bike delivery.\n\nGovernments have yet to recognize e-bikes as unique vehicle types that require\nspecial consideration when planning travel lanes, charging stations and\nparking. A study in China found that \u201curban planners ... need more time [to\nmeet] the challenge of the dramatically fast bicycle electrification process.\nFor example, although electrified bicycles have significant higher speed (up\nto 25\u201340 kph or 15.5-25 mph) than conventional bicycles (less than 15 kph or\n9.3 mph), they are [currently] all classified as bicycles by the Chinese\ngovernment.\u201d Those higher speeds make e-bike injuries more severe when\ninvolved in a crash, the study noted.\n\nWhile bike lanes have been sprouting up on roads in wealthier nations for\nyears now, they\u2019ve generally been designed for traditional bicycles. E-bikes\n(or e-trikes) capable of faster speeds or pulling trailers or carrying wide\nloads make passing and navigating turns within standard bike lanes a problem.\n\nE-bike riders likewise have a harder time going up and down sidewalk curbs,\nespecially when they\u2019re not cut, reported a paper from the Urban Cycling\nInstitute of Amsterdam, released last fall. Cargo bike users also found it\nmore unwieldy to activate light switches on sidewalks, the institute wrote.\n\nTransportation planners will have to catch up soon because the market is\ngrowing everywhere. The German Bicycle Industry Association estimated that\nnext year, half of all bicycles sold in Germany will include a motor \u2014 people\nbought nearly 2 million e-bikes there in 2021.\n\nCellphones keep riders in touch but can become a distraction and safety hazard\nif used while riding.

Several types of\nrechargeable batteries power e-bikes, the most common being lithium-ion,\naccounting for 68% of the market. Lithium batteries are more efficient, less\nexpensive and take up less space and weight than alternatives such as lead-\nacid, the second-most common type, which is easier to recycle; and nickel-\nmetal hydride batteries.\n\nBut lithium-ion batteries are currently prone to catching fire and have caused\nexplosions and even killed people. To assure consumer safety, the world\u2019s\ncountries will need to develop regulatory safeguards.\n\nIn the U.S., the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is developing\nmandatory battery safety standards. \u201cIt will take some time,\u201d CPSC press\nsecretary Patty Davis said. Meanwhile, CPSC told manufacturers to comply with\nvoluntary codes UL 2849 in the U.S. and EN 15194 in Europe.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is there\u2019s not a lot of compliance,\u201d Davis added. \u201cWe\u2019re\nstill seeing fires.\u201d CPSC has recalled lithium-ion batteries at least 10 times\nin the last four years, she said. \u201cUntil [standards] are mandatory, there will\nbe shoddy products out there that put consumers at risk.\u201d\n\nIn March, CPSC opened a public comment period on an \u201cadvance notice of\nproposed rulemaking\u201d for e-bike safety, not including battery hazards. CPSC is\nseparately working on a project to \u201cenhance the safety of high-energy\nbatteries in consumer products, especially for micromobility products,\u201d\naccording to the agency\u2019s FY 2024 Operating Plan.\n\nRad Power Bikes, the largest e-bike maker in North America, told CPSC, \u201cPoorly\nmanufactured e-bike batteries and related electrical components, which\ngenerally use lithium-ion batteries, can cause unique fire-safety challenges\n... not covered by the existing bicycle standard.\u201d The International\nAssociation of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) wrote the agency that the \u201cnation\u2019s fire and\nemergency service is responding to multiple incidents per day involving\nconsumer-based products (e-bikes, scooters, wheelchairs, etc.) and their\nbatteries in thermal runaway.\u201d\n\nIAFC concluded, \u201cIncreased community education is needed to better explain the\nrisks of both using the wrong battery for a piece of equipment, and the wrong\ncharger for a specific battery. ... The next step would be to create a method\nfor the community to safely dispose of damaged batteries and compromised\ndevices. Another key aspect the IAFC is concerned about is the [safety of the]\ncharging infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAn ongoing effort to make e-bikes safer and more energy efficient involves\ncreating a self-charging battery that stores energy used when pedaled. The\nSolar Bicycle Project has developed a solar powered battery, but it is\npresently large and bulky and only offers enough power in sunny climates.\nSolar power could reduce the need to install recharging stops. The EU in 2023\nput into force a law to ensure batteries are sustainable, safe and circular\n(codifying the use of less harmful materials in battery making, and assuring\nthe collection, reuse and recycling of spent batteries).\n\nThe motor of an e-bike that\u2019s fit right on the frame.

Most of these incentives involve rebates, but some use vouchers to\nsubsidize purchases, or tax credits. Some programs are capped while others\nemploy income limits or phasedowns.\n\nColorado, for instance, currently offers a point-of-sale rebate of $500-1,100.\nThis spring, it is initiating a $450 tax credit. Maine is starting a grant\nprogram to help low- and moderate-income residents buy e-bikes \u201cto offset\ntransportation that would otherwise be provided by fossil fuel vehicles.\u201d\nSanta Barbara, California, is loaning e-bikes so people can try them. In San\nFrancisco, you can trade in your car for an e-bike and get some cash back\n(within income limits).\n\nTax credits don\u2019t help as much as rebates or vouchers, Lovell said, because\n\u201cto wait to get a rebate until [buyers] file their taxes won\u2019t work for people\nwho are cash-strapped.\u201d\n\nMany subsidy programs are just getting started, so it\u2019s too early to judge\ntheir effectiveness. But an evaluation of a financial assistance program for\npublic employees in New Zealand found the \u201cscheme was broadly successful,\u201d\nwith 39% of employees saying they probably wouldn\u2019t have bought an e-bike\nwithout the subsidy.\n\nIn Africa, startup company Spiro, is looking to eliminate fossil fuel-guzzling\nmotor bikes and scooters via its innovative trade-in program, which exchanges\ngas powered bikes for e-bikes. Spiro, founded in 2022, has already offered\ntrade-ins putting 10,000 e-bikes on the road in Benin, Toga and Rwanda and has\na roll-out plan for 140,000 e-bikes in Uganda, and more than a million in\nKenya. Traded gas-powered bikes are either scrapped or converted to e-bikes.\nSpiro is also helping deal with Africa\u2019s lack of charging infrastructure and\nplans to install 3,000 stations in Kenya alone.\n\nLast year, the United Nations Development Programme hosted a national workshop\nto promote the design and adoption of an electric vehicle-sharing model in\nVietnam.\n\nA further indication that electric bikes are trending is the world\u2019s first\nelectric scooter championship \u2014 a global Formula E electric race series\noriginated by Lucas di Grassi in partnership with the UN Environment\nProgramme. Sure, sustainability and carbon cuts are desirable, but the thrill\nof racing e-bikes at speeds topping 60 mph is bound to attract buyers too.\n\nDespite all the roadblocks, the future looks bright for electric bikes.\n\nBanner image: Some governments are offering subsidies and tax incentives to\ne-bike buyers.
