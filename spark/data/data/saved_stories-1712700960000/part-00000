$200 million in gold bars monthly, Wells Fargo\nestimates\n\nPublished Tue, Apr 9 202411:17 AM EDTUpdated 35 Min Ago\n\nJeff Cox@jeff.cox.7528@JeffCoxCNBCcom\n\nWATCH LIVE\n\nIn this article\n\n  * COST+2.33 (+0.33%)\n\nCostco selling 1 ounce gold bars\n\nCourtesy: Costco\n\nGold has turned into money for Costco, where yellow metal sales begun last\nyear have turned into a cash cow for the big-box retailer.\n\nIn fact, sales are so brisk that analysts at Wells Fargo expect revenue \u201cmay\nnow be running at\u201d $100 million to $200 million a month, a rapid acceleration\nsince bullion hit the warehouse club late in the summer of 2023.\n\n\u201cOur work suggests there has been significant interest given COST\u2019s aggressive\npricing and high level of customer trust,\u201d Edward Kelly, an equity analyst at\nthe bank, said in a note to clients Tuesday. \u201cThe accelerating frequency of\nReddit posts, quick on-line sell-outs of product, and COST\u2019s robust monthly\neComm sales suggests a sharp uptick in momentum since the launch.\u201d\n\nIf Kelly\u2019s assessment is correct, that would represent quite a move for a\nproduct that only debuted last August and generated about $100 million in\nsales in Costco\u2019s fiscal first quarter that ended in late November 2023.\n\nCostco is selling 1-ounce bars made of nearly pure 24-karat gold. While the\nprice is not disclosed online to nonmembers, it\u2019s estimated that the product\ngenerally sells for about 2% above the spot price, which as of Tuesday morning\nwas around $2,357 an ounce. That would put the price at Costco just more than\n$2,400.\n\nGold has been on a tear this year, with spot prices rising more than 13% in\n2024, pushed higher by a persistent bout of inflation that started in 2022 and\ninvestor fear over the state of the deteriorating U.S. fiscal situation. The\ngovernment is on pace for a $2 trillion deficit this year, adding to a total\ndebt load that has surpassed $34.6 trillion.\n\nGold / US Dollar Spot\n\nXAU=:Exchange\n\n2,344.35+5.4591 (+0.23%)\n\nLast | 12:58 PM EDT\n\nGold surge\n\nSo, selling gold bars has been easy for a store priding itself on its variety\nof consumer choices.\n\nThere are a few catches: Sales are limited to five per customer (up from two\npreviously) and while the benefits to Costco\u2019s top line are clear, it\u2019s a\nlittle different story for bottom-line profit. That\u2019s because in addition to\nthe low premium the store gets for gold bars, it further offers 2% cash back\nfor executive members and another 2% for those who use their Citigroup credit\ncards. The sales are adding about 3% to general merchandise sales but not\ncontributing much to profit, Kelly said.\n\n\u201cPricing at that level and shipping costs suggests it\u2019s a very low profit\nbusiness at best,\u201d the analyst wrote.\n\nAs an investment, though, it makes a lot of sense in these times. While gold\nis seen as a natural inflation hedge, there are other factors at play,\nincluding geopolitical unrest in the Middle East and Eastern Europe that has\ncreated uncertainty about financial stability.\n\nCentral banks have been large buyers of gold, especially in Asia, and the run-\nup in prices this year suggests that while purchases are down in the early\npart of 2024, they are likely to pick up later, according to DataTrek\nResearch.\n\n\u201cThe move suggests that many foreign governments feel the need to hedge\ngeopolitical outcomes that might be negative catalysts for other risk assets\nlike stocks,\u201d DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said in a recent market note.\n\u201cThe only good news is that this reinforces the idea of gold as a reasonable\nhedge for diversified portfolios.\u201d\n\nCostco officials did not immediate return a request for comment.\n\n## Don\u2019t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\n\n  * Crypto investors are bracing for a busy quarter with the Bitcoin halving, ether ETF updates and potential rate cuts\n  * Gold could start to overtake bitcoin as the cryptocurrency stalls at $70,000, says Wolfe Research\n  * Investors are focused \u2018overwhelmingly\u2019 on bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies, BlackRock says\n\nTV\n\nFast Money Halftime ReportWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APP\n\nUP NEXT | The Exchange 01:00 pm ETListen\n\n  * Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n  * Subscribe to Investing Club\n  * Licensing & Reprints\n  * CNBC Councils\n  * Supply Chain Values\n  * CNBC on Peacock\n  * Join the CNBC Panel\n  * Digital Products\n  * News Releases\n  * Closed Captioning\n  * Corrections\n  * About CNBC\n  * Internships\n  * Site Map\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Careers\n  * Help\n  * Contact\n\n  * #### News Tips\n\nGot a confidential news tip?
