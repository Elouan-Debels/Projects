I have read A Quarter Century\nof Unix by Peter Salus; he is reasonably accurate about the history that I\nknow personally (I sent him a few corrections). I am going to stick to my\nfirst-hand knowledge in this note.\n\nWhen Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL) joined with MIT MIT Project MAC and\nGeneral Electric's computer department in 1964 to create the Multics project,\nBTL contributed some of the finest programmers in the world to the team. I\nfirst met Ken Thompson because he had written a slick editor for CTSS called\nQED. It was descended from QED on the SDS-940, but was quite different because\nKen had added regular expressions to it, and made many other changes. (Ken had\npublished a paper on compiling regular expressions into machine code just\nbefore joining the Multics project.) Ken worked on the Multics I/O switch\ndesign. Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday were BCPL jocks. Joe Ossanna worked on\nthe I/O system design and wrote one of the original six Multics papers; Bob\nMorris, Doug McIlroy, Dolores Leagus, Dave Farber, and Jim Gimpel worked on\nEPL, Stu Feldman worked on the I/O switch, Peter Neumann managed the team and\nworked on file system design, Brian Kernighan worked on the support tools.\n\nSummary of a session of an unidentified conference in 1968 or 1969, apparently\na panel discussion in which Joe Ossanna described the status of Multics.\n(Thanks to Jerry Saltzer.)\n\nThe late Prof. Mike Mahoney of Princeton interviewed several Bell Labs Multics\nparticipants; their interviews are available in the Charles Babbage Institute\ncollection. One of these is \"Unix: an Oral History\" by Gordon M. Brown. In\nthis article, he describes the BTL impatience with Multics progress in\n1967-69:\n\nSam Morgan, director of Computing Science Research at Bell Labs during this\nperiod, expressed his own concerns that Multics research was going very slowly\nand wasting effort, saying: \"It was becoming clear to people that Multics was\nan attempt to climb too many trees at once. The development was moving more\nslowly than had been expected and users were sighing with varying degrees of\npungency.\"\n\nConsequently, Bell Labs pulled out of the project in March of 1969, leaving GE\nand MIT to salvage what they could of the system. According to Berk Tague, it\nwas [VP for Research] Bill Baker who made the decision to pull the plug,\nsaying \"Like Vietnam, he [Bill Baker] declared victory and got out of\nMultics.\" McIlroy echoed these thoughts, mentioning that Bell Labs \"had a\nmillion dollars worth of equipment in the attic that was sitting there being\nplayed with by three people. It became clear that we were a drag on the\ncomputer center's budget.\" This sudden loss of the Multics system was to have\nimportant consequences on the direction of computing at Bell Labs and on the\ncreation of Unix.\n\nAlthough Bell Labs had dropped out of the Multics project in April 1969, those\nof us in Cambridge kept in touch with individual folks at BTL, and so we knew\nthat Ken and Dennis were working on a project of their own. We even knew that\nit had a joke name, Unix, coined by Brian Kernighan, that was a reference to\nMultics. (\"One of whatever Multics was many of\" or \"Multics without balls.\")\n\nRudd Canaday wrote interesting blog entries describing his contributions to\nUnix, especially the file system.\n\nThere had been a highly regarded ACM SIGOPS sponsored conference on operating\nsystems at Gatlinburg, Tennessee in 1967. The foruth of these conferences was\nheld in Yorktown Heights, NY in 1973, and Ken and Dennis gave a talk there,\npresenting Unix. Several of us Multicians went to the conference, and sat with\nthe Bell Labs ex-Multicians, and applauded the paper, which was and remains\none of the best and clearest pieces of writing in the computer field. There\nwere some other great papers at that conference, but as I remember, the Unix\npaper won the best paper award.\n\nI was working for MIT in those days, and one thing I did was to organize an\nMIT PDP-11 users' group and encourage them to look into Unix. The idea of a\nfree, non-vendor-supported operating system was new to them. I invited Dennis\nRitchie to come up and talk to them.\n\nWe went to lunch afterward, and I remarked to Dennis that easily half the code\nI was writing in Multics was error recovery code. He said, \"We left all that\nstuff out. If there's an error, we have this routine called panic(), and when\nit is called, the machine crashes, and you holler down the hall, 'Hey, reboot\nit.'\"\n\nIn 1978, Honeywell chose me to give a speech at a conference in Paris,\ncelebrating the 20th anniversary of INRIA. My talk was titled \"An Example of\nIndustry-University Cooperation: Multics.\" The conference was in the Paris\nUNESCO building, attended by lots of French scientists. There were little\nearphones for simultaneous translation at every seat. John Shoch from Xerox\nPARC spoke before me, and talked about some of the neat things they were doing\nat Xerox with Unix systems.\n\nAfter I gave my speech, there were questions from the audience. Someone asked\na question in French, which was translated to me as, roughly, \"You say that\nMultics has only 25 sites. There are already 1500 Unix sites. How does that\nmake you feel?\"\n\nI said, \"I feel proud. It was a privilege to work with Ken Thompson and Dennis\nRitchie on Multics, and I am glad to see Unix having the success it deserves.\"\nI said more, about the difference in goals of the systems, and about how much\neasier it was to do things the second time.\n\nAfterward the local Multicians told me my questioner was one of an anti-\nMultics faction in Bull. It occurs to me now that he was probably more likely\npro-Unix than anti-Multics, but in those days there was a lot of fear and\nwith-us-or-against-us thinking, and Multics was fighting for its life as\nusual. I don't think my answer satisfied either faction.\n\nWhen I finally got a chance to use Unix in 1987, on an Apollo workstation at\nTandem, I felt instantly at home. The ls command, control arguments, shell\nscripts... lots of things felt so similar to Multics that I could go right to\nwork, consulting man pages occasionally to find out what the Unix name of\nsomething was.\n\nThere were technical borrowings in both directions. (This was before look-and-\nfeel lawsuits and similar foolishness.) Unix has many features that Multics\nand CTSS had first, and many are obvious translations of Multics features.\n\nUnix| Multics  \n---|---  \nls| list (ls)  \ncp| copy (cp)  \npwd| print_wdir (pwd)  \ncd| change_wdir (cwd)  \nmail| mail  \nif| if  \nlogin| login (l)  \nlogout| logout  \nwho| who  \nman| help  \n  \nThe first time I remember the name \"shell\" for the function of finding and\nrunning a command was in a Multics Design Notebook document by Louis Pouzin of\nMIT Comp Center. See The SHELL: A Global Tool for Calling and Chaining\nProcedures in the System and RUNCOM: A Macro-Procedure Processor for the 636\nSystem in the Multics design notebook. (Louis had written a predecessor\nprogram called RUNCOM for CTSS. The Multics equivalent is exec_com.) These\nmemos conained the idea of having the command processing shell be an\nunprivileged user program that parsed a command line, located a program to\nrun, and executed it with arguments. Later documents in the Multics System\nProgrammer's Manual by Doug Eastwood of BTL described the proposed shell.\nThere, commands that return a value into the command line were called\n\"evaluated commands\". Later, evaluated commands were renamed \"active\nfunctions,\" the name used in Calvin Mooers' TRAC language.\n\nThe Unix roff, troff, and nroff commands are direct descendants of Jerry\nSaltzer's CTSS RUNOFF command, used for Multics documentation. Bob Morris and\nDoug McIlroy ported that program from MAD to BCPL and then got the BCPL runoff\nup on Multics when the IBM 7094 was going away; that code was the ancestor of\nthe machine language roff that Ken and Dennis wrote for the fledgling Unix.\n\nThere was some influence in the other direction in the 70s and 80s. For\nexample, Multics \"master directories\" work very much like Unix mount points.\n\nFor more information, see\n\n  * Dennis Ritchie's \"The evolution of the UNIX time-sharing system,\" Bell System Technical Journal 63, 8, Oct 1984.\n  * The IEEE Computer interview with Ken Thompson.\n  * In their own words: Unix pioneers remember the good times NetworkWorld article by J D Sartain (2013)\n\n## Update: Unix at 50\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the creation of Unix has led to multiple articles. One\nis Richard Jensen's \"Unix at 50: How the OS that powered smartphones started\nfrom failure\". (His article is based in part on interviews that the late Prof.\nMike Mahoney conducted with Unix creators before he died in 2008.)\n\nSuch articles often say \"Multics failed; the Bell Labs computer guys then\ninvented their own system, Unix, and Unix succeeded.\" That's tidy, but not the\nwhole story.\n\nIn March 1969, Bill Baker pulled the plug on Bell Labs participation in the\nMultics project, not on Multics. Multics development continued, vastly\nimproved the operating system, and led to the sale of a lot of high-end\nsystems until Bull terminated development 16 years later.\n\nMultics didn't fail: it accomplished almost all of its stated goals. Unix\nsucceeded too, solving a different problem.\n\n03/21/93, updated 01/25/95, 02/05/95, 01/23/15, 04/29/16, 12/07/16, 12/13/16,\n09/03/19\n\nNext story\n\n", "frontpage": true}
