Fifty years on, how\nhave attitudes changed?\n\nMadeleine Thien\n\nShare\n\nIn an out-of-the-way room in the grounds of the Shanghai Conservatory of\nMusic, I came across a memorial: photographs, papers and objects in memory of\nthe 20 people \u2013 professors, spouses and students \u2013 who lost their lives during\nthe 10-year Chinese Cultural Revolution. This catastrophe officially ended in\n1976, the year of Mao Zedong\u2019s death. When, a short time later, violinist\nIsaac Stern arrived for a series of high-profile concerts, he found that\nShanghai \u2013 home for nearly a century to one of the first orchestras in Asia \u2013\ncould not find him one playable piano. The instruments, including an estimated\n500 owned by the Shanghai Conservatory, had been destroyed.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution: all you need to know about China's political\nconvulsion\n\nRead more\n\nMusic \u2013 the ways people listen, the things they are prevented from hearing and\nthe compositional forms \u2013 holds up an unusual mirror to China and its future:\ntoday it is the largest consumer and maker of pianos, producing a staggering\n80% of the world\u2019s supply.\n\nThe story of western classical music\u2019s trajectory in China summons a vast\ncanvas, featuring priests, revolutionaries, heroes and emperors. When the\nJesuit missionary Matteo Ricci journeyed to the Forbidden City in 1601 bearing\na clavichord for the emperor, the Imperial Court dispatched four eunuchs, one\nof whom was 72 years old, for keyboard lessons. The quartet paid their\nrespects to the instrument, beseeching the clavichord to be patient with them\n\u201cif they were slow to learn this art, hitherto unknown to them\u201d. More than a\ncentury later, the Qianlong emperor maintained an ensemble of 18 European-\ntrained court musicians, and a multivolume encyclopedia of western music\ntheory commissioned by his grandfather.\n\nThe grandeur of the Qing court was not to last. By the mid-19th century, the\ncountry, devastated by the opium wars, was in free fall. Missionaries were\ngiven unprecedented \u2013 and to the Chinese, humiliating \u2013 access to the\ninterior. Impoverished families relied on the charity of Christian schools\nwhere, untethered from the traditional curriculum, their children studied the\nlives of European composers, learned hymns and played the piano, violin and\nclarinet.\n\nThe hunger for reform became unstoppable, and the ensuing \u201cnew culture\u201d\nmovement brought together artists and intellectuals who called for a sea\nchange in the way China imagined selfhood and nationhood. Western music,\nunhindered by the need for translation, flowered in its wake. Intellectuals,\nin the words of prominent scholar Wu Zhihui, needed to \u201cflush all classical\nChinese literature down the toilet\u201d.\n\nThe piano radiated western modernity \u2013 a factory-produced instrument\nconsisting of more than 200 engineered carbon steel wires \u2013 and was used by a\nprosperous middle class in the service of culture and self-expression. But\npiano music posed a musical question: what happens to us when we listen to\nsomething new? Because western classical music \u2013 its tuning, compositional\nforms and history \u2013 was a completely different language.\n\n> One of the first smear campaigns targeted the music of Debussy, considered\n> the dirt left behind by western imperialism\n\nFor centuries, the essential qualities of Chinese music hinged on the rising,\nfalling, winding and turning of sound and non-sound elements. Non-sound,\naccording to linguist and musicologist Adrian Tien, includes silence,\ninterruptions and rests, as well as the ebb of sounds as they fall towards\nnothingness. Non-sound was as integral to music as the white space in a work\nof calligraphy. Tien observes that it was \u201cexpected of even the introductory\nbeholder to hear beyond the sonic form\u201d. Listening was not primarily about the\near: it required a freeing of the mind so that other non-sensory stimuli could\nbe perceived.\n\nRomantic music brought a different auditory experience. With its lavish\norchestras and stirring motives of exposition, development and recapitulation\n\u2013 of transformation \u2013 it seemed capable of expressing the potentiality of\nmodern Chinese selves. As Sheila Melvin and Jindong Cai movingly chronicle in\nBeethoven in China, the composer was the guiding spirit for young men and\nwomen, driven by a love of their country, who were determined to \u201cseize fate\nby the throat\u201d and build a China of social equality and dignity.\n\nThe violence unleashed by the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1966 was\nmore about Mao than about culture. But culture, and its ability to redraw the\nself, was the scapegoat. Mao\u2019s words would be used against countless\nindividuals: \u201cAll literature and art belong to definite classes and are geared\nto definite political lines. There is in fact no such thing as art for art\u2019s\nsake.\u201d\n\nOne of the first ideological smear campaigns targeted the music of Debussy,\nconsidered \u201cthe dirt left behind\u201d by western imperialism, and singled out He\nLuting, president of the Shanghai Conservatory, for defending the French\ncomposer\u2019s music. He Luting\u2019s stubborn refusal, in the face of mental and\nphysical torture, to confess to spiritual and political crimes was an act of\nunimaginable heroic resistance. In his history of 20th-century music The Rest\nIs Noise, Alex Ross observes: \u201cNo musician ever made a braver stand against\ntotalitarianism.\u201d\n\nConductor of the Shanghai Symphony Lu Hongen was also arrested. Days before\nhis execution, he told his cell mate: \u201cVisit Austria, the home of music. Go to\nBeethoven\u2019s tomb and lay a bouquet of flowers. And tell Beethoven that his\ndisciple is in China.\u201d\n\nA Chairman Mao Zedong poster from the Cultural Revolution.

A piece of music has many\nmeanings, political or otherwise \u2013 there is no one, absolute interpretation.\nThe many suicides at the Shanghai Conservatory reflected profound despair and\nperhaps an inability, or a refusal, to accept the Cultural Revolution\u2019s world\nof absolutes, a world that even today presents a serious threat to artists,\nlawyers and human rights campaigners.\n\nWhen it comes to ways of listening, the Chinese have long been open to other\ncultures and to change \u2013 not in a revolutionary way, but through a process\nthat builds on its long musical tradition. Indeed, China\u2019s two most emblematic\nand beloved traditional instruments, the pipa and the erhu, originated\nelsewhere, in the Middle East and on the steppes of Central Asia respectively.\n\nA century ago, the heroic possibilities of Romanticism shaped a generation of\nChinese thinkers. What music will win the country\u2019s attention next? My vote is\nfor JS Bach, who, in China, is still overshadowed by Beethoven. The pianist\nZhu Xiao-Mei, after living through the Cultural Revolution, wrote that the\nstaggering polyphony of Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations \u201chad all one needed to\nlive\u201d. Her conclusion, that in Bach as in everything \u201cthere is no single\ntruth\u201d, echoed that of Canadian pianist Glenn Gould, who marvelled at the way\n\u201ceach individual voice leads a life of his own\u201d.\n\nThe act of creation was, for Bach, acts of counterpoint: each voice stands\nalone yet sounds in combination with another; there is solitude and contact;\nand mysteriously, no voice is subsumed by another.\n\nDo Not Say We Have Nothing by Madeleine Thien is published by Granta.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Classical music\n  * features\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Comments (...)\n\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * Books\n  * Music\n  * TV & radio\n  * Art & design\n  * Film\n  * Games\n  * Classical\n  * Stage\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
