Similes, analogies, metaphors, and euphemisms\nare Baker\u2019s uncontested territory. Few areas of knowledge have evaded his\nencyclopedic curiosity, which means he can compare a piece of machinery to\nanother piece of machinery, or a piece of machinery to a sex organ, or a sex\norgan to a New Yorker staff writer, and it\u2019s usually persuasive. Get a load of\nthe breathtaking density of objects crammed into this single sentence about a\nvacuum cleaner: \u201cTo restore the machine to full suction, you had to dig around\nin the curved whisps of dog and cat fur that collected in a tub, like cotton\ncandy in a floss bowl, and twist to release a central perforated tube, then\npry out a sandwich-sized filter and thumb it manually, as if you were\nstrumming a zither.\u201d Or the scene in his 2016 memoir about working as a\nsubstitute teacher in Maine public schools, in which Baker and some fifth\ngraders \u201cwalked to the cafeteria, where there was a massive molten fondue of\nnoise.\u201d The narrator of his first novel, The Mezzanine, appreciates old-school\nturn-signal levers that \u201cmove in their sockets like chicken drumsticks.\u201d \u201cI\ncan and do wear socks all day,\u201d Baker writes in 2003\u2019s Box of Matches, \u201cthat\nhave a monstrous rear-tear through which the entire heel projects like a\ndinner roll.\u201d \u201cFormerly dull-seeming tidbits of history,\u201d collected in a\nrecent book, \u201cglowed like cherry tomatoes in the picnic salad of the twentieth\ncentury.\u201d\n\nThis kind of thing can make a person positively hungry. (Baker\u2019s descriptions\nof literal food are just as good: at a publishing party, he describes being\n\u201cforced to eat sliced and stuffed things at traypoint.\u201d) More broadly, the\neffect is an expansive, energizing sense of de- and re-familiarization, a\npsychedelic recognition that the built environment is linked to itself in all\nkinds of mysterious and pleasing ways. One begins, in heavy-duty Baker-reading\nperiods, to look around and feel that the entire physical world\u2014its glimmering\nmatrix of information technologies and engineering triumphs, plastics and\nsnacks\u2014is up for associative grabs.\n\nFinding a Likeness, the title of Baker\u2019s new memoir, is suggestive of his\ncareer-spanning analogical concern. What\u2019s Baker been doing all this time, if\nnot finding tender, outr\u00e9 likenesses everywhere he looks? Now he has tried out\na different kind of looking: Finding a Likeness chronicles two years in which\nBaker took a break from fiction and literary journalism to teach himself \u201chow\nto draw and paint on the far side of sixty,\u201d recasting his interest in\nfigurative language as a new focus on figurative art. The mechanics of getting\n\u201csomewhat better at art\u201d\u2014the mimetic skill that drawing demands, the\n\u201cerasefully slow\u201d temporality imposed by shading a landscape or still life,\nthe robust universe of instruments and tools (longtime Bakerian subjects)\navailable to the amateur artist\u2014echo many of his lifelong literary concerns.\nBut the essential irony of the book\u2014one Baker is way too humble to name\u2014is\nthat we spend much of it watching one of the best describers alive struggle\nwith the basics of representation.\n\nLong before he turned to visual art, Baker was writing images. (There\u2019s a\ngenerally synesthetic quality to much of his prose\u2014blurbs on the back cover of\nmy copy of Vox compare the novel to both Chagall\u2019s drawings and Ravel\u2019s\nBolero\u2014but the dominant mode, the sensory system to which he defaults, is the\nvisual.) Baker\u2019s exhilarating similes belong to a larger project of capturing\nhow everyday things look in ultra-high-resolution detail; his sensibility, he\nadmits in the early memoir U and I, is \u201cimage-hoarding.\u201d Also in that book, in\nwhich Baker reflects on his literary indebtedness to John Updike, he refers to\nUpdike\u2019s image-forward style as \u201cProusto-Nabokovian,\u201d one of many admiring\nepithets in the memoir that could equally apply to Baker himself. (I just\ndon\u2019t believe Baker, who in his previous book had described a woman\u2019s pregnant\nbelly as \u201cBernoullian,\u201d and her pubic hair as \u201cbrief,\u201d when he claims to envy\nUpdike\u2019s \u201cadjectival resourcefulness.\u201d) Nabokov\u2019s crisp molecular comedy, his\ntendency toward anthimeria and dryly upcycled technical language, his clich\u00e9-\ndemolishing descriptive precision; Proust\u2019s luxuriant digressiveness, his\ngreat subject of time, and above all his sublime animation of psychological\nriffs by visual cues: already, by 1991, it was clear that these were Baker\u2019s\ngifts too.\n\nThe two novels that preceded U and I\u20141988\u2019s The Mezzanine and 1990\u2019s Room\nTemperature\u2014had established Baker\u2019s imagistic method. Both novels take place\nover the span of less than an hour. Each records the thoughts of an\nappealingly intelligent first-person narrator as he attends to a routine task:\nworkday lunch break; feeding infant daughter. These narrators bubble with what\nThe Mezzanine\u2019s Howie calls \u201cmechanical enthusiasms,\u201d and their inner\nmonologues slip into warm and jazzy studies of twentieth-century manufactured\nobjects: staplers, dustpans, milk cartons, HVAC systems, stamps. Baker\u2019s\nassociative, detail-rich descriptions of this stuff can resemble an especially\nexuberant species of product photography, entries in history\u2019s most charming\nindustrial supply catalogue. \u201cAnything, no matter how rough, rusted, dirty, or\notherwise discredited it was, looked good if you set it down on a stretch of\nwhite cloth, or any kind of clean background,\u201d Howie muses. \u201cAnytime you set\nsome detail of the world off that way, it was able to take on its true stature\nas an object of attention.\u201d What flowed from this philosophy\u2014which Finding a\nLikeness, in its own way, returns to\u2014was an experiment in the near-total\nsubordination of storytelling to image: in cheerfully materialist white-collar\nfiction that really sees the means of production.\n\n  * Self-portrait by Nicholson Baker.\n\n  * Self-portrait by Nicholson Baker.\n\nWHO WAS DOING ALL THAT EXTRAORDINARY SEEING? Baker\u2019s early narrators were\naffable, horny, ecstatically attentive noticers, almost always men, who have\nin common a Pnin-like delight in the physical infrastructure of modernity.\n(Nabokov: \u201cElectric devices enchanted him. Plastics swept him off his feet. He\nhad a deep admiration for the zipper.\u201d) The comedy lay in the scalar\ndiscrepancy between their all-seeing knowledge of \u201cthe way the world works,\u201d\nas the title of a 2012 collection of Baker\u2019s essays has it, and the\nuneventful, zoomed-in, low-stakes subjects they gamely applied it to, like if\nDeLillo wrote an episode of Seinfeld.\n\nOne does occasionally get the sense that these guys\u2019 mechanical enthusiasms\nmay flourish at the expense of other kinds of understanding. They\u2019re curiously\nunaffiliated: typically they have jobs\u2014solid \u201990s jobs like word processor\u2014but\nlittle sense of institutional belonging; they might have wives or girlfriends\nbut conspicuously few friends. (\u201cFriends, don\u2019t have any\u201d appears in The\nMezzanine in a catalogue of Howie\u2019s thoughts\u2014sorted by frequency\u2014below\n\u201cPanasonic three-wheeled vacuum cleaner, greatness of.\u201d) When they encounter\nother people who aren\u2019t babies or John Updike, it is often via some mediated\nor object-oriented process: Howie surfaces from his mesmerizing private\nreveries only to speak to cashiers and secretaries behind desks and machines;\nthe narrator of 1994\u2019s The Fermata (a terrific and under-theorized novel that\nallegorizes the temporal powers of fiction as even Proust couldn\u2019t do) has the\nsupernatural ability to pause time, and spends most of the book freeze-framing\nthe human world so that he can do dirty things to women. One novel, Vox, takes\nplace entirely over the phone.\n\nIn his middle novels, Baker\u2019s preoccupation with objects and images\u2014with\nmaking them knowable and, unique among his TV-and-tchotchke-obsessed\ncontemporaries, with making them likable\u2014began to accommodate an expanding\ninterest in character. Vox, the first book in Baker\u2019s loose erotic trilogy,\ncontains some of the old emphasis on solitude and mediation; one character\nadmits that an evening spent with a coworker, watching porn on VHS, was\n\u201cprobably the best sexual experience I\u2019ve had, or at least one of the elite\nfew.\u201d But the novel, occasioned by a chance encounter via sex hotline, also\nregisters real connection between strange minds casting about and alighting\nnot just on objects and how they look but on people and how they feel.\n\n> \u201cSometimes I think with the telephone that if I concentrate enough I could\n> pour myself into it and I\u2019d be turned into a mist and I would rematerialize\n> in the room of the person I\u2019m talking to. Is that too odd for you?\u201d\n\n> \u201cNo, I think that sometimes,\u201d he said.\n\nSomething has shifted here: a newly outward-facing orientation, a wider\naperture of attention. Rereading these surprising and funny mid-career novels,\nI remembered one of the many tossed-off kernels of publishing sociology in U\nand I. Auditing his own tendency toward \u201clouped scrutiny\u201d in contrast to\nUpdike\u2019s mature works, Baker wrote that \u201cthe metaphorical sense, along with\nthe flea-grooming visual acuity that mainly animates it, fades in importance\nover most writing careers, replaced, with luck, by a finer social\nattunedness.\u201d\n\nFlea-grooming! He really had his own number. But social attunedness did arrive\nin Baker\u2019s later work, which became larger in scope and less buoyed by pure\nenchantment as the mellow \u201990s came to a close. Seinfeld ended. Underworld\ncame out. It became clear that emergent digital systems threatened to destroy\nall kinds of library collections, newspaper archives, film-storage methods\u2014the\nvery best of the twentieth-century world of things\u2014and Baker wrote a series of\nbooks and reported pieces about analog media preservation and the people\nattempting it. The United States invaded Iraq, and Baker, possibly the most\nfamous pacifist in contemporary American letters, adjusted his lens again. His\nfiction and nonfiction has, since the beginning of the war on terror, circled\nthe subject of American war crimes, from a controversial work of history about\nthe unjust aims and methods of the Allied powers during World War II to the\n2004 novel Checkpoint, which follows two guys chatting about assassinating\nGeorge W. Bush. (Bakerian pacificism and uneventfulness triumph in the end:\nthe guys don\u2019t go through with it.) In 2020, Baker published Baseless, a diary\nof his only partially successful attempt, using the Freedom of Information\nAct, to learn about the United States\u2019 likely use of illegal biological\nweapons during the Cold War.\n\nThese are heavier, lower-key books, anchored by a tone of powerless\ndisappointment in a country that, in addition to producing all kinds of\ninteresting machinery and realist fiction, also kills civilians with impunity.\nThe subject is now undeniably people (the individual perpetrators of war, and\ntheir victims); the scope increasingly far-reaching and historical. But even\nBaker\u2019s most systems-level, bird\u2019s-eye writing can\u2019t quite shake the old\nenthusiasms. Baseless, in particular, veers between the global and the\ngranular, placing Baker\u2019s harrowing research findings\u2014declassified CIA\ndocuments; evidence of inhumane epidemiological experiments conducted by the\nAir Force\u2014alongside scenes from his daily life: Quaker meetings, dreams, funny\nstuff his wife says, updates on the couple\u2019s dogs. The book unfolds like a\nFOIA document from some alternate and more transparent universe, with no part\nof political life redacted: not the unbearably gigantic horizons of atrocity\nand left defeat that loom over the American project, nor the small pleasures\nthat one might turn to in the shadow of those losses. \u201cThe recent overarmed\nera in the million-year history of our species has been difficult,\u201d he writes.\n\n> And yet think of all the greatness of the twentieth century. The music, the\n> magazines, the movies. The Russians Are Coming, for instance . . . Saul\n> Steinberg, Tracy Chapman, Nabokov, Maeve Brennan. Aretha Franklin. The\n> century of observation and improvisation.\n\nAFTER BASELESS, BAKER WAS \u201cWIPED OUT. I needed a rehabilitation program. A\nless bleak way of looking at the world.\u201d As it did for Bush himself, visual\nart seems to Baker like a good choice\u2014a way to zoom back in and return\n\u201cobservation and improvisation\u201d to central focus. In 2019, after handing in\nhis book and a few months before the pandemic began, Baker set about learning\nto paint.\n\nFinding a Likeness gathers artwork that Baker sees online and likes\u2014a nicely\negalitarian selection of nineteenth-century master portraiture, Art Deco\nmagazine illustration, and contemporary realist paintings in oil and\ngouache\u2014alongside Baker\u2019s own attempts. His first subjects recall the small\ncommonplace objects that starred in his early novels: leaves and glassware and\na metal easel clamp. He hopes to get good enough to paint clouds (\u201cpuffy,\nhuge, lunglike, breathing, hippopotami of the sky\u201d) and seeks out examples\nfrom modern art history: \u201cMaxfield Parrish\u2019s heaped, beehive-hairdo clouds\nfill me with shuddering, bulbous joy.\u201d\n\nBaker\u2019s paintings and drawings appear on nearly every page. The earliest works\nhave the lumpily dutiful quality of high school art class projects. \u201cThe brush\nwas an impossibly clumsy tool\u2014not a rational way to apply pigment to a\nsurface,\u201d he writes. (Elsewhere, more baroquely, he calls his paintbrush a\n\u201cglop-tipped eraserless mop-flopping palette-puttering art wand.\u201d) He\u2019s\nbashful about, occasionally \u201cdisgusted\u201d by, his own work, and some of the\nbook\u2019s best lines\u2014its best similes, especially\u2014come from his most self-\ncritical self-ekphrasis. One drawing \u201clooks a little like Beavis in Beavis and\nButt-Head.\u201d In a suburban landscape painting, a car \u201ccomes out looking like a\npool table.\u201d Trying another car, \u201cI lost my temper at one point and typed, \u2018I\nHATE THIS TOAD OF SHIT THAT HAS EMERGED FROM MY BRUSH.\u2019\u201d The comparison is\napt, as usual\u2014his Honda painting really does have an amphibian quality.\n\nThere\u2019s an invigorating novelty in seeing a master try something new without\nimmediately becoming virtuosic, like Ornette Coleman teaching himself to play\nthe trumpet. But it\u2019s not the first time Baker or one of his semi-\nautobiographical characters has switched forms. Before he was a writer Baker\nplayed the bassoon, and his fiction surely features American literature\u2019s\nlargest quantity of failed bassoonists. Paul Chowder, the narrator of two\nessayistic later novels, is a bassoonist turned poet who, in 2013\u2019s Traveling\nSprinkler, decides to switch gears again and write songs, as \u201ca way of paying\nattention to a single event by surrounding it with many notes.\u201d He buys a\nguitar and composes protest songs about Obama\u2019s foreign policy, plus folkie\nnumbers about his daily surroundings: \u201cNative peaches / fresh tomatoes / lots\nand lots of corn / Hot blueberries / cold chicken / and ridiculous amounts of\nporn.\u201d There is no great effort made to persuade us that these are especially\nartful songs. \u201cWhat is it when you have an urge to produce something,\u201d Chowder\nwonders, \u201cto make something, and it almost doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s good or\nnot?\u201d\n\n  * Reference photograph by Nicholson Baker.\n\n  * Painting by Nicholson Baker.\n\nThe same spirit of easygoing exploration surfaces in Finding a Likeness. Baker\ntakes a couple painting lessons, experiments with different methods and tools,\nfinds \u201cgorgeously unremarkable\u201d objects and scenes to sketch. (Central Maine,\nwhere he lives, furnishes him with all kinds of half-ugly, half-beautiful\nsubject matter. \u201cI found some good clouds near a Chipotle restaurant,\u201d he\nwrites, contentedly summing up all of contemporary America.) There are perhaps\nfewer descriptions of materials than one might expect from a writer who once\ngave us the memorable paper-goods anthem \u201cPerforation! Shout it out!\u201d but the\nmeditations on sandpaper grain and oil pastels are highly satisfying.\n\u201cPastels: loaves and lozenges and ingots of baked radiance that would stain my\nfingers and dust my optic nerve,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt\u2019s dry from the beginning. No\nbrushes needed. You just wipe your hands on your pants.\u201d\n\nAlready this is, as Baker likes to say, awfully good. But then, over the\ncourse of the book, something like his career in miniature unfurls. Baker\u2019s\ninitial interest in visual art as a means of paying attention to the inanimate\nworld\u2014to still scenes, small tools and landscapes, cool clouds\u2014gives way to a\nfascination with the human form, specifically the human face. He becomes\nprolific in portraits, sourcing references from a Reddit forum. \u201cI especially\nliked drawing smiley couples,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd parents and children, and\npeople and their dogs. Actually I liked drawing every sort of person, except\npeople with septum piercings, because it\u2019s too difficult to draw shiny\nhardware when it\u2019s lurking in the shadows of a pair of nostrils. Nostrils on\ntheir own are hard enough.\u201d Taking a light detour into art history, he argues\npersuasively that smiles, generally, are underrepresented in Western art.\n\nBaker\u2019s portraits improve in a big way as the book goes on, especially as he\nincorporates tracing into his drawing method. (Baker\u2019s search for visual\naccuracy\u2014for the sort of realist precision that his fiction has always\nelevated\u2014provides the memoir with about as much of a plot as his books ever\nhave.) The later drawings are confident and warm, especially as he begins\ndrawing his children, parents, and wife. \u201cThe thing about drawing someone you\nlove is that you have a chance to think uninterruptedly about the nature of\nyour love and the details of your love,\u201d he writes. The process, on the whole,\nforces him to look closely at his human subjects. \u201cAs soon as I began\nsketching, usually at the person\u2019s right eye, I felt a quietness and a surge\nof attentive committedness.\u201d Or, elsewhere: \u201cI drew him, and I knew him.\u201d\n\nIS IT TRUE THAT TO DRAW SOMETHING IS TO KNOW IT? I was reminded throughout\nFinding a Likeness of one of the last books by John Berger, Bento\u2019s\nSketchbook. Berger and Baker share a lot: an inviting and companionable\nappreciation for sensory experience, a gift for erotica, an unusual investment\nin seeing aesthetic beauty as it exists alongside\u2014sometimes as the result\nof\u2014imperial violence. (They also have in common a certain tactile sensibility:\nan extended analogy in Bento\u2019s Sketchbook between the mechanics of sketching\nand of piloting a motorbike\u2014\u201cYou are riding a drawing\u201d\u2014rhymes nicely with this\ndescription, in Baker\u2019s Box of Matches, of falling asleep with his wife: \u201cShe\nturned and shifted her warmly pajamaed bottom towards me and I steered through\nthe night with my hand on her hip.\u201d) Berger, of course, was a painter as well\nas a writer, and in his book, as in Baker\u2019s, annotated sketches are reproduced\nalongside short meditations on drawing and what it does to the mind. Berger\ndraws flora from his mostly rural surroundings: herbs and fruit in France, an\nolive tree in Palestine. Even more than a way of encountering place, a\nsketching practice, for Berger, was a means of finding solidarity with people.\nIn between portraits of his neighbors, the writer Andrei Platonov, and Jesus,\nhe considers the practice\u2019s effects at the human scale. When drawing, Berger\nwrites, \u201cI\u2019m aware of a distant, silent company.\u201d\n\nBaker reaches for company, too. As his skills improve, he begins sketching\nartists and political figures who have been meaningful to him. A sense of\npurpose settles in as he makes a portrait of Tracy Chapman, one of the gems of\nthe twentieth century he named in Baseless. \u201cWhen I was working on the drawing\nI was calm,\u201d he writes.\n\n> The world was a mess, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren weren\u2019t getting\n> along, but the important thing at that moment was to try to do right by\n> Tracy Chapman\u2019s wistful, glowing smile. While I worked I sang bits of her\n> songs to myself. . . . I want to do this from now on, I thought\u2014draw people\n> whose lives add beauty. And paint them, eventually.\n\nAn idiosyncratic personal portrait gallery takes shape. He draws Jean Cocteau,\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and a version of Ren\u00e9 Magritte that \u201clooked like\nGeorge Harrison.\u201d John Lewis, Ana\u00efs Nin, Nabokov, the guy who invented the\nSwingline stapler. (\u201cI used a wiry sort of style, as if all the world was made\nof bent staples.\u201d) Rachel Carson, E. B. White, a very good Jean Stafford,\nantiwar activist Frances Crowe. Susan Sontag, Gary Shteyngart, Mary Cassatt,\nAdam Schlesinger from the great power-pop band Fountains of Wayne. Even when\nhe gets his idols wrong (\u201cI got the urge to draw the founding editor of The\nNew Yorker, Harold Ross. I thought he might be easy because he has such strong\nfeatures, and such a flume of hair. I tried twice and stopped. I\u2019d made him\nlook like a boxing promoter\u201d), the process encourages a humane clarity.\nDespite Baker\u2019s self-avowed attempt to take a break from political writing, a\npacifist current surges through the book, evident in the subjects Baker has\ngathered. \u201cIt was a privilege to be tracing the outline of her cheekbone,\u201d\nBaker writes about drawing Dorothy Day, \u201cfeeling the strength of it, knowing\nhow many days and years she spent writing editorials against wars.\u201d\n\nThis is far from the hammy, self-conscious, slightly neurotic influence-\nanxiety of U and I, in which Baker the young novelist positioned Updike as a\nmaddening \u201cimaginary friend\u201d whose aesthetic shadow had to be wrestled with.\nYet it\u2019s hard not to read Finding a Likeness as a companion to Baker\u2019s first\nmemoir, a return to the questions of craft and influence that U and I set out\nto explore. Finding a Likeness is a quieter book, as Baker\u2019s later work has\ntended to be. You feel that Baker has grown out of certain things, or grown\ninto them\u2014maybe even into the \u201cair of rangy assurance\u201d that he once envied in\nUpdike. What could be more rangy and assured than showing the world your first\nwobbly artworks? (Updike, I remembered while reading the new book, was himself\na trained artist.) In place of Baker\u2019s old image-hoarding style is a less\nflashy, smudgier, more serene approach; in place of solitary preoccupations, a\nmore expansive embrace of artistic indebtedness. \u201cI started to feel that I\nwanted to spend the rest of my life doing portraits,\u201d writes Baker. \u201cIn fact I\nwanted to draw every person in the world.\u201d\n\nLisa Borst is the web editor of n+1.\n\nSHARE\n\n# Most Read\n\n  * # Lauren Oyler\u2019s meditations on Goodreads, anxiety, and gossip\n\nAnn Manov\n\n  * # Constance Debr\u00e9\u2019s novels of transformation\n\nChristine Smallwood\n\n  * # Hanif Abdurraqib writes a letter of love and loss to basketball and his home state\n\nGene Seymour\n\n  * # Lisa Selin Davis\u2019s confused history of homemakers\n\nMoira Donegan\n\n  * ABOUT\n  * BACK ISSUES\n  * ADVERTISE\n  * PRIVACY POLICY\n  * CONTACT\n\nAll rights reserved. bookforum.com is a registered trademark of 1865\nPublications LLC, New York, NY.
