These users\nmight also try to improve their perceived standing in the open source crowd by\ngetting endorsements from other accounts, which could also be using false\nidentities, sometimes known as sock puppets.\n\nThe tone of the communications will likely be friendly, but their pursuit of a\nmaintainer or foundation may be aggressive or overly persistent.\n\nIf they do manage to worm their way into a project's influential ranks, their\ncode suggestions might provide clues as to their underlying intentions.\n\nA new maintainer's code being intentionally obfuscated or difficult to\nunderstand could be a giveaway that they're trying to hide something without\nbeing detected. In the case of the xz backdoor, pull requests from Jia Tan\ncontained blobs as artifacts, for example.\n\n\"The XZ backdoor was a cleverly crafted file as part of the test suite that\nwasn't human readable, as opposed to source code,\" said Bender Ginn and\nArasaratnam.\n\nJia Tan also tried to gradually escalate security issues. Soon after they were\nable to make commits, they replaced the safe_fprintf() function with fprintf()\nwhich at the time seemed fairly innocuous, but in hindsight could have been an\nearly attempt to introduce a character escape vulnerability.\n\nMalicious outsiders may also be observed deviating from the project's typical\nbuild and deployment practices. Deviation from norms in any context should be\nviewed with raised eyebrows, but in open source, it could signal an attacker's\nintent to introduce malicious payloads into the project.\n\nThe typical behavior of phone and email scammers \u2013 a false sense of urgency \u2013\nshould be treated with caution too, since the outsider could be trying to\nforce a security review through quickly, which could potentially allow their\nnaughtiness to go undetected.\n\n  * After delay due to xz, Ubuntu 24.04 'Noble Numbat' belatedly hits beta\n  * What can be done to protect open source devs from next xz backdoor drama?\n  * Malicious xz backdoor reveals fragility of open source\n  * Malicious SSH backdoor sneaks into xz, Linux world's data compression library\n\n\"These social engineering attacks are exploiting the sense of duty that\nmaintainers have with their project and community in order to manipulate\nthem,\" said Bender Ginn and Arasaratnam.\n\n\"Pay attention to how interactions make you feel. Interactions that create\nself-doubt, feelings of inadequacy, of not doing enough for the project, etc.\nmight be part of a social engineering attack.\n\n\"Social engineering attacks like the ones we have witnessed with XZ/liblzma\nwere successfully averted by the OpenJS community. These types of attacks are\ndifficult to detect or protect against programmatically as they prey on a\nviolation of trust through social engineering.\n\n\"In the short term, clearly and transparently sharing suspicious activity like\nthose we mentioned above will help other communities stay vigilant. Ensuring\nour maintainers are well supported is the primary deterrent we have against\nthese social engineering attacks.\"\n\n### More resources, fewer problems\n\nIn addition to the steps outlined in their blog post on the matter, Bender\nGinn and Arasaratnam echoed the oft-cited issues with open source as ones to\naddress to increase the level of security in the wider community.\n\nSmall teams or lone developers are behind some of the most widely relied upon\nprojects in the world \u2013 often by commercial entities that provide little if\nanything in return \u2013 and as such can't be expected to also be the necessary\nsecurity talent too.\n\nThey pointed to existing funding projects that have already led to various\nimprovements across open source projects, such as the security-focused Alpha-\nOmega project, which is supported financially by Microsoft, Amazon, and\nGoogle.\n\n\"The OpenJS Foundation has experienced how funding developers for security has\nhad a proven impact through Alpha-Omega investments in Node.js and jQuery.\"\n\nThe German government has stepped in to offer support to the open source\necosystem through the Sovereign Tech Fund, which aims to support foundations\nlike OpenJS to strengthen infrastructure and security.\n\n\"We are advocating for more global public investment in initiatives like the\nSovereign Tech Fund to invest in [global] open source... that society depends\non, complementary to [existing] private funding,\" said Bender Ginn and\nArasaratnam.\n\n\"We recommend that public institutions learn from, adapt, and coordinate with\nGermany's Sovereign Tech Fund to support our interconnected open source\nprojects and shared digital economies.\" \u00ae\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Open Source\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Open Source\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Audacity\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Jenkins\n  * MySQL\n  * NCSC\n  * OpenOffice\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Wikipedia\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Security\n\n#### More about\n\n6 COMMENTS\n\n#### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Open Source\n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\n### More about\n\n  * Cybercrime\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Open Source\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n  * Audacity\n  * Digital Public Goods\n  * FOSDEM\n  * FOSS\n  * Jenkins\n  * MySQL\n  * NCSC\n  * OpenOffice\n  * RSA Conference\n  * Wikipedia\n\n### Broader topics\n\n  * Security\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### UK businesses shockingly unaware of how to handle security threats\n\nMany decide to make no changes after detecting a breach\n\nCyber-crime7 days | 23\n\n#### Roku makes 2FA mandatory for all after nearly 600K accounts pwned\n\nStreamer says access came via credential stuffing\n\nCyber-crime1 day | 13\n\n#### Change Healthcare\u2019s ransomware attack costs edge toward $1B so far\n\nFirst glimpse at attack financials reveals huge pain\n\nCyber-crime5 hrs | 10\n\n#### Protecting distributed branch office environments from ransomware\n\nAs ransomware becomes more sophisticated, detection tools should be upgraded\nto cover every site and location\n\nSponsored Feature\n\n#### X fixes URL blunder that could enable convincing social media phishing\ncampaigns\n\nPoorly implemented rule allowed miscreants to deceive users with trusted URLs\n\nCSO6 days | 25\n\n#### Notepad++ dev slams Google-clogging notepad.plus 'parasite'\n\nUpdated Imitator seemingly swiftly sunk from search after plea to users for\nhelp\n\nApplications7 days | 104\n\n#### Puppies, kittens, data at risk after 'cyber incident' at veterinary giant\n\nIT systems pulled offline for chance to paws and reflect\n\nSecurity8 days | 11\n\n#### Change Healthcare faces second ransomware dilemma weeks after ALPHV\nattack\n\nTheories abound over who's truly responsible\n\nSecurity8 days | 23\n\n#### Ransomware gang did steal residents' confidential data, UK city council\nadmits\n\nINC Ransom emerges as a growing threat as some ex-LockBit/ALPHV affiliates get\nnew gigs\n\nCyber-crime12 days | 17\n\n#### Ivanti commits to secure-by-design overhaul after vulnerability nightmare\n\nCEO addresses whirlwind start to 2024 and how it plans to prevent a repeat\n\nSecurity12 days | 19\n\n#### Security pioneer Ross Anderson dies at 67\n\nObituary A man with a list of accolades long enough for several lifetimes,\nfriends remember his brilliance\n\nResearch13 days | 34\n\n#### INC Ransom claims to be behind 'cyber incident' at UK city council\n\nThis follows attack on NHS services in Scotland last week\n\nCyber-crime14 days | 10\n\nThe Register Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Contact us\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n  * The Next Platform\n  * DevClass\n  * Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n  * Cookies Policy\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Ts & Cs\n\nCopyright.
