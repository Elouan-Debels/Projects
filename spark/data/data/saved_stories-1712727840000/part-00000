And I unexpectedly sold 300 copies while\nmaking it.\n\n## Idea\n\nThe idea of Kamal Handbook came after spending more time deploying with the\ntool and seeing my Kamal blog post trending.\n\nBut the thing was I didn\u2019t want to write another book. And in fact, the main\nselling point of Deployment from Scratch was that it didn\u2019t focus an any\nparticular deploy tool.\n\nKamal changed this perspective for two reasons. I genuinely liked the tool and\nI could be the first author to publish something on Kamal. I wouldn\u2019t do it if\nsuch a book existed.\n\nSo I conviced myself that if I can do this in ~ 5 weeks, I should.\n\n## Writing\n\nThe biggest change from my last book was giving myself a short window to\nfinish. This was rather a necessity because I didn\u2019t have more time.\n\nI had to return to my other projects and responsibilities.\n\nBut I knew this was possible because:\n\n  * I already figured out a lof of the configuration from running Kamal\n  * I already published 2 blog posts on the topic\n  * I didn\u2019t have a full-time job\n\nI was also more experienced in everything from writing to selling because of\nmy first book. I skipped many things I did for my first book and went straigh\nto creating.\n\nI decided to write the whole book in a single document without splitting it to\nchapter pages. This and the deadline helped me to keep the book short. 94\npages long in the end.\n\n## Preselling\n\nThis time around I skipped creating a landing page, a mailing list, or a\ncover. I went to create a Gumroad page with a temporary logo and tweet that I\nam preselling.\n\nI presold 30 copies on the first day and 42 the following one. A bigger\naudience of ~ 2900 followers and being on a trend of a new tool certainly\nhelped me big time.\n\nYou see, my first book is on a timeless topic, something every web dev should\ngo through at some point. That\u2019s great, but it misses the pressure to buy in\nthe moment.\n\nKamal Handbook is about what people are talking and figuring out right now.\nAbout the present. And that\u2019s powerful.\n\nI presold 165 copies in the end before the launch day by tweeting the progress\nI am making.\n\n## Launch\n\nThe launch happened again on Twitter. I sold 39 copies and around 100 the days\nthat followed. Since I was moving fast, I skipped some things I usually do.\n\nI did finished up the website, but I haven\u2019t even put a tracking code on it,\nso I don\u2019t know how many people were there around the launch or what the\nconversion rate is.\n\nI was also happy that I managed to get some good feedback from early readers.\nI haven\u2019t skipped this part despite all the rush. If you are writing\nsomething, always get draft feedback.\n\nI also got a lovely foreword by Donal McBreen just in time for the launch.\nThis was completely unplanned, but once I got an email from him I kindly asked\nhim for this favour.\n\nThe timing was perfect, all came together at the right time. I felt the\nmomentum and released just before Easter to have a well-deserved rest after\nthis sprint.\n\nI reached 300 copies sold some days after the launch.\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe main marketing was without a doubt my Twitter account. I haven\u2019t even\nwrote a blog post about the book this time around, I just went straigh to\nwriting.\n\nBefore launching I posted to a Rails subreddit and did an announcement in\npartnership with Short Ruby Newsletter to gain some more traction and\nmomentum.\n\nAfter the launch, I also posted to 3 more subreddits and appeared in Ruby\nWeekly. None of that move the needle by much as most of the sales already\nhappened.\n\n## Fin\n\nI had a blast making this book. I sold 360+ copies in total and got 7 five-\nstar reviews to date.\n\nI am a serial author now I guess as I have 2 books to my name.\n\nbooks kamal docker ruby\n\nAny comments?
