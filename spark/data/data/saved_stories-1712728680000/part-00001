This\n> study explores the possibility of dataset creation through crowdsourcing,\n> utilizing non-expert annotators to develop training corpora. We first extend\n> framing analysis beyond English news to a multilingual context (12\n> typologically diverse languages) through automatic translation. We also\n> present a novel benchmark in Bengali and Portuguese on the immigration and\n> same-sex marriage domains. Additionally, we show that a system trained on\n> our crowd-sourced dataset, combined with other existing ones, leads to a\n> 5.32 percentage point increase from the baseline, showing that crowdsourcing\n> is a viable option. Last, we study the performance of large language models\n> (LLMs) for this task, finding that task-specific fine-tuning is a better\n> approach than employing bigger non-specialized models.\n\nComments:| accepted at NAACL 2024  \n---|---  \nSubjects:| Computation and Language (cs.CL)  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.01481 [cs.CL]  \n(or arXiv:2404.01481v1 [cs.CL] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.01481arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Syeda Sabrina Akter [view email] [v1] Mon, 1 Apr 2024 21:02:18 UTC (682\nKB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled A Study on Scaling Up Multilingual News Framing\nAnalysis, by Syeda Sabrina Akter and Antonios Anastasopoulos\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CL\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
