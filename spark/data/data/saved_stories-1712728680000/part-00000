The cops have plans.\n\nYou know what I am, Harvey? I\u2019m a dog chasing cars. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do\nwith one if I caught it.\n\nI just do things. I am just the wrench in the gears. I hate plans.\n\nYours, theirs, everyone\u2019s. Maroni has plans. Gordon has plans.\n\nSchemers trying to control their worlds.\n\nI am not a schemer. I show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control\nthings really are.\n\nSo when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal, you know I am\ntelling the truth.\n\nI just did what I do best. I took your plan and turned it on itself.\n\nLook what I have done to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of\nbullets.\n\nNobody panics when the expected people get killed. Nobody panics when things\ngo according to plan, even if the plan is horrifying.\n\nIf I tell the press that tomorrow a gangbanger will get shot or a truckload of\nsoldiers will be blown up, nobody panics\u2014because it\u2019s all part of the plan.\n\nBut when I say that one little old mayor will die, everybody loses their\nminds.\n\nIntroduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order and everything\nbecomes chaos.\n\nI am agent of chaos.\n\nAnd you know the thing about chaos Harvey?\n\n\u201cIt is FAIR.\u201d\n\nThat was one of those moments in the cinema when you\u2019re sitting there and\nyou\u2019re like, you know, the bad guy is making a lot of sense. Now, I\u2019m not\ngoing to blow up any hospitals, but I do want to talk about the futility of\nplans. God laughs at our plans. You want to know what I do to prepare for\ninterviews? Nothing! Because the unplanned is better than the planned. The\nspontaneous is better than the rehearsed.\n\nIf you make your living in the financial markets, you are familiar with the\nways of chaos. We all have plans for trades. I\u2019m going to buy it at X and sell\nit at Y and make Z. How often does that work out? It has worked out precisely\none time in my entire career. Shit goes sideways. You adapt, and improvise.\nI\u2019m sure you know people who plan out every aspect of their lives, and\ncorrespondingly, they are not so good at adapting and improvising.\n\nI make plans. But the plans are basically just a rough outline. A good example\nof this is air travel. If you are not able to adapt and improvise with air\ntravel, you are going to be miserable. I was on a flight from Hartford to DCA\na few days ago, and a toddler got some allergic reaction while we were sitting\non the tarmac, waiting to take off. Back to the gate. I was going to miss my\nconnection. Did I freak out? No, I adapted and improvised. I texted a college\nbuddy who lived in DC and asked if I could crash at his place. As it turned\nout, it wasn\u2019t necessary, because I made my connection anyway, because my\nconnecting flight was late, too. Either way, my heart rate did not go up one\nbpm. I had extra clothes. I had a toothbrush. I was going to be fine.\nSometimes, shit happens, which refers directly to the futility of plans.\n\nThe communists in communist countries make 100-year plans. Everyone talks\nabout this with the Chinese. Oooh, they\u2019re so smart, they\u2019re thinking out 100\nyears. Then, a year later, the plans are totally useless. The U.S. government\nlurches from one crisis to another, without any clear plans. Actually, this is\nthe correct way to do things. And besides, in a democracy, there is no\ncontinuity from administration to administration, so long-term plans are\npointless. I get the impression that this is how Elon Musk manages, constantly\nputting out fires and dropping bombs on Twitter. It seems to work for him!\nBoeing, on the other hand, has plans, thinking out thirty years. Yet they\ncannot see the trees for the forest.\n\nI have some plans to do things in the coming years. Like I said, they are\nrough outlines. I know I will encounter some challenges along the way, and\nthen I will adapt and improvise. Things are never as easy as they seem. But\nyou solve one problem, then another problem, then another problem. Teachers\ncan plan, more or less. You can write up a syllabus and stick to the syllabus.\nIn the business world, you can\u2019t plan\u2014it\u2019s too dynamic of an environment.\nFossil probably thought things were pretty good until the Apple Watch came\nalong. Stock down 90%. Nobody saw that one coming. Blackberry probably thought\nthings were pretty good until the iPhone came along. Nobody saw that one\ncoming. All it takes is about twelve months for you to be disrupted out of\nexistence.\n\nIn my writing, I don\u2019t plan. I didn\u2019t plan this piece. I figured I\u2019d start\nwith The Joker speech and go from there, and see where it took me. When I\nwrite short stories, I never know how they are going to end. Whenever I plan\nmy writing, it ends up immeasurably worse. All the Evil of This World is a\nmaddeningly complex book. There is a lot of engineering between the different\noverlapping storylines. You might think I would have mapped it out in a\ndiagram ahead of time. Nope, started on page 1, went to page 2, and at the\nend, I had a book. The most I will ever do for a book is have a chapter\noutline, which I had for No Worries. I will admit to doing chapter outlines\nfor books. But that is all the planning I will ever do. Because the unplanned\nis better than the planned. The spontaneous is better than the rehearsed.\n\nThis is the point in the piece where I point out that capitalism is entirely\nunplanned. You have a phone. Someone had to design the phone, which required\nchip experts and software experts and hardware experts. Manufacturing takes\nplace somewhere around the world, with different contractors and\nsubcontractors providing various parts for the phone. The materials for those\nparts were obtained from around the globe. And you know what? There is no\nphone czar sitting in Washington, DC orchestrating all these activities. Each\nperson working for their own benefit, for the mutual benefit of others. Nobody\nhad to be told what to do. That\u2019s magic. That is the kaleidoscopic energy of\ncapitalism. Planning an economy has been tried, and it results in chronic\nshortages and hardship. No one person can anticipate and organize the\nactivities of millions of people, and the result is crushing deprivation.\nBecause the unplanned is better than the planned. The spontaneous is better\nthan the rehearsed.\n\nBloomberg was a good mayor in many respects, but he was a planner. And I\nsuppose at Bloomberg LP, where you have all that recurring terminal revenue\ncoming in, you have that luxury. In particular, I am thinking of the effort to\nreroute traffic around Times Square by cutting off Broadway and turning the\nentire place into a giant pedestrian walkabout. Not long after that happened,\nyou had costumed characters and the desnudas, along with the return of crime\nand drug dealing. I watched a midnight showing of The Crow in Times Square in\n1994 and felt safer than walking through there today in broad daylight. That\u2019s\nby far the least egregious intervention in New York City that I can think of,\nbut probably the most visible. Things are the way they are for a reason. Leave\nit the fuck alone.\n\nI do not remember the details of this story, but here is a story: there was a\ncollege with a quad where students were walking back and forth to classes. The\nplanners at the college wanted to put in an array of sidewalks to keep the\nkids from mucking up the grass. Wait, the college president said. After a few\nmonths, there were paths across the quad where the grass had given way to\ndirt. That is where they built the sidewalks. This is also known as\nspontaneous order.\n\nI do not have a high opinion of TV news shows or the people who go on TV news\nshows, but I recognize that it is a demanding discipline that requires a great\ndeal of flexibility. You have a one-hour program planned out, and then some\ndrunk sets off a car bomb in Omaha. Within seconds, you are talking about\nOmaha. It is a dynamic environment, and the hosts have to be ready for\nanything. This is true of media in general: newspapers, radio, and the like.\n9/11 happened on a Tuesday. Not sure if you knew this, but all book launches\nare on Tuesday. Some poor sap had his life\u2019s work released the day of 9/11.\nThe thing about chaos is that it\u2019s fair; sometimes you just have bad luck.\n\nI planned on doing an entire career in the Coast Guard. God laughed at my\nplans. I planned on doing an entire career on Wall Street. God laughed at my\nplans. These days, I have no idea what the hell I am going to do. I am going\nto do something if it works, and when it stops working, I will do something\nelse. I think this is the right way to live.\n\n### Subscribe to We're Gonna Get Those Bastards\n\nBy Jared Dillian \u00b7 Launched 2 years ago\n\nEverything that is depraved, especially finance, culture, music and sex.\n\n68 Likes\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 Restacks\n\n68\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The Futility of Planning\n\nwggtb.substack.com\n\n14\n\nShare\n\n14 Comments\n\nGordonApr 6To quote Eisenhower: Plans are worthless, but planning is\ninvaluable.How firmly we should expect out plans to work out depends a lot on\nour degree of control, When traveling, lots of things can happen beyond our\ncontrol, but I am sure that your new house conforms very closely to the plans\nthat you and the contractor agreed on. Probably there were a few small\nadaptations along the way, but nothing major.This reminded me of another essay\nI read over a decade ago, at this\nlink.https://www.paulgraham.com/hs.htmlExpand full commentLike (3)ReplyShare  \n---  \n  \nBrett Richards1020 ThoughtsApr 6\u201cThings are the way they are for a reason.\nLeave it the fuck alone.\u201dLike the piece, but in my experience that reason is\nquite often because that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been done or for a reason that\nis utterly inane. The corporate world is notorious for this. If you want to\nembrace disruption, and spontaneity you have to encourage changing things. The\niPhone versus blackberry is an example of this.
