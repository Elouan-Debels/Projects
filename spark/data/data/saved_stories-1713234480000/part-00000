For the\nfull map of Cosmographia posts, see here.\n\nPassage of the Jews through the Red Sea \u2014 Ivan Aivazovsky (1891) Public\nDomain.\n\nMerneptah, son of Rameses II, liked to boast. This was not an unusual trait\namong Egyptian pharaohs, or indeed of rulers across the wider ancient Near\nEast region, who had a habit of carving triumphal gloats of their military\nvictories into stone slabs called stelae. We should be glad of their boasting,\nfor unlike fragile papyri, these stelae cannot rot, and so many have survived\ninto the present, where they make for vital historical documents.\n\nUnlike his father, whom the Greeks called Ozymandias, Merneptah was not a\nparticularly notable pharaoh; he ruled only for a decade between 1213\u20131203 BC.\nIn a twist of historical irony that would have delighted Herodotus, he is now\nbest remembered for his connection to one of the peoples he boasted of\ndestroying. The \u2018Merneptah Stele\u2019 (c. 1208 BC) is mostly a recount of the\nEgyptian victory over a Libyan invasion, but the last three lines describe a\nseparate campaign in the land once known as Canaan. Carved into the 3200-year\nold block of granite is the inscription:\n\n>\n>     Israel is laid waste, its seed is no more.\n\nSo reads the earliest mention of the people who have perhaps shaped world\nhistory more than any other.1\n\nIn their own telling, the Israelites\u2019 origins begin with a single family, in\nthe first half of the second millennium BC.2 A shepherd named Abram leaves his\nhome city of Ur in Mesopotamia, and emigrates west to Canaan. Along with his\nwife, Sarah, and two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, he lives as a pastoralist on the\nperiphery of Canaanite civilisation, accumulating great wealth. As reward for\nhis good faith, God enters a covenant with Abram, promising that his progeny\nwill inherit the Promised Land (Canaan), and gives him a new name \u2014 Abraham,\nmeaning \u2018Father of Multitudes\u2019.\n\nLater in the narrative, the focus of the story moves to Jacob, Abraham\u2019s\ngrandson via Isaac. He has various adventures involving lying or cheating,\neventually culminating in a midnight wrestling match with a mysterious\nstranger, who after a night-long struggle defeats him at daybreak. The\nstranger, who turns out to be God, then gives him a new name: \u2018Israel\u2019,\nmeaning \u2018He Who Strives With God\u2019, foreshadowing the intensely personal and\nconflicting relationship the Israelites will have with their deity.\n\nIsrael (Jacob) and his descendants, hereafter known as \u2018Israelites\u2019,\neventually leave Canaan for Egypt after a terrible famine. Here they stay for\nfour centuries \u2014 four centuries which are passed over with hardly a mention in\nthe Hebrew Bible, except to say they were eventually enslaved by the Pharaoh,\nwho at the time of Exodus is often taken to be Rameses II. The Israelites are\nthen led out of Egypt by the charismatic prophet with the curiously Egyptian\nname, Moses. They wander the Sinai Desert for forty years before crossing the\nJordan River and laying waste to the land of Canaan in a bloody conquest led\nby Joshua, sacking cities like Jericho and Ai. Upon victory, the Promised Land\nis divided up among the Twelve Tribes of Israel, named for Jacob\u2019s sons, thus\nsetting the stage for rule by first the Judges, then kings.3\n\nNeedless to say, there are various problems with this narrative.\n\nJoshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still upon Gibeon \u2014 John Martin (1816)\nPublic Domain.\n\nFirst, there is the strange fact that despite their lives overlapping by\nfifteen years, there is no mention of Abraham and Jacob ever meeting. It\u2019s\ncurious that two of the three biblical patriarchs should never interact.\nStrange too is the silence of later prophets \u2014 figures like Jeremiah, Hosea,\nand the first Isaiah \u2014 on the actions of these patriarchs, who were so key to\nthe founding of the people and nation to which the prophets belong. It\u2019s\nalmost as if they didn\u2019t know they existed. Similarly confounding is the fact\nthat God should provide Moses with such richly detailed laws governing the\noperation of a temple that would not be built for another 400 years.\n\nEven more troublesome are the direct contradictions. To pick just one example\namong many, the Book of Joshua explicitly names the Canaanite cities of Gezer,\nMegiddo, and Ta\u2019anach as having been conquered by the Israelites (Joshua\n12:12-21), but later, in the Book of Judges, the same cities are listed among\nthose that were not taken by force (Judges 1:27-29).\n\nThe modern science of archaeology has provided further problems to the\nhistoricity of the text, such as the fact that the city of Jericho was clearly\nabandoned, and Ai did not even exist, at the time of their supposed conquest\nby the Israelites. Meanwhile, Abraham is explicitly said to have been related\nto a people called the Arameans, who we know did not arrive into the region\nfor another six hundred years after he is said to have died. Likewise, there\nis more than one reference in the patriarchal stories to the Philistines, who\nagain did not appear into the region for centuries after these events were\nsupposed to have taken place.\n\nAltogether, it\u2019s clear that although some of its stories are indeed very\nancient, the biblical narrative of Israel\u2019s origins was clearly written\ncenturies after the events it\u2019s purporting to describe, and was extensively\nedited and revised for various theological reasons in subsequent periods.4\nHowever, though we can\u2019t take the Israelites at their word, the Merneptah\nStele is clear evidence that they existed, and were significant enough to\nwarrant violent Egyptian repression, by 1208 BC.\n\nThis then begs the question, where did the Israelites actually come from? To\nanswer that, we must first set out the historical context of the ancient Near\nEast in the 2nd millennium BC.\n\nCanaan as it was possessed both in Abraham and Israel\u2019s dayes with with the\nstations and bordering nations \u2014 John Speed (c. 1629) Public Domain\n\nBronze Age Canaan (3000-1200 BC) saw a cycle of urban development,\nabandonment, then urban development again, as different pressures led\npopulations to flow from cities to rural hinterlands and back again. A typical\nexample is that of Jericho, the oldest walled city in the world, which may\nhave been occupied and abandoned as many as twenty times in its 11,000 year\nhistory.\n\nCanaan saw something of a golden age during the Middle Bronze Age (2000-1550\nBC) as its various city states, trade routes, and sea ports benefited from\nextensive trade across the Middle East and the Mediterranean. The city of\nByblos became such a great exporter of papyrus that its name became the Greek\nword for book \u2014 biblos (and hence, the Bible). The Phoenician cities of Tyre\nand Sidon saw their textiles traded as far away as the Atlantic coast of\nAfrica and Britain, while the port town of Gaza developed into a hub for the\nincense trade travelling up north from the Kingdom of Saba in southern Arabia.\nThese goods and more crisscrossed across Canaan, connecting the coastal cities\nwith the great empires of Egypt in the southwest, and Mesopotamia in the\nnortheast.\n\nAround 1725 BC, a mysterious Semitic people known as the Hyksos (it\u2019s debated\nwhether they were Canaanites or not) travelled out of the north to settle in\nsouthern Canaan and the Nile Delta in Lower Egypt. This came soon after the\ncollapse of the Middle Kingdom, when Egypt was divided into smaller dynasties,\nand thus the Hyksos were able to rule over the north of the country\nthemselves. This lasted for a century before the Egyptians drove them out and\npursued them across Canaan. Seeking a buffer zone and control over the\nprosperous trade routes, the subsequent New Kingdom of Egypt absorbed Canaan\ninto its empire, reducing the patchwork of city states and agrarian\nhinterlands into vassalage through brutal violence. It\u2019s thought the\npopulation declined steeply as Egypt tightened its grip.\n\nAround this time, we see two groups of people appear in Egyptian sources: the\nHabiru and Shasu. Both of these groups lived outside the major settlements,\nand were associated with violence, unrest, and disrupting trade. Habiru was a\ncatch all term given to outcasts or exiles from various ethnic and social\nbackgrounds. For a time it was thought there was a linguistic link between the\nterms \u2018Habiru\u2019 and \u2018Hebrews\u2019, but this is now thought unlikely. The Shasu, on\nthe other hand, were tribal groups of pastoral nomads that Egyptian sources\nhave ranging over territories as far apart as the Nile Delta, the Sinai\nPeninsula, and both sides of the Jordan River. Again, the term \u2018Shasu\u2019 seems\nnot to have been an ethnic marker, but more a descriptor of their nomadism\ninstead. In fact, it\u2019s possible some of the Hyksos forced out of Egypt may\nhave assimilated into the Shasu. For the next few hundred years, Egyptian\ncontrol waxed and waned over the region, but generally speaking, apart from\nsome disruption caused by the Habiru and Shasu, and bickering among Canaanite\nprinces, the area managed to recover some of its former prosperity. Though\nthis didn\u2019t last long.\n\nBy the end of the Late Bronze Age (c. 1300 BC), the entire Near East region\nwas again in turmoil. The Assyrian, Egyptian, and Hittite empires fought for\ncontrol over the vital Canaanite trade routes that lay between them. But this\nwas just the start. Bronze Age civilisations across the Eastern Mediterranean\nbegan collapsing one after another. The precise cause of events is unknown,\nbut it seems environmental changes, mass population movements, and the\ndestruction of cities \u2014 possibly by the mysterious Sea Peoples \u2014 led to the\ncollapse of Mycenaean Greece, the Kingdom of Ugarit, and the Hittite Empire,\nwhile the New Kingdom of Egypt and the Middle Assyrian Empire fell into steep\ndecline, and withdrew from Canaan.\n\nThe archaeological record shows few signs of the violence experienced\nelsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean, but Canaanite cities once again began\nto depopulate. Simultaneous to the Canaanite decline, we see two new groups\nemerge. The first appear on the flat fertile plains of the southern coast,\nwhere they seem to have peacefully settled into cities like Ashkelon, Ekron,\nand Gath. These were immigrants, a population of the Sea Peoples from the\nAegean, whom we now know as the Philistines.\n\nThe other group appear among the highlands on both sides of the Jordan River.\nThey lived in rudimentary longhouses, forming settlements of no more than a\nhundred people. Their material culture was basic, their pottery undecorated,\nand their economy based on grain, livestock, and olive cultivation. It was\nthese people whom Merneptah named in his granite stele. It was these people\nwhom he called Israel.\n\nLandscape of Canaan\u2019s highlands, similar to where the ancient Israelites first\nsettled in the region. Today this area is part of the West Bank. Photo by\nDaniel Newman.\n\nStarting in the early 20th century, there has been several competing theories\nfor the origins of these first Israelites. Generally speaking, these theories\ncan be grouped into four schools of thought.\n\nThe first, pioneered by Albrecht Alt as early as 1925, has come to be known as\nthe Peaceful Infiltration Theory. As its name suggests, the thought here is\nthat mostly peaceful pastoralists crossed the Jordan River into the Canaan\nuplands gradually, looking for new pasture for their livestock.\n\nWilliam F. Albright did not agree. Working in the 20s and 30s, he found\nevidence of a conquest in his excavation of Tell Beit Mirsim, near Mount\nHebron, that seemed to support the Book of Joshua\u2019s chronology. He thus argued\nfor what is known as the Unified Conquest Theory, that the Bible\u2019s stories of\nthe Israelite conquest of Canaan were indeed historical. Subsequent\narchaeology, as I mentioned above, has exposed problems with this idea. Many\nof the cities named in Joshua were either abandoned, had not been founded, or\nsimply show no signs of conquest, in the right time period.\n\nThe 60s, 70s, and 80s saw the emergence of another school of thought known as\nthe Social Revolution Theory. Scholars like George Mendenhall and Norman\nGottwald argued that the early Israelites were in fact lowland Canaanites and\nnot outsiders \u2014 peasants who had rebelled against their masters and fled to\nhighlands. Over time this theory was largely abandoned due to lack of\nevidence, and the fact that the Israelite settlements were far away from\nCanaanite urban centres.\n\nThe last theory to emerge was the Long Dur\u00e9e Theory. This too argued for the\nIsraelites as Canaanites, rather than outsiders new to the region. Proponents\nof this view see the Israelite settlements appearing in the highlands around\nthe Jordan as just another stage in the Canaanite cycle of urban development\nto nomadic pastoralism, back to urban development again. They argued that the\ngroup of people who came to be known as the Israelites were actually just a\ngroup of Canaanites that had left the cities of the plains for nomadic\npastoralism in the highlands. After some years as nomads, they began again the\nprocess of resettlement as they built their longhouses. However, the Iron Age\nIsraelite settlements mark a clear break in material culture from the Late\nBronze Age Canaanites, both in terms of their agricultural practices, their\npottery, and their architecture, so the idea that the Israelites were entirely\nCanaanites-turned-pastoral doesn\u2019t fit the evidence either.\n\nOne thing that became clear as the scholarship developed over the decades, is\nthat the emergence of the new Israelite settlements among the highlands around\nthe Jordan Valley c. 12th century BC was almost certainly not monolithic. The\nprocess was probably complex and uneven, which makes it hard to give any one\nconcrete answer to Israel\u2019s origins. This is reflected in the literature,\nwhich has little consensus. As is perhaps expected given the subject, the\ndebates are particularly fraught and emotionally charged.\n\nHowever, with the very large caveat that what you\u2019re about to read is the\nnarrative that makes the most sense to me,5 rather than reflecting any\nconsensus among historians, I think we can piece together a story that aligns\nwith much of the evidence, even if some of it necessarily relies on\nconjecture.\n\nJacob Wrestling with God \u2014 Bartholomeus Breenbergh (1639) Public Domain.\n\nThe last theory standing is that of the Peaceful Infiltration School, which\nposits that outsiders crossed the Jordan River and began to settle the\nhighlands in a gradual, largely peaceful process. Archaeological examination\nof the material remains suggests these people were pastoralists: first, big\ncourtyards suggest pens for large numbers of goats and sheep; second, their\nrelatively poor and minimalist pottery contrasts sharply with both that of the\nCanaanites and the Philistines. This too suggests they were nomadic\npastoralists, who had not the need or means to make more complex ceramics.\n\nGiven this pastoralist background, and their direction of arrival, it seems\nlikely that the core group of outsiders that crossed the Jordan were Shasu.\nShasu were highly mobile semi-nomadic pastoralists, and had roamed the region\nto the east and south of the first Israelite settlements for at least four\ncenturies before the longhouses begin to appear in the archaeological record.\nThough the etymology is not certain, their name seems to mean either\n\u2018pastoralist\u2019, or \u2018plunderer\u2019. The Shasu were both.\n\nThere are two Egyptian texts, from the 14th century BC and 13th century\nrespectively, which refer to \u201cThe Land of the Shasu yhw\u201d. There is\ndisagreement among scholars, but some argue this is the first appearance of\nthe Hebrew tetragrammaton, YHWH.6 If true, the Shasu brought their god with\nthem over the Jordan, just as in Joshua.7\n\nIt seems probable this group of Shasu crossed the Jordan gradually and with\nminimal violence at first, even trading with the sedentary Canaanites in the\nlowlands. After a while, the Egyptians began to reassert their control over\nthe Canaanite cities (as described in Merneptah stele, \u201cPlundered is the\nCanaan with every evil\u201d), and began to prevent their interaction with the\nnomads. Thus the Shasu were forced up into the highlands where they grew their\nown grain, being no longer able to buy it from the Canaanites. It\u2019s possible\nthat they were joined by small bands of Habiru, exiled and displaced from the\nwider centres of civilisation.\n\nHow did this group of Shasu become differentiated from the rest? Identity is\nformed in opposition. The in-group is defined as not being the out-group. I am\nEnglish because I am not French, or Scottish, or American. In the same way,\nthe Shasu who settled among the highlands forged their identity in opposition\nto the sedentary Canaanites and Egyptians in the plains below. The Shasu\nburied their dead in simple graves; the Canaanites and Egyptians built\nelaborate tombs. The Shasu used only undecorated pottery; Canaanite ceramics\nwere not just decorated, but actually signalled their position in the social\nstrata. The Shasu were egalitarian; the Egyptians and Canaanites had a strict\nsocial hierarchy.\n\nFor Israel to even be mentioned by Merneptah means that they had to be\nsignificant threat. We know the Shasu could be extremely violent when pressed,\nand it seems their numbers were swelled by both natural means and by absorbing\nother groups. As they were forging their identity among the hills, they must\nhave gotten big enough and violent enough, perhaps raiding trade caravans, to\nirritate the Egyptians sufficiently to warrant a reprisal from the Pharaoh.\nDespite his boasting of destroying Israel\u2019s seed, he clearly didn\u2019t get them\nall. After all, it\u2019s very hard to destroy nomads \u2014 they can always flee\nfurther into the hills.\n\nFrom the mid-12th century BC onwards, when the Canaanite centres were in\ndecline, the highlanders increased in number even further. It\u2019s likely they\nassimilated tribes of Canaanites like Asher, whose name is given to one of\nJacob\u2019s sons, as well as more Habiru-like groups. With less interaction with\nthe lowlands, the common identity across this diverse group in the hills\nrelaxed for a time. However, as they began to encounter a new group, the\nPhilistines, they had an enemy against which to define themselves once again.\n\nIt\u2019s as the proto-Israelites begin interacting with the Sea Peoples, that we\nsee new identity traits emerge. The Philistines loved pork, probably bringing\nthe habit with them across the sea, and they didn\u2019t practice circumcision.\nPork was not widely consumed across Canaan, so it was not much of a point of\ndifference between the Israelites and the Canaanites, but as soon as the\nhighlanders began to clash with the Philistines, they drop what little of the\nmeat they ate altogether. So it was that circumcision came to be of heightened\nimportance too.\n\nWith their numbers swelled, and their new identity emboldening them, the\nIsraelites eventually came to leave their hills. Gradually, they filled the\nvacuum left by the Canaanite and Egyptian decline in the lowlands. They\nprobably subsumed some groups of Canaanites peacefully, and clashed violently\nwith others \u2014 thus explaining the evidence of limited conquest, like that\nuncovered by Albright\u2019s excavations at Tell Beit Mirsim.\n\nHow many other groups coalesced around the original core of Shasu is an open\nquestion. Regardless, it seems a diverse group of traditions were brought\ntogether and eventually rolled into one. The nomadic ideals found in the\nBible, told via tales of shepherds, herding livestock, and animal sacrifice\nprobably come from the original core group of Shasu.\n\nThe tale of Exodus seems to suggest at least a small group of Egyptian origin\nmixed into the Israelite milieu at some stage (though the details are no doubt\ncompletely fanciful). What else explains the embarrassing fact of Moses\u2019\nEgyptian name? Interestingly, the term Israel (with the theophoric component\n-el, which comes from the name of the supreme Canaanite god) may well predate\nthe use of YHWH (shown in the -iah component of names like Josiah, Isaiah, and\nJeremiah), or at least was once separate from it; the use of divine names were\nimportant markers of identity. Perhaps a small band of Shasu, arriving late\nover the Jordan, had a distant folk memory of leaving Egypt (Egyptian sources\nspeak of Shasu bands roaming as far west as the Nile Delta), and when they\neventually crossed the Jordan to assimilate into the larger Israelite group,\nthey brought YHWH\u2019s name and the Exodus story with them (YHWH\u2019s name first\nshows up in Moses\u2019 narrative, after all). Just as Americans celebrate\nThanksgiving as though they had all arrived on the Mayflower, perhaps the\nstory of a small part of the group eventually became the founding myth for the\nlarger whole.8\n\nWe can think of the confounding stories of the patriarchs in the same way.\nMost of Abraham\u2019s activities happen in the south of Canaan, while Jacob\u2019s\nadventures take place in the north. Perhaps two groups, one from the south and\none from the north, had different myths of a great ancestor, and their\nrelation via Isaac was a later revision to bring the two folk memories\ntogether? This would explain why the two never meet, and why their gods had\ndifferent names. Similarly, we might conjecture that the many of the stories\nthat seem inspired by Babylonian and/or Sumerian myths, such as The Flood,\nsuggest a Mesopotamian group joined our band of pastoralists in the Samarian\nhighlands.\n\nRegardless of how exactly these groups and their stories came together, the\nIsraelites developed a shared cultural identity from a whole swirl of\ndifferent traditions and myths. Many peoples became one.\n\nAnd though we can\u2019t, and most likely never will, be able to precisely map the\nconvergence of the shared Israelite identity, what we can say for sure is that\nby the turn of the first millennium BC, Israel had grown large enough, and\npowerful enough, to form a kingdom that encompassed a large portion of Canaan.\n\nBattle of Jericho \u2014 Johann Heinrich Sch\u00f6nfeld (c. 1684) Public Domain.\n\nIn 1993, Gila Cook uncovered a stele among the ruins of an ancient Israelite\ncity at Tel-Dan.\n\nCarved into the basalt slab reads a 2,800-year old Canaanite inscription, and\nthe only extra-biblical archaeological reference to:\n\n>\n>     The House of David\n\n1\n\nGiven the context, the broad consensus among Egyptologists is that the word\n\u2018Israel\u2019 is being used here in reference to a people, rather than a place.\n\n2\n\nThere is no agreement over dating the patriarchal narrative (though most\nattempts seem to fall within 2000-1500 BC range). A literal reading of Kings\n6:1 points us to the 15th century for Exodus, and the 14th for the conquest of\nCanaan.\n\n3\n\nThe \u2018Twelve Tribes of Israel\u2019 is actually a misnomer, as the Bible names\nthirteen.\n\n4\n\nInterestingly, the patriarch narratives seem to hint at the polytheistic past\nof the Israelites that we explored in Part II of this series, \u2018From Many,\nOne\u2019. There is frequent mention of sacred trees and stones, and the gods\nreferenced for each of the patriarchs seem to have different monikers. We have\nthe 'Fear' of Isaac (Genesis 31:53); the 'Mighty One' of Jacob (Genesis\n49:24); and potentially the 'Shield' of Abraham (Genesis 15:1). Also, Genesis\n31:53 relates a dispute embroiling Jacob which is settled by appealing to the\njudgement of the disputing parties' respective gods, the God of Abraham and\nthe God of Nahor, with Jacob resolving it by swearing an oath to the Fear of\nhis father, Isaac. Curious, indeed.\n\n5\n\nMuch of this narrative comes from Avraham Faust, who I think makes the most\nplausible case for the Israelites\u2019 origins.\n\n6\n\nHistorians who don\u2019t think the \u2018Shasu yhw\u2019 refers to a god say instead that it\nrefers to a place. However, there are no other references to a place of that\nname in sources of the time, so personally I prefer the idea that it\u2019s\nreferring to YHWH. However, I must confess that I find the YHWH translation\nmuch more exciting, which may be swaying my judgement!\n\n7\n\nIn \u2018From Many, One\u2019, I wrote that YHWH may have originated as a storm god in\nthe land of Edom. This area was a stronghold of the nomadic Shasu. It seems\nthat a different group of Shasu went on to form the people the Israelites\ncalled the Edomites, possibly indicating that YHWH was worshipped among more\nShasu than the group that went on to become the Israelites. It makes sense\nthat nomads would have a god not rooted in a specific place of worship, as was\ncommon in Canaanite, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian culture. When you move, your\ngod needs to be able to move with you.\n\n8\n\nThe Mayflower analogy to the Exodus story comes from William G. Dever.\n\n### Bibliography:\n\n  * A History of Christianity \u2014 Diarmaid MacCulloch (2009)\n\n  * Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic \u2014 Frank Moore Cross Jr (1973)\n\n  * Dominion \u2014 Tom Holland (2019)\n\n  * Egypt, Canaan and Israel In Ancient Times \u2014 Donald B.
