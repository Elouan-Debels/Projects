The feature is currently under development for iOS\n18 and macOS 15 and should ultimately make its way to the new version of\niPadOS as well.\n\nWe were told that early pre-release versions of the operating systems also\nmake reference to a new feature dubbed \"Math Notes\" that will allow the new\nversions of Notes to leverage and communicate with Apple's Calculator\napplication.\n\nThe new in-app audio recording feature will let users record, save, and play\naudio recordings directly from the Notes app. It is expected to make its debut\nalongside the first public betas released during Apple's Worldwide Developers\nConference (WWDC) this June.\n\nWatch the Latest from AppleInsider TV\n\nPowered By\n\n10\n\nApple Music Sing!

This would allow users to, for example, add\ndescriptions or context to an audio recording made within the app.\n\nThe audio recording feature has the potential to benefit a wide array of Apple\nusers. With it, students could record their classes or lectures and then add\nnotes or screenshots of the whiteboard - all in one note. The same use case\nand overall concept could be applied to business meetings as well.\n\nRecord audio directly to a note with automatic transcriptions\n\nPeople who travel could record a guided tour of an area and later add\nscreenshots of the things mentioned in the recording. This information would,\nonce again, all be stored in a single note, making navigation relatively easy.\n\nUsers will also be able to sync the in-app recordings across all iCloud-\ncompatible devices capable of running iOS 18 or macOS 15. While the Notes app\nwill maintain iCloud compatibility, AppleInsider was told that the application\nwould be modified to reflect the planned change in branding from Apple ID to\nApple Account.\n\nAccording to those familiar with early versions of the software, the user\ninterface for the new audio recording feature will bear a strong resemblance\nto the current Voice Memos application, with near-identical graphical\nrepresentations of recorded audio, providing for a unified experience across\nApple's operating systems.\n\n## Math Notes in iOS 18\n\nIn addition to in-app audio recording, Apple is working on another new feature\nknown internally as \"Math Notes.\" The feature is said to leverage connectivity\nwith the company's Calculator app, allowing users to integrate information\nfrom Calculator within the Notes app.\n\nThough it remains incomplete at press time, the update is likely to usher in\nsupport for displaying proper mathematic notation, an essential shorthand for\nacademic, science, and engineering applications.\n\niPadOS could get a proper calculator app in iPadOS 18 to support the new Notes\nfunctionality\n\nVersions of both of these new features have long been a staple of Microsoft's\nOneNote, which has emerged as the go-to notepad of choice for curriculums and\nprofessions involving mathematical notation. It has also established itself as\none of the most popular apps on Apple's iOS and macOS App Stores.\n\nThe iOS version of the app has been reviewed almost 900,000 times, while the\nmacOS version was recently awarded with Apple's Editors' Choice award. For a\npoint of comparison, Microsoft Office for iOS \u2014 arguably one of the most\npopular apps in the world \u2014 has been reviewed 2.1 million times, while Apple's\nPages has about 179,000 reviews.\n\nMicrosoft's OneNote contains a variety of math-related features. These\nfeatures allow users to add and solve equations, create formulas from\nhandwriting, perform unit conversions, and even visualize 2D graphs in their\nnotes.\n\nApple more than likely plans to add similar features in the form of Math\nNotes. The introduction of Math Notes is also expected to coincide with the\nrelease of a redesigned calculator app for macOS, allowing for even more\nenhancements in the realm of mathematics.\n\nUsers will be able to open Math Notes from the Calculator app through a\ndedicated option or button, allowing for quick and easy navigation. The exact\nimplementation of this new feature, however, remains to be seen.\n\nBy adding Math Notes to its application, Apple could capture a portion of the\nmarket that currently relies on rival applications for work. Educators,\nstudents, scientists, and engineers are among the groups that would benefit\nfrom the addition of Math Notes.\n\n## Another round of Sherlocking\n\nGiven the established presence of in-app audio recording and mathematical\nannotation in Microsoft's OneNote, and taking into account the popularity of\nthe app, it would only make sense for Apple to try to build a capable rival in\nthe form of its own Notes application.\n\niOS 18 is expected to introduce many new features with an AI focus\n\nApple's Notes application began its life as a simple companion app for the\noriginal iPhone. Since then, its popularity has grown leaps and bounds in both\nacademia and professional use cases.\n\nThe Notes app has undoubtedly moved a long way from its humble beginnings. As\nthe use of the app increased, Apple began to update it with more impressive\nfeatures.\n\nOver the years, the application has received a steady stream of improvements.\nThis includes support for photos, tables, links, and much more. Notes can be\nprotected with a password as well for added security. Users also have the\noption to organize Notes into folders, making navigation significantly easier.\n\nWith these most recent enhancements \u2014 in-app audio recording and Math Notes -\nApple aims to make Notes the go-to note-taking app for every type of note and\nevery type of user. Math Notes will take their place alongside other types of\nnotes, such as business plans, receipts, shopping lists, and much more - all\nin one app.\n\nWe will likely see these features make their debut in early June at WWDC 2024.\nIt is important to consider, though, that Apple has been known to cancel\nfeatures or delay them to subsequent operating system releases. As a result,\nthere is always a chance the company will alter its plans \u2014 in whole or in\npart \u2014 for one reason or another.\n\nWhile Apple Notes will join several other default iOS apps in receiving\nfeature enhancements in iOS 18 and macOS 15, it's Artificial intelligence that\nis expected to command the spotlight when Apple formally takes the wraps off\nits next-gen operating systems at WWDC on June 10.\n\n## Rumor Score\n\n\ud83e\udd2f\n\n### Likely\n\nFollow AppleInsider on Google News\n\n10 Comments\n\n## 10 Comments\n\n## bloggerblog\n\nsaid about 4 hours ago\n\nI hope you\u2019ll at least be able to copy a URL and paste it on top of a word so\nit\u2019ll automatically be a link.\n\nI\u2019m glad to hear Apple is working on improving Notes.\n\n## greg.edwards69\n\nsaid about 4 hours ago\n\nIf Apple Notes is to truly compete with OneNote, then it needs to be cross-\nplatform. I use a Windows PC at work, and as such, use OneNote for work-\nrelated notes. In a way, it's useful that it is separate from my personal\nnotes, but it would be useful if I had direct access to my Apple Notes within\nWindows. Or at least update the cloud web browser version to bring feature\nparity with the native mac/ios versions as it's currently missing crucial\nfeatures.\n\n## dewme\n\nsaid about 4 hours ago\n\nApple Notes could certainly benefit from some functional improvements. I\u2019d\nlove to see it upgraded with far better outlining capabilities, which is one\nof the things that attracted me to OneNote many years ago at version 1.0. Over\nthe years I\u2019ve been using OneNote less and less mainly because it has a very\nconvoluted user interface and it long ago reached the point of feeling onerous\nand bloated. At one point it incorporated (and may still have) a shared\nwhiteboarding capability. No matter how many times I tried to use it, everyone\nincluding myself found it clumsy and unintuitive. Maybe it\u2019s better now, but\nI\u2019m not going to bother with it. Other features in OneNote seemed to suffer\nfrom some of the same difficulties as MS Word, like font and style\ninstabilities. But the table functions work well, which Apple obviously took\nnote of.\n\nEventually my frustrations with OneNote (on all platforms) led me to try more\nlightweight applications like SimpleNote and Apple Notes. Neither of these\ncome close to OneNote in terms of total functionality or capabilities.\nHowever, I\u2019ve dialed back my expectations and limped along with whatever these\nprograms do offer. For jotting down a quick note or capturing an idea there\u2019s\nnothing faster than SimpleNote, which is so basic that it makes Apple Notes\nfeel \u201cheavy.\u201d I also use Textastic for note taking and it has the superb\nability to format programming language code/text rather nicely. A similar\ncapability in Apple Notes may be nice, but it\u2019s probably too domain specific\nfor most Apple users.\n\nI\u2019m totally in favor of Apple adding more capabilities and refinement to\nNotes. At the same time I\u2019m hoping they don\u2019t go too far like I feel Apple did\nwith OneNote. Keep it small, light, fast, and intuitive and always say focused\non the user experience without compromise.\n\n## paisleydisco\n\nsaid about 3 hours ago\n\nThe European socialist Commission will come knocking! And let\u2019s not forget the\nDOJ will claim Apple has a monopoly on its own Notes app.\n\n## mike1\n\nsaid about 3 hours ago\n\nI really hope they separate the scanning capability from Notes.\n\nIt really should be part of Camera. Open camera app, select scan, take pic\n(scan). Ask me what to do with it (like a screenshot does). Message, email,\nsave to Photos or Files, save as Note etc.\n\nI often need to send PDF scans of documents. I never need to save them as a\nnote.\n\nUsing this feature as a part of Notes adds a lot of unnecessary steps and time\nto the process, including deleting the unnecessary note I just created.\n\nRead More on our Forums\n\n## Sponsored Content\n\n## Clean junk files from your Mac with Intego Washing Machine X9\n\n## Top Stories\n\n## Game emulator Delta arrives on App Store after controversies\n\n## Apple's iOS 18 AI will be on-device preserving privacy, and not server-side\n\n## Apple wants to make grooved keys to stop nasty finger oil transfer to\nMacBook Pro screens\n\n## When to expect every Mac to get the AI-based M4 processor\n\n## Lowest price: Apple's M3 MacBook Air 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 10C GPU drops to\n$1,349\n\n## Latest comparisons\n\n## M3 15-inch MacBook Air vs M3 14-inch MacBook Pro \u2014 Ultimate buyer's guide\n\n## M3 MacBook Air vs M1 MacBook Air \u2014 Compared\n\n## M3 MacBook Air vs M2 MacBook Air \u2014 Compared\n\n## Latest News\n\n## First third party App Store in the EU is live\n\nFollowing changes in iOS 17.4 and legislation allowing them, the first new\nalternative app store has launched in the EU, that promises to help distribute\n\"indie\" apps at a low-cost yearly fee.\n\nAmber Neely | 15 minutes ago\n\n0\n\n## Game emulator Delta arrives on App Store after controversies\n\nFollowing controversy over the weekend, the Delta game emulator has been made\navailable in the App Store, for potential users outside of the European Union.\n\nMalcolm Owen | 18 minutes ago\n\n0\n\n## All of the specs of the iPhone SE 4 may have just been leaked\n\nA leak that is chiefly rounding up previous rumors about the iPhone SE 4 has\nadded that it will have AI-based camera features, and contrary to\nexpectations, will resemble the iPhone 13 more than the iPhone 14.\n\nRumor Score\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Possible\n\nWilliam Gallagher | 32 minutes ago\n\n5\n\n## The 'For All Mankind' universe is about to get a whole lot bigger\n\nApple TV+ hit \"For All Mankind\" has been renewed for a fifth season, and a\nspin-off is also going back to the beginning for a new look at the Soviet\nspace race.\n\nWilliam Gallagher | 1 hour ago\n\n0\n\n## How to make Apple Music more private by turning off 'Discoverable by Nearby\nContacts'\n\nApple Music has a setting that automatically opts users into sharing your\nmusical tastes with contacts by default.
