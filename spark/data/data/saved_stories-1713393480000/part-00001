(image created in\nShutterstock)\n\nAspiring writers have often tried their hand at teaching. They have usually\nassumed that it would be an undemanding occupation for someone educated in the\nhumanities, and would give them an income and even a place to live. Between\n1902 and 1932 four young English writers \u2014 D. H. Lawrence, Aldous Huxley,\nEvelyn Waugh and George Orwell \u2014 became schoolmasters, with varying degrees of\nsuccess.\n\nIn practice, all four were unsuited to the job. They found the prevailing\nculture of their schools intolerable and disliked the narrow-minded way they\nhad to teach. They had recalcitrant and comatose students, witnessed bullying\nand homosexuality, and were still subject to the hazardous authority, rituals\nand whims of the headmaster. They particularly hated to administer corporal\npunishment, then a commonly accepted form of discipline.\n\nLawrence and Orwell were lively and innovative teachers, Huxley and Waugh\nhopeless and hostile, but all four were bored with the traditional curriculum,\nand tired of struggling to maintain order in the classroom. They loathed the\nschools that interfered with their writing and left as soon as possible to\npursue their literary careers. They later fictionalised and often satirised\ntheir teaching experiences: Lawrence in The Rainbow, Huxley in Antic Hay,\nWaugh in Decline and Fall and Orwell in A Clergyman\u2019s Daughter.\n\nI\n\nLawrence came from a working-class background and went to Nottingham High\nSchool. The other three more privileged writers returned to the regimented\nworld and miserable memories of their public (i.e. private) schools. Lawrence\nfirst began his working life in a Nottingham factory making surgical\nappliances. When he was too ill to return to the factory, he chose teaching to\nescape from manual labour. Of the four, only Lawrence was thoroughly trained\nfor the profession and taught in state schools. From 1902 to 1906 he became a\npupil teacher in Eastwood, his native village, and bitterly recalled his poor\nsalary, lack of ambition and hatred of school teaching.\n\nColleagues noted Lawrence\u2019s defects, but were more positive about his\nenthusiasm and knowledge: \u201cLawrence never seemed to be cut out for a teacher\nat all. He was very quick-tempered and erratic, and when he was annoyed with\nhis class his face used to colour up very quickly. But as a teacher he was\nvery good, seemed very well read and knew something about everything. . . He\nhadn\u2019t much patience at all, and if the boys defied him, that did it. He\ncouldn\u2019t stand that.\u201d He would get angry when contradicted or opposed. Though\nhe disliked teaching, he was effective in the classroom and received an\nexcellent reference from his headmaster, who wrote: \u201cI have been in charge of\nthese schools for 28 years, and during that period we have had many teachers,\nbut none of greater promise than Lawrence.\u201d\n\nAfter training in Eastwood, Lawrence graduated from Nottingham University. In\n1908 he began teaching in an elementary school in Croydon, a poor district of\nsouth London, at an annual salary of \u00a395 (the same earnings as his father, a\nminer). He stayed for the next three years. His friend and fellow-teacher\nHelen Corke observed that he was poor at sports and school discipline, and did\nnot get on well with his more narrow-minded colleagues. But they were later\nimpressed by his forceful character: \u201cWhen they had had some experience of his\nintellectual fearlessness and power of passionate argument, they paid him a\ngrudging respect and stayed out of his way. He puzzled and disturbed them by\nhis ironic treatment of their accepted and unquestioned standards of work and\nliving.\u201d\n\nAnother colleague noted: \u201cLawrence was intolerant of authority. While imposing\nhis own rule rigorously upon his pupils, he rebelled against any such process\nbeing applied to himself.\u201d But it was essential for Lawrence to retain his own\nfreedom while controlling his students. His teaching methods\u2014especially in\nbotany, drawing, acting and singing\u2014were innovative and designed to encourage\nrather than repress the spontaneity of his students. But it was hard to\nintroduce them to fifty unruly boys. Lawrence complained of the long hours,\nfetid atmosphere, tedious administrative rules, lack of time and energy to\nwrite, difficult and rather stupid students, and the need to inflict corporal\npunishment.\n\nIn letters of 1908, Lawrence explained his wretched struggles to maintain\ndiscipline without resorting to the cane:\n\nSchool is a conflict\u2014mean and miserable\u2014and I hate conflicts. I was never born\nto command. I do not want to command. So the lads and I have a fight, and I\nhave a fight with my nature, and I am always vanquished. The kids are rough\nand insolent as the devil. I had rather endure anything than this continual,\npetty, debasing struggle. I put up with them until I can stand them no longer,\nthen I land the nearest, and as likely as not, he\u2019s innocent.\n\nHe told a friend, \u201cI\u2019ll not go on. The Education Committee has had blood and\ntears out of me for a hundred a year. I\u2019ll not endure it. I\u2019d rather work on a\nfarm.\u201d\n\nIn his essay \u201cEducation of the People\u201d, Lawrence expressed anger about the\ndifficult and sometimes impossible role of the \u201cmongrel\u201d schoolteacher, who\nmust uphold false values: \u201cThe elementary school-teacher is in a vile and\nfalse position. Set up as a representative of an ideal which is all toffee,\ninvested in an authority which has absolutely no base except in the teacher\u2019s\nown isolate will, he is sneered at by the idealists above and jeered at by the\nmaterialists below, and ends by being a mongrel, with every shred of natural\npride ground out of him.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 1911 pneumonia allowed him to escape from teaching in Croydon.\n\u201cThe last fortnight I have felt really rotten,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit is the dry heat\nof the pipes in school, and the strain\u2014and the cold. I must leave school,\nreally.\u201d Then, with a dire early warning, he explained, \u201cthe doctor says I\nmustn\u2019t go to school again or I shall be consumptive.\u201d Sixteen years later he\nstill expressed his nightmarish anxiety about teaching: \u201cOne of my troubled\ndreams, sleep-dreams, I mean, is that I am teaching and that I\u2019ve clean\nforgotten to mark the register, and the class has gone home! Why should I feel\nso worried about not having marked the register? But I do.\u201d\n\nLawrence returned to this emotionally exhausting time in his portrayal of\nUrsula Brangwen\u2019s teaching at St. Philip\u2019s School in chapter 13 of The Rainbow\n(1915). She felt drained by forcing the savage children to learn and horrified\nby beating the blubbering boys. When Ursula faced the class she seemed to lose\nher identity and \u201cfelt utterly non-existent. She had no place nor being\nthere.\u201d Her ugly Victorian school is hellish, and she is exhausted and\noverwhelmed by the claustrophobic atmosphere, by the effort to teach and to\ndiscipline, by\n\nthe horrid feeling of being shut in a rigid, inflexible air, away from all\nfeeling of the ordinary day. . . . The school squatted low within its railed,\nasphalt yard, that shone bleak with rain. The building was grimy, and\nhorrible, dry plants were shadowily looking through the windows. . . . She\ncould not bear it when the boy was beaten. It made her sick. She felt that she\nmust go out of this school, this torture place. . . .\n\nThe teaching hours were too long, the tasks too heavy, and the disciplinary\ncondition of the school too unnatural for her. . . . It was agony to the\nimpulsive, bright girl of seventeen to become distant and official, having no\npersonal relationship with the children. . . .\n\nAnd the children were simply awful. You\u2019ve got to make them do everything.\nEverything, everything has got to come out of you. Whatever they learn, you\u2019ve\ngot to force it into them\u2014and that\u2019s how it is. . . . The teaching hours were\ntoo long, the tasks too heavy, the disciplinary condition of the school too\nunnatural for her. She was worn very thin and quivering.\n\nThe most degrading and agonising incident occurs when she is forced to beat a\nvicious and violent boy. He resists her and fights back as she becomes\nbrutalised and humiliated:\n\nShe snatched the cane from the desk, and brought it down on him. He was\nwrithing and kicking. She saw his face beneath her, white, with eyes like the\neyes of a fish, stony, yet full of hate and horrible fear. And she loathed\nhim, the hideous writhing thing that was nearly too much for her. In horror\nlest he should overcome her, and yet at the heart quite calm, she brought down\nthe cane again and again, whilst he struggled making inarticulate noises, and\nlunging vicious kicks at her.\n\nTo add to the horror, the boy\u2019s mother comes to the school and complains about\nUrsula\u2019s cruel treatment of her son, who has a weak heart. The beating leaves\nwelts on his body, which she threatens to show to a doctor. Ursula didn\u2019t know\nabout his weak heart and is now terribly vulnerable. She wonders if the mother\nwants a bribe and fears she might even charge her with assault, but she merely\ncomplains to the headmaster, who hates Ursula. She hates the school and\nwonders \u201cwhy, why had she leagued herself to this evil system where she must\nbrutalise herself to live?\u201d Finally, she gets a bad classroom report and,\nconvinced she\u2019s not meant to be a teacher, leaves the school.\n\nII\n\nLawrence, even as a boy, always felt there was something mean in tormenting a\nteacher. But the sophisticated older boys at the elite Eton College, the\nantithesis of Lawrence\u2019s state schools, were just as difficult to handle and\nmerciless to the half-blind Aldous Huxley. In 1917 Huxley, a 23-year-old Old\nEtonian who had published two volumes of poetry, replaced a master serving in\nthe war and vainly tried to teach English and French. He could not clearly see\nthe boys\u2019 faces, so it was easy and amusing to trick him when he took the\nroll. If a boy wanted to skip class, he could get a friend to call out his\nname. Huxley lamented, \u201cI have to go and stand up and face these sinister\nyoung men and try to keep them amused.\u201d Inexperienced and insecure, he hated\nevery minute he had to spend in the classroom.\n\nBut he was not interested in teaching, could not make his subject interesting\nand confessed, \u201cI find that I am not cut out for a teacher of boys; or rather\nI find that all my knowledge, such as it is, is quite of the wrong sort;\nremote and vague.\u201d He finally gave up classroom teaching, but still had the\nboring and arduous task of tutoring \u201cfifty older boys coming in for half an\nhour each week to have their essays commented upon.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues were remote and alien, he had no intellectual companions and\nfelt lonely.\n\nHe thought \u201cthis teaching takes it out of one\u201d and escaped to weekends in\nLondon whenever he could.\n\nOne of Huxley\u2019s pupils, the future music critic and novelist Edward Sackville-\nWest, recalled: \u201cHe must have been one of the most incompetent schoolmasters\nwho ever faced a class. His solution was to read aloud, with occasional\ncomments on the poems of Verlaine. This he did in his scholarly, highly\nmodulated voice. It was impossible to hear more than an occasional word of\nwhat he read or said for the general tumult was indescribable. . . . From time\nto time, Aldous would pause, look up, and say, in an imploring tone, \u2018Oh! Do\nbe quiet!\u2019 No one took the slightest notice.\u201d\n\nSteven Runciman, another pupil and later a distinguished historian of\nByzantium and the Crusades, felt that Huxley didn\u2019t know how to reach the boys\nand taught them very little. But he appreciated the quality of Huxley\u2019s mind\nand wrote: \u201cThat elongated, stooping, myopic figure seemed somehow ageless,\nand usually hidden by an infinite variety of spectacles, had eyes that were\nalmost sightless and almost uncomfortably observant. He stood there looking\nsomething of a martyr, but at the same time extraordinarily distinguished. . .\n. [Our misbehaviour] left him completely indifferent and unmoved.\u201d Blind and\nunaware, he was incapable of controlling the chaos. \u201cI cannot say that Aldous\nwas a good teacher in the narrow sense of the word, I have to confess that I\ncannot now remember a single thing he taught us. But he was an educator in the\nwider sense. He showed a glimpse of the fascination to be found in an\nunhampered intellectual approach to things.\u201d\n\nHis pupil George Orwell was also fascinated by his highly eccentric and rather\nmiserable teacher, and particularly admired Huxley\u2019s use of elegant and\nunfamiliar words and phrases. He saw beyond Huxley\u2019s physical disability and\npathetic attempts to maintain order, and (like Lawrence) disliked the cruel\njeers of his fellow students. Always defending the underdog, he stood up for\nHuxley because he found him unusual and interesting.\n\nHuxley put all his dislike of teaching at Eton into his novel Antic Hay\n(1923). Bored and sceptical during school prayers while teaching at Eton,\nGumbril thinks of how to invent trousers with pneumatic seats. He looks around\nthe chapel and snobbishly observes the misfits: \u201cThere were two ugly, stupid-\nlooking louts, who ought to have been apprenticed years ago to some useful\ntrade. Instead of which they were wasting their own and their teacher\u2019s and\ntheir more intelligent comrades\u2019 time in trying, quite vainly, to acquire an\nelegant literary education.\u201d\n\nIn the evening \u201che stayed at home in his lodgings to correct the sixty-three\nHoliday Task Papers which had fallen to his share. They lay, thick piles of\nthem, on the floor beside his chair; sixty-three answers to ten questions\nabout the Italian Risorgimento. With a sigh of disgusted weariness, Gumbril\nlooked at his papers. No, this was really impossible.\u201d Expressing Huxley\u2019s\ndeep despair, his hero reflects on his agonizing day in class and penitential\nevening with the dreadful papers, and thinks he can\u2019t endure it: \u201cIf only one\nhad work of one\u2019s own, proper work, decent work. Definitely, it couldn\u2019t go\non, it could not go on. There were thirteen weeks in the summer term, there\nwould be thirteen in the autumn and eleven or twelve in the spring; and then\nanother summer of thirteen, and so it would go on forever.\u201d So he decides to\nleave the school and live as best he could on his modest allowance of \u00a3300 a\nyear (which was, however, still more than three times the salary Lawrence had\nearned as a state school teacher).\n\nIII\n\nWaugh didn\u2019t finish his degree at Oxford; Orwell had joined the Burmese police\nand didn\u2019t go to university. But the scholastic agency Gabbitas & Thring\nalways had vacancies for unqualified young men eager for a job. In his \u201cLetter\nto Lord Byron\u201d (1937), Auden told the poet Louis MacNeice how the desperate\nwere recruited:\n\nThe only thing you never turned your hand to\n\nWas teaching at a boarding school.\n\nToday it seems a profession that seems grand to\n\nThose whose alternative\u2019s an office stool;\n\nTo many an unknown genius postmen bring\n\nTyped notices from Rabbitarse and String.\n\nIn 1925 Waugh taught History, Latin and Greek for \u00a3160 a year at Arnold House,\na boarding school situated in the tiny windswept town of Llanddulas on the\nnorth coast of Wales. There was nothing to do but drink in that remote\nvillage. He hoped, Martin Stannard writes, that \u201cthe job would provide a\nsubsistence wage for minimal effort,\u201d and time to draw and write:\n\u201cFictionalising his purgatory was his only relief.\u201d\n\nIsolated from the glittering social world of London and Oxford, Waugh felt\nalienated and neglected \u201clike a criminal transported to an outpost of\ncivilisation\u201d. From the outset the shy, rather sullen new teacher despised the\nplace and called the bad school a \u201csorry waste of time and energy. I do not\nthink that I am good at teaching\u2014at any rate I have not succeeded so far in\ngetting any idea into anyone\u2019s head.\u201d He made no great effort to teach, but if\na boy showed any interest he tried to satisfy it. His laissez-faire attitude\nwent over well. He ignored the lazy pupils and let the older boys read French\nnovels instead of swotting up their history lessons. But he was tired and\nbored, neglected his work, shouted at the boys and even caned one of them for\nblasphemy.\n\nThe headmaster would wander into the common room and vaguely say, \u201cThere are\nsome boys in that classroom. I think they are the First or perhaps the Fourth.\nWill someone go & teach them Maths or Latin or something.\u201d No one volunteered\ntill the least lazy was forced out of his comfortable chair. The staff was\ncomprised of lunatics, criminals and bores, and he found no sympathetic\ncolleagues. Finally, Waugh was almost glad to be sacked for his half-hearted\nattempt to seduce the young matron as she emerged from the bathroom in her\ndressing-gown. He found himself \u201cin a state of joy which increased to ecstasy\nas the long journey to London came to its end.\u201d\n\nDecline and Fall (1928), his first novel, satirises his scholastic experience.\nThe hero Paul Pennyfeather must teach fifty or sixty boys ranging from ten to\neighteen Classics, English, Maths, German and French, as well as competitive\nathletics, carpentry, fire-drill and music, all for \u00a3120 per year. He was\nnever meant to be a schoolmaster, and is told on arrival that there\u2019s no\ndiscipline and that he\u2019ll hate the school. He found \u201cpositive relish in making\ntheir lessons as tedious as the subject (very easily) allowed\u201d, never\nsucceeded in keeping the disorderly students quiet and felt deep self-pity.\nBut \u201cit was tacitly agreed that when Paul wished to read or to write letters\nhe was allowed to do so undisturbed while he left the boys to employ the time\nas they thought best.\u201d Asked about the pupils in his care, he replied that\nthey\u2019ll \u201cbe all right. The little beasts can\u2019t make any more noise than they\nusually do.\u201d He then gleefully adds \u201cI have never known them better. I have\njust caned twenty-three boys.\u201d\n\nAll the masters are unqualified and dismissed for the usual reasons:\nincompetence, homosexuality, or both. In A Little Learning (1964) Waugh writes\nthat the only qualification needed for a job in a public school was belonging\nto the same social class: \u201cHowever incomplete one\u2019s education, however\ndissolute one\u2019s habits, however few the respectable guarantors whom one could\nquote, the private schools lay open to anyone who spoke without a [regional]\naccent and had been through the conventional routine of public school and\nuniversity.\u201d Waugh notes of the public schools: \u201cOne goes through four or five\nyears of perfect hell at an age when life is bound to be hell anyway, and\nafter that the social system never lets one down.\u201d\n\nThe model for Captain Grimes in his novel had been \u201cexpelled from Wellington,\nsent down from Oxford and forced to resign his commission in the army.\u201d Since\nheadmasters would never admit they had hired such a bounder, they wrote\nglowing recommendations to get rid of him, and he kept getting better and\nbetter jobs. But when Dr. Fagan, the headmaster, reaches the limit of his\ntolerance, he says of Captain Grimes, his future son-in-law: \u201cI could have\nforgiven him his wooden leg, his slavish poverty, his moral turpitude and his\nabominable features . . . if only he had been a gentleman.\u201d\n\nWaugh hated the people as well as the place. He attacks the local Celts (as\nKingsley Amis would later do in Lucky Jim) and declares, \u201cThe Welsh are the\nonly nation in the world that has produced no graphic or plastic art, no\narchitecture, no drama. They just sing. . . . They are depraved because they\ncannot discern the consequences of their indulgence.\u201d\n\nHis half-hearted suicide attempt, accompanied by a pedantic farewell note in\nGreek but foiled by a swarm of stinging jellyfish, was probably a bit of comic\nplay-acting. Like Lawrence, Waugh later recalled, \u201cFor some years I was\nhaunted by the dream that I was back at that school.\u201d Stannard concludes,\n\u201cPaul Pennyfeather represented what Waugh had most feared he might become\u2014a\nfailure at Oxford, a contented schoolmaster, a dupe to romantic passion and\nconfidence tricksters, a drifter rather than an incisive force in the world.\u201d\n\nIV\n\nFrom April 1932 to July 1933, Orwell taught and lived in The Hawthornes School\nfor Boys in Hayes, west London, near what is now Heathrow Airport. Housed in a\nformer vicarage, the school had only two masters and about fifteen boys (seven\nin each class) from age ten to sixteen. They were mostly the sons of\nshopkeepers, office employees, small businessmen and professionals. Geoffrey\nStevens, whose father owned a joinery firm, was a thirteen-year-old pupil. He\nremembers how Orwell, never smartly dressed, disguised his six-foot, two-inch\nheight by slouching. He fascinated the boys by showing the scar on his wrist\nfrom a hornet\u2019s bite in Burma. Stevens thought he was an introvert and that\nhis mind was elsewhere: \u201cHe would sit at his desk and start smiling and no one\nknew what he was laughing at. He was aware that this was strange, so if it\nhappened at mealtimes, he would turn around and feed the proprietor\u2019s parrot\nto hide his face.\u201d\n\nOrwell taught every subject: English, French, History, Geography and Maths\n(there was no science). He seemed to enjoy teaching and was the best teacher\nin the school\u2014not a great honour since there were only two. There were no\ntextbooks and he had to make up his own lessons. He didn\u2019t read to the class,\nnor recommend his favourite authors, but was keen on essay writing, and had\nthe boys memorise forty lines of Shakespeare from The Merchant of Venice and\nThe Tempest.\n\nHe never raised his voice but was a strict disciplinarian. He kept a thick\ncane near his desk, used it frequently (as he had with his servants in Burma)\nand \u201cwould cane you unmercifully at the slightest provocation\u201d. When the boys\nbrought their work up to his desk, he would prod them in the stomach with a\nruler. Stevens once returned to his seat and playfully imitated his teacher by\nprodding the boy next to him. Orwell caught him in the act and gave him six of\nthe best. Though Stevens thought the punishment excessive and unjust, he felt\nno resentment and didn\u2019t tell his parents about it.\n\nThough severe in class, Orwell could be quite genial outside the schoolroom\nwith boys who shared his interests. He gave Stevens sixpence, which seemed a\nlot of money at the time, for spotting a spelling mistake on a sign. On\nnatural history outings to the marshes, he taught the boys to stir up methane\nwith a stick and hold a bottle upside down to catch the gas. They lit it and\nit burned like a candle.\n\nSeveral boys had dramatic talent and inspired Orwell\u2019s short play, \u201cKing\nCharles II\u201d, which divided the class into Cavaliers and Roundheads. The 1932\nChristmas play lasted half an hour and had only two performances. Most\nteachers in Orwell\u2019s poorly paid and overworked position would have used a\npublished play instead of writing a new one. But he took enormous trouble\nduring the fall term with the costumes, props and sets, and seemed to enjoy\nthe elaborate preparations.\n\nWriting to his girlfriend in 1932, Orwell (despite five years in Burma) called\nHayes \u201cone of the most godforsaken places I have ever struck.\u201d He also\ncomplained that the work was extremely demanding: \u201cI am living in a sort of\nnightmare\u2014schoolwork, rehearsing boys for their parts in the play, making\ncostumes & playing football. I don\u2019t find the work uninteresting, but it is\nvery exhausting.\u201d\n\nThough he desperately wanted time to work on his novel, Burmese Days, he was\nextremely conscientious and, in a terrible school run entirely for profit,\ntried hard to give the boys a decent education. Reviewing a prep school novel\nin May 1940, he wrote that \u201cthese schools, with their money-grubbing\nproprietors and their staffs of underpaid hacks, are responsible for a lot of\nharm that it is usual to blame on the public schools.\u201d\n\nFrom August to December 1933, without taking a summer holiday, Orwell taught\nand lived at a much better school. The coeducational Frays College was located\nin Uxbridge, a few miles northwest of Hayes. It had about 200 students, thirty\nof them boarders, between the ages of five and fifteen. The staff of sixteen\nprepared them for the professions, universities and Civil Service. He taught\nFrench and English, and supervised hockey and cricket after school. In his\nlittle spare time he went fishing, rode his new motorbike (as he had done in\nMandalay) and worked late into the night on his novel. Colleagues remembered\nthat he had an austere temperament, was distant and cool but always friendly\nand courteous.\n\nDespite his delicate health he was quite reckless. In December 1933, while\nriding his motorbike without an overcoat, he got completely soaked in a\nfreezing rainstorm. He caught a severe chill that turned into pneumonia and\nspent two weeks in an Uxbridge hospital. Too weak to continue teaching he was,\nlike Lawrence, permanently released from that dead-end job by illness.\n\nGeoffrey Stevens thought the school (and school play) in Orwell\u2019s A\nClergyman\u2019s Daughter (1935) was exactly like The Hawthorns. In that novel the\nrepellent suburb is filled with \u201clabyrinths of meanly decent streets, all so\nindistinguishably alike\u201d, and the school (like Lawrence\u2019s) is in \u201ca dark-\nlooking, semi-detached house of yellow brick, three storeys high.\u201d Mrs.\nCreevy, Dorothy Hare\u2019s employer in the wretched Ringwood (echoing the disease\nringworm) Academy for Girls, aged fifteen to eighteen, is a grotesque version\nof the tight-fisted, unscrupulous proprietor of The Hawthornes. Mrs. Creevy\ntells Dorothy that she treats the girls according to their parents\u2019 ability to\npay. The good payers were not to be smacked on any account. The medium payers\ncan get smacked or have their ears twisted if they get saucy. She doesn\u2019t care\nwhat Dorothy does to the bad payers\u2014short of a police case.\n\nDorothy has to teach an impossible range of subjects: Latin, French, History,\nGeography, Maths and Literature, as well as composition, spelling, grammar,\nhandwriting and drawing. She inevitably feels like an impostor, and goes to\nwork with secret shrinking and dread. She has no privacy and very little time\nthat she can call her own, but she\u2019s determined to work hard for the school\nand \u201cbe proud of it, and make every effort to turn it from a place of bondage\ninto a place human and decent\u201d.\n\nAt first she tries hard to make the students think for themselves. But the\nparents complain about her innovative methods, also severely discouraged by\nMrs. Creevy, and the children are forced to return to their hated lessons. The\nworst of it, as with Lawrence, are the beatings, when she loses control of\nherself and begins to hit the mutinous ones: \u201cIt seemed to her an unforgivable\nthing to do, to hit a child; but nearly all teachers come to it in the end.\u201d\nThough it is boring and exhausting to teach \u201cthe victims of a dreary swindle\u201d,\nshe is horrified and ashamed to be suddenly dismissed, but also (like Ursula\nin The Rainbow) relieved to escape.\n\nAll four writers followed the same pattern of disappointed expectations. They\nwere inexperienced, mostly unqualified and had no other job possibilities, and\nhad no idea how hard teaching would be. They were required to cover a wide\nrange of subjects for long hours and low pay, and regress to the harsh regimes\nof their childhood. They loathed the snobbish, intellectually stifling\natmosphere and the swindles of the greedy proprietors. Lacking vocation and\nthe right temperament, they became poor teachers who couldn\u2019t control their\nclasses. They got no support from oppressive headmasters and uncongenial\ncolleagues, found it impossible both to discipline and encourage the boys, and\nhated themselves for beating the children. Alienated, lonely and with no time\nto write, they were delighted to escape through incompetence, immorality or\nillness. For many years afterward they had nightmares about being trapped in a\nschool. But they gained valuable experience from their degrading work and used\nit in their satirical fiction.\n\nJeffrey Meyers published James Salter: Pilot, Screenwriter, Novelist in\nFebruary 2024. His Parallel Lives: From Freud and Mann to Arbus and Plath will\nappear on July 3, 2024.
