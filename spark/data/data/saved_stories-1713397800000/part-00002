We have just days to convince the Senate NOT\nto pass a \u201cterrifying\u201d law (@RonWyden) that will force U.S. businesses to\nserve as NSA spies. CALL YOUR SENATOR NOW using this call tool (click below or\ncall 202-899-8938). 1/25 act.demandprogress.org/call/no-on-sec... ^\n\nCall Your Senators Now - Tell them to block the \"Everyone is a spy\"\nsurveillance bill Call your Senators right now and urge them to block the\n\"Everyone is a spy\" provision in the surveillance bill that just passed the\nHouse. Dial this phone number: 202-899-8938 We\u2019ll connect you to you...\nhttps://act.demandprogress.org/call/no-on-section-702-call-page/\n\nBuried in the Section 702 reauthorization bill (RISAA) passed by the House on\nFriday is the biggest expansion of domestic surveillance since the Patriot\nAct. Senator Wyden calls this power \u201cterrifying,\u201d and he\u2019s right. 2/25\n\n> https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1778864936573100445\n\n^\n\nI\u2019ll explain how this new power works. Under current law, the government can\ncompel \u201celectronic communications service providers\u201d that have direct access\nto communications to assist the NSA in conducting Section 702 surveillance.\n3/25 ^\n\nIn practice, that means companies like Verizon and Google must turn over the\ncommunications of the targets of Section 702 surveillance. (The targets must\nbe foreigners overseas, although the communications can\u2014and do\u2014include\ncommunications with Americans.) 4/25 ^\n\nThrough a seemingly innocuous change to the definition of \u201celectronic\ncommunications surveillance provider,\u201d an amendment offered by House intel\ncommittee (HPSCI) leaders and passed by the House vastly expands the universe\nof entities that can be compelled to assist the NSA. 5/25 ^\n\nIf the bill becomes law, any company or individual that provides ANY service\nwhatsoever may be forced to assist in NSA surveillance, as long as they have\naccess to equipment on which communications are transmitted or stored\u2014such as\nrouters, servers, cell towers, etc. 6/25 ^\n\nThat sweeps in an enormous range of U.S. businesses that provide wifi to their\ncustomers and therefore have access to equipment on which communications\ntransit. Barber shops, laundromats, fitness centers, hardware stores,\ndentist\u2019s offices... the list goes on and on. 7/25 ^\n\nIt also includes commercial landlords that rent out the office space where\ntens of millions of Americans go to work every day\u2014offices of journalists,\nlawyers, nonprofits, financial advisors, health care providers, and more. 8/25\n^\n\nWhen the amendment was first unveiled, one of the FISA Court amici took the\nhighly unusual step of sounding a public alarm. Civil liberties advocates\nnoted that the provision would encompass hotels, libraries, and coffee shops.\n9/25 zwillgen.com/law-enforcemen... ^\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee FISA \u201cReform\u201d Bill Would Greatly Expand the Class\nof Businesses and Other Entities Required to Assist in FISA 702 Surveillance\nYesterday the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence unanimously\napproved the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023 (FRRA), which would\nreauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intellige...\nhttps://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/fisa-reform-bill-702-surveillance/\n\nThe version HPSCI leaders offered Friday therefore exempts... hotels, library\nshops, and coffee shops, plus a handful of other establishments. But as the\nFISA Court amicus promptly pointed out, the vast majority of U.S. businesses\nremain fair game. 10/25 zwillgen.com/law-enforcemen... ^\n\nFISA 702 Reauthorization Amendments: The Second Time is Not the Charm In\nDecember 2023, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPCSI)\nunsuccessfully tried to expand the government\u2019s authority under FISA 702 by\npermitting it to compel a broader swath of U.... https://www.zwillgen.com/law-\nenforcement/fisa-702-reauthorization-amendments-second-time-not-charm/\n\nThe amendment even extends to service providers who come into our homes. House\ncleaners, plumbers, people performing repairs, and IT services providers have\naccess to laptops and routers inside our homes and could be forced to serve as\nsurrogate spies. 11/25 ^\n\nNone of these people or businesses would be allowed to tell anyone about the\nassistance they were compelled to provide. They would be under a gag order,\nand they would face heavy penalties if they failed to comply with it. 12/25 ^\n\nThat\u2019s not even the worst part. Unlike Google and Verizon, most of these\nbusinesses and individuals lack the ability to isolate and turn over a\ntarget\u2019s communications. So they would be required to give the NSA access to\nthe equipment itself... 13/25 ^\n\n...or to use techniques or devices (presumably provided by the NSA) to copy\nand turn over entire communications streams and/or repositories of stored\ncommunications, which would inevitably include vast quantities of wholly\ndomestic communications. 14/25 ^\n\nThe NSA, having wholesale access to domestic communications on an\nunprecedented scale, would then be on the \u201chonor system\u201d to pull out and\nretain only the communications of approved foreign targets. (Let that sink\nin.) 15/25 ^\n\nHPSCI leaders deny that the administration has any intent to use this\nprovision so broadly. Supposedly, there is a single type of service provider\nthat the government wants to rope in. But they didn\u2019t want anyone to know what\nthat service provider was... 16/25 ^\n\n...so they hid the real goal by writing the amendment as broadly and vaguely\nas possible. But no worries, Americans! The administration isn\u2019t actually\ngoing to USE all the power it just persuaded the House to give it. 17/25 ^\n\nI cannot overstate how mindblowingly irresponsible that is. I don\u2019t think\n*any* administration should be trusted with an Orwellian power like this one.\nBut even if *this* administration doesn\u2019t plan to make full use of it... (Go\nahead and fill in the blank.) 18/25 ^\n\nThere are certain powers a government should not have in a democracy. The\nability to force ordinary businesses and individuals to serve as surrogate\nspies is one of them. Even if the targets are supposed to be foreigners, a\npower this sweeping WILL be abused. 19/25 ^\n\nBy the way, when a privacy advocate tried to get @jahimes to engage on this\nissue, here is the thoughtful and conscientious reply given by the ranking\nmember of HPSCI, a man who clearly cares deeply about civil liberties. 20/25\n\n> https://twitter.com/jahimes/status/1779589040733384862\n\n^\n\nThe Senate MUST stop this train before it is too late. The Senate is scheduled\nto vote on the House-passed bill this week. If there\u2019s an opportunity to\nremove this provision, senators should remove it. If not, they should vote\nagainst the bill. 21/25 ^\n\nThe White House will tell senators they have no choice other than to pass the\nHouse bill, because Section 702 expires on April 19, and trying to fix the\nHouse bill\u2014or pass different legislation\u2014would take too long. But the April 19\ndeadline exists only on paper. 22/25 ^\n\nThe administration has already obtained FISA Court approval to continue\nSection 702 surveillance until April 2025. According to the administration\nitself, that approval \u201cgrandfathers\u201d surveillance for a full year, even if\nSection 702 expires. 23/25 news.bgov.com/bloomberg-gove... ^\n\nFISA Court Approves One-Year Extension of Surveillance Power The Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court on Friday approved a one-year extension to a\ncontroversial spy law that permits US intelligence agencies and law\nenforcement to collect the communications o...\nhttps://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/fisa-court-approves-one-year-\nextension-of-surveillance-power\n\nA notional deadline is no reason to create a surveillance state.

Call this number (202-899-8938) ASAP to\nbe connected to your Senators and urge them NOT to pass RISAA, which contains\na \u201cterrifying\u201d provision (@RonWyden) that will force U.S. businesses to serve\nas NSA spies. 1/12\n\nFor more background on this provision, see my tweet thread from yesterday.

This puts Section 702 itself in\njeopardy\u2014something that could easily have been avoided if surveillance hawks\nwere willing to entertain reasonable reforms. 1/17\n\nThe purpose of 702 is to collect intelligence on non-U.S. persons abroad; that\nis where its value overwhelmingly lies. But the gov\u2019t uses it to spy on\nAmericans through \u201cbackdoor searches,\u201d a practice that undermines the 4th\nAmendment and has scant national security value. 2/17\n\nLawmakers on the right and left have proposed reasonable reforms to protect\nAmericans\u2019 privacy, including a warrant requirement for backdoor searches that\nincludes multiple exceptions and wouldn\u2019t apply to metadata queries. 3/17\n\nRead 17 tweets\n\n#### Elizabeth Goitein\n\n@LizaGoitein\n\nApr 9\n\nBuried in the Section 702 reauthorization bill that the House will consider\nthis week (RISAA) is a provision that could result in the *permanent*\nreauthorization of this deeply-flawed authority\u2014without a single reform. 1/11\n\nHere\u2019s how. FISA currently includes a sunset date of April 19 for all of Title\nVII of FISA. Title VII includes Section 702, but it also includes other\nprovisions (Sections 703, 704, and 705) that contain vital protections for\nAmericans located outside the United States. 2/11\n\nRISAA\u2019s sunset provision includes two parts. The first changes FISA\u2019s sunset\ndate for Title VII to five years from the date of RISAA\u2019s enactment. If RISAA\nwere enacted and signed into law on April 19, the sunset date for Title VII\nwould be April 19, 2029. So far, so good. 3/11\n\nRead 11 tweets\n\n#### Elizabeth Goitein\n\n@LizaGoitein\n\nApr 8\n\n.@SpeakerJohnson has caved to the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s bush league\ntactics and will block votes on a key reform when Section 702 reauthorization\ngoes to the House floor this week. 1/12 politico.com/newsletters/pl...\n\nThe base bill that the House will consider\u2014the Reforming Intelligence and\nSecuring America Act (RISAA)\u2014contains no meaningful reforms.
