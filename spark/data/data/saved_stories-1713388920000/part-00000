The global digital transformation market\nsize was valued at $320 billion, and set for 18% annual growth, to reach a\nprojected $695 billion by 2025.\n\nThe global pandemic lockdowns then put a jet engine on the bullet train. More\nthan two-thirds of boards accelerated digital business initiatives because of\nCOVID . 63% of leaders said the pandemic prompted them to embrace digital\ntransformation sooner than originally planned. Research from IBM found that\nfor 93% of businesses, COVID accelerated their digital transformation by an\naverage of 5.3 years .\n\nThe world had barely drawn breath from this impact when artificial\nintelligence (AI) went mainstream, creating a market potentially able to\nsustain annual growth in excess of 40% to reach $1.3 trillion by 2033 . And\nthat was on top of a global Internet of Things (IoT) sector well on its way to\nan estimated $336bn .\n\nAgainst the backdrop of these relentless forces, businesses have scrambled for\ninfrastructure resources. It is hardly surprising that the global public cloud\ncomputing market is estimated to reach $679bn in 2024.\n\nA new context\n\nBut the economic outlook has shifted. Even amidst the incredible growth of AI\nand rapidly maturing IoT use cases, organisations have reconsidered their\napproach. As the threats of recession loom, businesses have re-prioritised\nprofitability.\n\nThe subsequent investigations into infrastructure have exposed hidden risks \u2013\nand costs. The incredible urgency caused by digital transformation, COVID and\nAI, led to poor procurement decisions. The lessons of avoiding vendor lock-in\n\u2013 learnt so painfully around issues such as Y2K - were forgotten.\n\nBusinesses now face the consequences of these \u2018all-in\u2019 pushes to the public\ncloud or fully on-premise data centres.\n\nBeing locked into public cloud can expose a business to costs around excessive\nconsumption, expensive and scarce management talent, data egress and increased\nsecurity.\n\nBy comparison, the recent years have been an abject lesson that unpredictable\nenergy prices, difficulties in scaling and increased costs of security can\nthreaten the returns of a proprietary data centre.\n\nColocation resurgent\n\nIt is these sobering realisations that have led to an increased interest in\ncolocation. Businesses want to combine the flexibility and scalability from\ncloud, with the cost control of owned infrastructure. This has been summarised\nas \u2018putting the right workload in the right place\u2019.\n\nTypically, this is now driven by a need for increased efficiency to improve\nprofitability. The warnings of Gartner to beware of cloud washing and aim for\na \u2018cloud-smart\u2019, as opposed to \u2018cloud-first\u2019 approach , have been embraced in\nthis new context.\n\nTo be cloud-smart, businesses need infrastructure partners that can offer\ncomprehensive options to enable them to run lean, resilient IT operations. It\nis no longer about just space and power in a colocation data centre \u2013\nespecially in an age of AI workloads that will push hardware to its limits.\n\nThe imperative is enabling customers to focus on their core business, not just\nIT management. Colocation success is about strategic business capabilities\nbeing developed. This begins even before stepping inside a datacentre. It\nstarts where that facility is located.\n\nOne of the crucial issues with centralised, hyperscale cloud facilities has\nbeen that businesses do not have control and access to their technology.\nRegional data centres, such as our twelve locations across the UK, put\nbusinesses closer to their data.\n\nThis not only means better control \u2013 it improves performance and reduces\nsupport costs, especially in the event of maintenance or unexpected downtime.\n\nThe benefits of partnership\n\nTo then go one step further, a colocation partner will not only minimise\ndisruption or outage, but also ensure that assets perform at their optimal\nlevel. Resilience and performance are not the same thing, and a true partner\nrecognises how both impact profitability.\n\nTo improve return, a colocation partner \u2013 as opposed to provider \u2013 will offer\nmanaged services. The most compelling rationale for any form of outsourcing is\nto enable a business to offload non-critical tasks. Digital infrastructure is\nno different.\n\nThere is little return for a business to manage its own hardware installation,\nmaintenance, security updates, performance optimization, monitoring or\ntroubleshooting.\n\nBy comparison, freeing IT teams to focus strategic improvement is at the heart\nof achieving a return on digital transformation investment. Though it is\ndifficult to offer a consistent figure to quantify this, research suggests\nthat successful deployment of managed services can increase operational\nefficiency by 45-65% .\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter periods of innovation and adaptation, the pendulum has swung back and\nthe goal for businesses in 2024 is profitability. Organisations once again\nneed to focus on how to optimize infrastructure costs. In this respect,\ncolocation provides the best of both worlds \u2013 cloud versatility and\nscalability, whilst maintaining on-premise control.\n\nBut providers must expand their focus and deliver more than space and power.\nThey need to offer comprehensive solutions to help enterprises build\nresilient, lean foundations that drive the bottom line. Likewise, businesses\nlooking to explore colocation need to integrate it into a comprehensive\ninfrastructure designed to control cost and deliver substantial return.\n\n##### Interested in more insights on the future of colocation?\n\n##### Subscribe for updates and stay tuned for the next article.\n\nGet in touch\n\nBack to resources\n\nSubscribe and stay updated\n\n  * Follow Us\n\n  * What we do\n\n    * Cloud\n    * Colocation\n    * Connectivity\n    * Services\n\n  * Who we are\n\n    * Contact\n    * Careers\n    * Meet the Team\n    * Blog\n    * Accreditations\n    * Ecosystem\n\n  * Legal Information\n\n    * Terms and Conditions\n    * Cookie and Privacy Policy\n    * Modern Slavery Statement\n    * Corporate Governance and Sustainability\n    * Gender Pay Gap\n\n  * Useful Links\n\n    * My Pulsant\n    * Amito Portal\n  * Sitemap\n\n  * Follow Us\n\n\u00a9 Pulsant 2024\n\n", "frontpage": false}
