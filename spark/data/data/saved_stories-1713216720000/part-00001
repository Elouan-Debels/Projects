While the industry is not\ncompletely out of the woods, as macroeconomic challenges remain in many\nmarkets, this marks the third consecutive quarter of shipment growth, a strong\nindicator that a recovery is well underway.\n\n\"As expected, smartphone recovery continues to move forward with market\noptimism slowly building among the top brands,\" said Ryan Reith, group vice\npresident with IDC's Worldwide Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers. \"While\nApple managed to capture the top spot at the end of 2023, Samsung successfully\nreasserted itself as the leading smartphone provider in the first quarter.\nWhile IDC expects these two companies to maintain their hold on the high end\nof the market, the resurgence of Huawei in China, as well as notable gains\nfrom Xiaomi, Transsion, OPPO/OnePlus, and vivo will likely have both OEMs\nlooking for areas to expand and diversify. As the recovery progresses, we're\nlikely to see the top companies gain share as the smaller brands struggle for\npositioning.\"\n\n\"The smartphone market is emerging from the turbulence of the last two years\nboth stronger and changed,\" said Nabila Popal, research director with IDC's\nWorldwide Tracker team. \"Firstly, we continue to see growth in value and\naverage selling prices (ASPs) as consumers opt for more expensive devices\nknowing they will hold onto their devices longer. Secondly, there is a shift\nin power among the Top 5 companies, which will likely continue as market\nplayers adjust their strategies in a post-recovery world. Xiaomi is coming\nback strong from the large declines experienced over the past two years and\nTranssion is becoming a stable presence in the Top 5 with aggressive growth in\ninternational markets. In contrast, while the Top 2 players both saw negative\ngrowth in the first quarter, it seems Samsung is in a stronger position\noverall than they were in recent quarters.\"\n\nTop 5 Companies, Worldwide Smartphone Shipments, Market Share, and Year-Over-\nYear Growth, Q1 2024 (Preliminary results, shipments in millions of units)  \n---  \nCompany| 1Q24 Shipments| 1Q24 Market Share| 1Q23 Shipments| 1Q23 Market Share|\nYear-Over-Year Change  \n1\\.
