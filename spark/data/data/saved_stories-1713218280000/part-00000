The\noverall completion rate is probably lower.\n\nThat 1-2% of people, to be clear, are AWESOME. They are self-starters, systems\nthinkers. They will all be VPs of something in 10 years. And they come from\nevery conceivable background from all over the world - stay-at-home single\nmoms, plumbers, poker players, retail workers and dentists and delivery\ndrivers and loggers (the lumberjack kind) and architects (the skyscraper kind)\nand engineers (the mining kind) and teachers and help deskers and 17-year-old\nhigh school dropouts. Outside of existing IT experience, there is no obvious\nbackground that predicts who is going to do well on this project.\n\nAnd yet, overall, only about 1% of them do.\n\nFor a long time I was convinced that this was an enablement failure on my\npart. And it may well be. So I tried a bunch of things to give people better\ntools for completing the Cloud Resume Challenge. I wrote a guidebook. I wrote\nthree guidebooks. I started a Discord server (it\u2019s past 10,000 members now!)\nAnd last year, I started doing free monthly sprints, each with a cohort\nbetween 100 and 200 people.\n\nThe sprints included live office hours, weekly pace emails, community support,\nand as much additional help and guidance as I could figure out how to give\nwithout actually doing people\u2019s work for them.\n\nAnd the challenge completion rate for sprinters went all the way up to ....\n2.4 percent. The rest just dropped out and ghosted us.\n\nAgain, those 2.4% of people are AWESOME. They are proactive communicators and\nthey know how to learn. They will all be CTOs in 10 years. But ... 2.4%? Out\nof 100 people who signed up and introduced themselves and planned out a month\nto do this in the company of other highly motivated individuals, 2 or 3 will\nfinish the project?\n\nWhat is going on here?\n\nNow, in fairness, if all that mattered was increasing that completion rate,\nthere are several things I could do.\n\n  1. I could promise rewards if you complete the project - for example, by referring champions to hiring managers in my personal network. I used to do this a bit, way back in the early days of the challenge, and still do it when I can, but it doesn\u2019t scale.\n\n  2. I could create negative incentives for not completing the project - for example, charging a painful-ish fee to join the sprint that is refunded when you submit your project for code review. But I don\u2019t want to put economic blockers in the way of people getting started on learning. Many sprinters are from developing countries and / or financially strapped as it is.\n\nEither way, strengthening the extrinsic incentives for people to complete the\nproject also increases the likelihood that they will take shortcuts, like\ncopying someone else\u2019s work, instead of really engaging with the learning on\ntheir own. And this would do much, much more harm than good.\n\nBut what most people ask for is that I make the project easier to complete -\npreferably by creating a video course that shows you exactly what code to type\nand what buttons to click in step-by-step order.\n\nI am fairly confident that if I recorded such a course, three things would\nhappen:\n\n  1. I could sell the course and make quite a bit of money.\n\n  2. The completion rate for the Cloud Resume Challenge would shoot up - maybe even past 50%!\n\n  3. The value of the challenge as a means of surfacing people who will make great cloud engineers would plummet, maybe even down close to zero. Noise would overwhelm the signal.\n\nSo the project stays challenging, and the completion rate hovers stubbornly in\nthe single digits.\n\nAnd intellectually that seems reasonable, but emotionally it bothers me a lot.\nBecause isn\u2019t that the textbook definition of gatekeeping? By creating and\npromoting a project so challenging that it turns off most of the beginners who\nattempt it, haven\u2019t I thrown up unnecessary barriers in front of all kinds of\npeople who may need more enablement, more support, more guidance, to succeed?\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible. But I\u2019m not sure what to do about it.\n\nI mean, the world is full of bootcamps and video courses and certifications\nthat promise to hold your hand and spoon-feed you information and give you a\nstep-by-step roadmap to the tech job of your dreams. That is not gatekeeping.\nBut it also, in so many cases, doesn\u2019t work.\n\nLook, we are currently in the toughest job market for junior software\nengineers that I\u2019ve personally seen. Maybe the toughest since the dot-com\nbust. It would be nice if we lived in a world where hiring managers were\npatient and trusting and ready to hold your hand. But we do not. We live in a\nworld where hiring managers are fighting for every scrap of headcount they\nhave. If I pretend that a hard thing (getting good enough at cloud that you\nbuild some relationships and create professional opportunities for yourself)\nis an easy thing (watch these videos, copy-and-paste your way through these\ntutorials), I will not sleep well.\n\nIs there such a thing as good gatekeeping?\n\nI am interested in your thoughts.\n\n##\n\nQuick followup on OSS drama\n\nThanks to all of you who had kind words to say about last week\u2019s summary of\nthe drama engulfing the open-source / \u201csource-available\u201d software world.\n\nQuick recap: there is an open-source fork of Terraform called OpenTofu, Matt\nAsay published an article in InfoWorld accusing them of stealing Terraform\u2019s\nsource code for a new feature, Hashicorp followed up with a cease-and-desist\nletter, and it was all very nasty and petty.\n\nAt the end of that article I suggested three possibilities for how the drama\ncould play out. It brings me great joy to say that what happened was precisely\nmy Possibility A: OpenTofu released an outstanding source code origination\ndocument demonstrating how both Hashicorp and OpenTofu had derived their new\ncode from existing MPL-licensed work in the codebase. Seriously, read that\nwriteup. The technical details are one thing; what\u2018s truly remarkable is the\nexplanation of how OpenTofu runs their project to make sure that every line of\ncode they commit is legally unimpeachable as well. That document taught me a\nlot about what great OSS governance looks like.\n\nThey also released a redacted version of Hashicorp\u2019s C&D letter, and I must\nsay it\u2019s a bit too convenient that Hashicorp sent that letter listing EXACTLY\nthe same trumped-up concerns as the InfoWorld article, at more or less the\nexact same time as the article went live. It looks rather like Hashicorp\u2019s\nlawyers fed the allegations to Matt Asay. So, as I hoped in my Possibility A,\nI\u2019m also glad to see that Matt had the integrity to acknowledge his mistake\nand disclaim his article.\n\nIt may, of course, be possible that Hashicorp has won a larger victory by\nspewing FUD into the open-source ecosystem. But I\u2019m heartened by a parallel\nevent: the community\u2019s outraged response to Redis, Ltd\u2019s source-available\nrelicensing and subsequent rebranding of Redis. Keep in mind that Redis, Ltd,\nthe company, aren\u2019t even the original creators of Redis, the project; they\nsort of annexed it like Alsace-Lorraine and are now acting like it\u2019s their\ndivine right to license it as they please. As long as the open-source\ncommunity maintains the vindictive energy to back alternatives like Valkey, I\nthink OSS is going to be just fine.\n\n##\n\nCartoon of the day\n\nThis one made sense in my head.\n\n### Subscribe to Good Tech Things\n\nBy Forrest Brazeal \u00b7 Launched 5 years ago\n\nCloud and tech commentary from Forrest Brazeal\n\n1 Like\n\n1\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Is there such a thing as good gatekeeping?\n\nnewsletter.goodtechthings.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nPlease fix the AWS Free Tier before somebody gets hurt\n\nLet engineers learn cloud without jeopardizing their personal well-being.\n\nMay 4, 2021 \u2022\n\nForrest Brazeal\n\n10\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Please fix the AWS Free Tier before somebody gets hurt\n\nnewsletter.goodtechthings.com\n\n34\n\nWait, is cloud bad?\n\nI regret to inform you that there is discourse\n\nOct 24, 2023 \u2022\n\nForrest Brazeal\n\n51\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Wait, is cloud bad?\n\nnewsletter.goodtechthings.com\n\n4\n\nThe greatest resume I've ever seen\n\nHe had zero cloud experience ... or did he?\n\nSep 30, 2021 \u2022\n\nForrest Brazeal\n\n8\n\nShare this post\n\n#### The greatest resume I've ever seen\n\nnewsletter.goodtechthings.com\n\n2\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Forrest Brazeal\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great culture\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
