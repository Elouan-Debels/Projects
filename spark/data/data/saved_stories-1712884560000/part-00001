My favourite object, without a\ndoubt, is this device that was used to resuscitate canaries in coal mines, and\nI\u2019m going to tell you why.\n\nCage for reviving canary, with oxygen cylinder, made by Siebe Gorman & Co.\nLtd, London. View object in our online collection.\n\nFirst, a little background history. Canaries were used in mines from the late\n1800s to detect gases, such as carbon monoxide. The gas is deadly to humans\nand canaries alike in large quantities, but canaries are much more sensitive\nto small amounts of the gas, and so will react more quickly than humans.\n\nThis was discovered by John Haldane, who was asked to help determine the cause\nof an explosion at Tylorstown Colliery in 1896. He concluded the explosion was\ncaused by a build-up of carbon monoxide and set out to find a way of detecting\nthe odourless gas before it could harm humans. The result was this cage and\nits captive canary.\n\nThe circular door would be kept open and had a grill to prevent the canary\nescaping. Once the canary showed signs of carbon monoxide poisoning the door\nwould be closed and a valve opened, allowing oxygen from the tank on top to be\nreleased and revive the canary. The miners would then be expected to evacuate\nthe danger area.\n\nSo why is this my favourite object in our collections? Firstly, while I don\u2019t\nadvocate the use of animals in testing dangerous conditions, I am pleased that\nHaldane spared a thought for the canaries themselves and worked to make their\njob as non-lethal as possible. My impression from hearing about canaries in\ncoal mines was that they were expected to die to warn people, so when I came\nacross this object it was a huge relief (though my research on the topic has\nfound less thoughtful cages).\n\nI\u2019ve even read that many miners cared deeply for their canary companions, and\nsome disliked the advent of electronic sensors in the mid-1980s because it\nmeant they would lose this companionship. Personally, I\u2019m pleased that this\npractice has come to an end.\n\nAnother reason this is my favourite object is because it isn\u2019t pristine. It\u2019s\nscuffed and has clear signs of wear from use. This may sound strange, but when\nit comes to museum objects we often prefer the ones that are a little beaten\nup. They add more context and show how the object may have been used. We are\nable to research and understand much more from a used example than a pristine\none.\n\nFor instance, here is another canary cage down at our sister site, the Science\nMuseum:\n\nScience Museum Group \u00a9 The Board of Trustees of the Science Museum\n\nIt looks great, and the canary is definitely more life-like, but in museums\nlike ours we love an object that can tell a story. I\u2019d rather work with one\nthat looks like it\u2019s seen some action, and I\u2019m not alone in this opinion.\n\nOur museum aims to tell the history of innovation relating to science and\nindustrialisation, and we often show that this history isn\u2019t a clean one. We\nhave objects that are dirty or damaged, or perhaps represent difficult topics,\nand I personally wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. If we were to scrub away the\ndirt, or hide the dark spots, then the histories we tell wouldn\u2019t be true.\n\nSo, my favourite object is a mucky and damaged box, in which a canary would\nhave been caged, and used as an indicator of dangerous conditions. It\u2019s not\npretty, and it\u2019s cruel to the animal, but it is representative of an\ninnovation in mining practices, and our understanding of gases and bird\nphysiology. It lets us tell interesting histories, and it\u2019s a great example of\nhow scientific understanding leads to changes in industrial practices, which\nis one of our major themes at this museum.\n\nBefore I go, here are some honourable mentions from our wider collections here\nat MSI that I have a great fondness for:\n\nOur many unusual light-bulbs, for reasons you can see here:\n\nScience Museum Group \u00a9 The Board of Trustees of the Science Museum\n\nOur Cyberman costume, AKA Bob:\n\nScience Museum Group \u00a9 The Board of Trustees of the Science Museum\n\nAnd our sample of Apollo spacesuit fabric, just like the ones Neil Armstrong\nand Buzz Aldrin wore while walking on the moon. You can read more about\nManchester\u2019s role in putting humans on the moon in my post here:\n\nScience Museum Group \u00a9 The Board of Trustees of the Science Museum\n\nIf you\u2019d like to find out more about any of these objects, or come to the\nmuseum to research them then you can browse our collections online at\nhttp://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/ or email\ncollections@scienceandindustrymuseum.org.uk.\n\n### Lewis Pollard\n\nLewis Pollard is Curator of Television and Broadcast at our sister museum, the\nNational Science and Media Museum in Bradford.\n\nLewis has written 9 posts\n\nCategorised\n\n    Collections, At the museum\n\nTagged\n\n    Animals, Local history\n\n## 17 comments on \u201cExploring our collection: the canary resuscitator\u201d\n\n  1.

They weren\u2019t only used in mines and potentially the\niron/steelmaking process generated more \u2018free\u2019 Carbon Monoxide than would be\nfound down a mine hence the need for early warning for the workforce. I also\nhave a report that shows the expected effects of CO on a person and a canary.\nAt relatively low levels (not by todays standard) the canary would show no\nexposure symptoms but the person could collapse & die. The old canary house\nwas still in use (though sadly no longer for canaries) until 2015.\n\nReply\n\n  3. Alan Morriss says:\n\n15 August 2018 at 11.11\n\nGreat blog Lewis. Nice to know they cared enough to try and resuscitate them.\nNever seen one before. Box that is, not canaries.\n\nReply\n\n    1.

Alan Kemp says:\n\n22 April 2021 at 08.49\n\nReally nice collection of items- I could look at these things all day!\n\nOn the coal mine explosion though- could it really have been caused by carbon\nmonoxide?\n\nReply\n\n    1. Philip Day says:\n\n28 October 2022 at 09.10\n\nCarbon Monoxide could certainly have caused the explosion, but it\u2019s more\nlikely to have been present following an explosion caused by the combustion of\nmethane.\n\nBack in the days of \u2018Coal Gas\u2019, the production of gas in gasworks included\n\u2018water gas\u2019 where steam was passed over hot coke, and the resulting gas\nconsisted of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, both of which would be very happy\nto cause an explosion if the proportions were suitable. coal Gas was also very\neffective in supporting coal gas poisoning.\n\nWe also had methane in coal mines. Of these, carbon monoxide is by far the\ndeadliest, due to its affinity for haemoglobin, and the canary was a very\nsensitive gas detector.\n\nReply\n\n    2. Michael Wascher says:\n\n2 January 2023 at 00.03\n\nYes \u2013 it has carbon & oxygen, fuel & oxidizer.\n\nWe usually hear of its effects on the human body. There it causes harm because\nit is a better oxidizer than molecular oxygen. It binds to hemoglobin\npreferentially. However the cells can\u2019t use CO, so are starved of oxygen &\neventually die.\n\nReply\n\n      1. Peter says:\n\n7 September 2023 at 18.59\n\nYou\u2019re right about the effects on the body, but carbon monoxide is not\nexplosive or flammable. The components of carbon monoxide have already reacted\nand bonded and become stable; in this form the energy produced by the reaction\nof carbon and oxygen has been expended and energy would have to be put in to\nseparate them into their reactive forms again.\n\nReply\n\n  6.

M says:\n\n15 May 2023 at 11.05\n\nVisited Manchester last year around Christmas and it\u2019s an absolutely amazing\ncity in terms of history, industrial impact and its current diversity and\nactivism. I\u2019m quite surprised I don\u2019t recall this particular exhibit but I\nloved your museum, particularly the Music exhibition. I even carry a flattened\ncoin with me in my wallet now as a memento.\n\nBut having now read this article, my otherwise gloomy day has just become that\nlittle bit better, as I\u2019d always imagined the relationship between miners and\ncanaries to be much more... single-sided. Yes, even though it was still what\nwe\u2019d nowadays call animal abuse.\n\nWe\u2019ve also visited the People\u2019s History Museum and I think it complements the\ncity\u2019s industrial story perfectly, highlighting the human struggle for self-\nbetterment in face of our relentless search for efficiency.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to coming back there (genuinely, as we have close friends\nliving halfway between Manchester and Liverpool).\n\nGreetings from a Romanian living in the Czech Republic.\n\nReply\n\n  13. catherinemallory says:\n\n9 September 2023 at 05.36\n\nFascinating.
