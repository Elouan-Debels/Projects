(Credit: Emmanuel Lafont)\n\nThe grand metropolises of 21st Century civilisation will leave a geological\nlegacy that will last for millennia, but as the author David Farrier writes,\nsome things will endure far longer than others.\n\nIt seemed as though the whole world had been buried in concrete. Perhaps it\nwas jetlag, but the view was dizzying: the city, pouring away to the horizon\nin every direction. Shanghai is one of the world\u2019s largest metropolises. From\nthe viewing platform of the Shanghai Tower, the second tallest building in the\nworld, it looked endless \u2013 a wave of skyscrapers rippling outwards, fading to\na blue blur of residential blocks in the far distance.\n\nThe modern cityscape is as much geological as it is urban. If Shanghai is a\nconcrete desert, New York is the original canyon city, its skyscraper-lined\nstreets forming deep valleys of the kind that, in the past, only great rivers\ncould create over thousands of years. In a late essay, Virginia Woolf pictured\nherself swooping like a bird over the Hudson estuary, past Staten Island and\nthe Statue of Liberty to the concrete chasms of Manhattan. \"The City of New\nYork, over which I am hovering,\" she wrote in 1938, \"looks as if it had been\nscraped and scrubbed only the night before. It has no houses. It is made of\nimmensely high towers, each pierced by a million holes.\"\n\nThe first cities replicated the environments that once-nomadic people depended\non, concentrating shelter and sustenance in one place. The metropolis of the\npresent offers its inhabitants the whole planet in microcosm. As the author\nGaia Vince writes, the buildings and infrastructure of the urban landscape\nsimulate \"the high view of mountains, the protection of dry caves, the fresh\nwater of lakes and rivers\".\n\nIf cities have a geological character, it begs the question of what they will\nleave behind in the stratigraphy of the 21st Century. Fossils are a kind of\nplanetary memory of the shapes the world once wore. Just as the landscapes of\nthe deep past are not forgotten, how will the rock record of the deep future\nremember Shanghai, New York and other great cities?\n\nYou may also like:\n\n  * The guards caring for Chernobyl's abandoned dogs\n  * How to reboot civilisation\n  * How to build something that lasts 10,000 years\n\nYou might assume that cities are too ephemeral to leave behind a fossil. \"Most\nbuildings are designed to last for 60 years,\" says Roma Agrawal, structural\nengineer for the Shard skyscraper in London. \"And I always thought, that feels\nreally short, because that\u2019s my lifetime.\" If you wanted to build something\nthat would stand in tens of thousands of years, \"then the forces that you need\nto contend with become huge\", she explains. Most engineers don't look that far\nahead.\n\nEmmanuel Lafont\n\nWith skyscrapers at its core, Shanghai's concrete desert stretches to the\nhorizon (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont)\n\nBut while a building might not be designed to stand tall for millennia, that\ndoes not mean it will lack a geological legacy. According to Jan Zalasiewicz,\nemeritus professor of palaeobiology at the University of Leicester, it is \"a\nquite reasonable, even prosaic, geological prediction\" that a megacity will\nleave a fossil. I asked him how he could be so certain. \"As a geologist, you\u2019d\nalmost put the question the other way around,\" he replied. \"How can you\nprevent this?\"\n\nIt\u2019s a matter, he says, of durability, abundance, and location. The main\ncomponents of a modern city have their origins in geology and are therefore,\nin their different ways, highly durable. The majority of the world\u2019s iron ore\nformed nearly two billion years ago. The sand, gravel, and quartz in concrete\nare among the most resilient substances on Earth. These hard-wearing materials\nonce existed in natural deposits. But where before it was only water, gravity,\nor tectonic activity that moved them, now it\u2019s a combination of human\ninitiative and hydrocarbon fuels.\n\nEvery 100 years, the mining and construction industries move enough rock\naround the planet to create a new mountain range\n\nWe live in the greatest age of city-building the world has ever seen. Three\nhundred years ago, there was only one city with a population of one million\n(Edo, modern-day Tokyo). Today there are more than 500, all of them dwarfed by\nmegacities like Mexico City (population: 21 million), Shanghai (24 million),\nand Tokyo (now 37 million). As I discovered while researching my book\nFootprints: In Search of Future Fossils, the quantities of materials involved\nare staggering. Every 100 years, the mining and construction industries move\nenough rock around the planet to create a new mountain range, 40km wide, 100km\nlong, and 4km high (25 x 62 x 2.5 miles). Enough concrete has been cast since\nWorld War Two to cover the entire planet, land and sea. According to a recent\nstudy in the journal Nature, there is now a greater mass of buildings and\ninfrastructure on the planet (1,100 Gigatonnes) than trees and shrubs (900\nGigatonnes).\n\nLocation matters in determining the kind of fossil a city will leave. In\ngeological terms, land is never static \u2013 either climbing or sinking on a\n\"tectonic elevator\". A city like Manchester in the UK, which is situated on\nground still rising after the last ice age, will erode entirely over time,\nwashing a trail of brick, concrete, and plastic particles out into the Irish\nSea. \"But many of the world\u2019s largest cities are deeply anchored in the mouths\nof deltas and coastal plains,\" says Zalasiewicz. \"And they\u2019re subsiding.\nDeltas sink, that\u2019s what deltas do.\" In many cases, human activity is\nmassively hastening this process. Since 1900, Shanghai has sunk by 2.5m (8ft)\ndue to groundwater extraction and the weight of its buildings pressing into\nmarshy ground. Added to which is sea level rise, which could exceed a metre by\n2100. \"But even without sea level rise,\" says Zalasiewicz, \"it would be\ninexorable, because the subsidence is steady.\"\n\nEmmanuel Lafont\n\nFrom plastic to glass, a city's components are geological in nature, and much\nwill be preserved (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont)\n\nWhat about a particular structure? Shanghai Tower weighs 850,000 tonnes: a\n632m-tall (2,073ft) steel framework with more than 20,000 panes of glass, and\n60,000 cubic metres (2.1 million cubic feet) of concrete. How will it\nfossilise?\n\n\"Let\u2019s say Shanghai will behave as Amsterdam and parts of the Mississippi\ndelta are behaving now, where sediment is pouring in,\" says Zalasiewicz. \"You\nwill get progressive changes over thousands and hundreds of thousands, and\nmillions and then tens of millions of years.\"\n\nLike other wealthy cities, Shanghai will be vigorously defended against sea\nlevel rise, but climate feedback loops mean that the oceans will creep upwards\nfor centuries to come. When the water does become unmanageable, there will\nlikely be a slow abandonment, with the wealthiest leaving first. Poorer\npeople, with nowhere to go, may have to adapt to semi-submerged conditions.\nOver several hundred years, the upper levels of Shanghai Tower will decay as\nwind and water erode them. Perhaps they\u2019ll be weakened, too, by scavengers\nharvesting valuable materials. If the lowest levels have managed to remain\nabove water, only the bottom one or two storeys will remain standing,\nsurrounded by a rubble layer of fallen debris.\n\nThe inevitable inundation may come from the sea, or from the collapse of the\nmassive Three Gorges Dam higher up the Yangtze river. But as it floods, the\nwater will bring vast amounts of mud and sediment that will cover the ground\nfloor and subsurface levels like a wax seal. After 500 years, only a low-lying\nisland would remain where the tower once stood, streaked red by oxidised iron\nleft over from the four immense steel supercolumns that once held it in place.\nThe real story will be below ground.\n\nEmmanuel Lafont\n\nMany human-made objects \u2013 the paraphernalia of a city \u2013 will endure (Credit:\nEmmanuel Lafont)\n\nShanghai Tower has five subsurface levels, including shops and restaurants and\nparking space for 1,800 vehicles. Entombed in thick mud, these spaces will be\npreserved against erosion and begin to fossilise \u2013 \"the Pompeii effect, if you\nlike,\" says Zalasiewicz.\n\nAlmost immediately, water making its way down to the lowest levels it will\nreact with the calcareous material in concrete, to form cathelmites \u2013\nstalactite- and stalagmite-like growths that form in human-made environments.\nThese will continue to grow for thousands of years, transforming the shopping\nmall into something akin to a horror movie set. If humanity is still around,\nmost things of value will have been stripped out before the Tower is\ncompletely abandoned, but perhaps not everything. Aluminium in the ventilation\nsystem, stainless steel in the food court \u2013 maybe even a few cars in the\ngarage levels will be left to perform remarkable transformations.\n\nAt first the car will simply rust but, as iron dissolves well in anoxic water,\nonce the oxygen level decreases its metal components will begin to dissolve.\nOr perhaps a part of the chassis will mineralise, reacting with sulphides to\nform pyrite. The iron in steel beams or embedded in reinforced concrete,\nkitchen implements, or even tiny quantities of iron in the speaker of a mobile\nphone will all acquire a glittering sheen. Even whole rooms \u2013 a food court\nkitchen fitted with stainless steel worktops \u2013 might be transformed into\nfool\u2019s gold.\n\nPlastics, protected from the harsh effects of weathering and UV light, will be\namong the most patient materials. \"No one knows exactly how long they will\nlast,\" says Zalasiewicz, \"but an analogy might be drawn with another long-\nchained polymer.\" If a bug happens to become stuck in some melted plastic\nbefore the Tower is sealed off, it may be preserved like the insect in amber\nin Jurassic Park.\n\nOver time, the plastic will carbonise and become brittle. Sheets of aluminium\nin heating ducts will link up with silicates and slowly change into China\nclay, providing a perfect environment for fossilisation. One hundred thousand\nyears after the tower was abandoned, the clay will have hardened into shale\nstudded with the ghostly impression of plastic knife handles, light switches,\nor the knob of a gear stick.\n\nEmmanuel Lafont\n\nWhat will our descendants make of the glass screens and rare earth metals of\nour smartphones? (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont)\n\nThe story continues even deeper underground. The entire Shanghai Tower sits on\ntop of a concrete raft, one metre thick and covering nearly 9,000 sq m (97,000\nsq ft). Beneath this are 955 concrete-and-steel piles, each a metre in\ndiameter, driven up to 86m (282ft) deep into soft ground. After several\nmillion years, as the weight of the sea water and sediment warps the\nsubterranean layers beyond recognition, some of the foundation piles will\nfracture, twisting within compacting mudrock formations like the fossil roots\nof an immense, long-vanished tree.\n\nAs millions of years stretch into tens of millions, the transformations come\nmore slowly. Rare earth minerals, leached from discarded mobile phones and\nother electronic devices, may begin to form secondary mineral crystals. Glass\nfrom windshields and shop windows will devitrify, darkening just as obsidian\ndoes after long burial. By now, the entire city is compressed to a layer\nperhaps only a few metres thick in the strata. All that is left of Shanghai\nTower is a geological anomaly studded with the fossil outlines of chopsticks,\nchairs, sim cards, and hair clips.\n\nAll of this will be deeply buried, in some cases thousands of metres down. But\ngeology never stands still. After around one hundred million years, as new\nmountain ranges begin to form, the layer of compacted rubble that was once\nShanghai Tower may be pushed upwards, and revealed.\n\nEmmanuel Lafont\n\nOur fossils will tell the story of how we got around (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont)\n\n\"Structures have stories,\" writes Roma Agrawal in her book Built. They tell\nthe stories of the people who lived in them and the world they were made for.\nThe same goes for the remains of Shanghai Tower, even after such so much time\nhas passed. Any future explorers, whether an evolved form of life on this\nplanet or from another world, would be able to recreate a picture of 21st\nCentury life in astonishing detail, provided they can use the same techniques\nthat geologists use today.\n\nFossilised bicycles or rubber boots will indicate we were bipedal, a fossil\nkeyboard will suggest the shape of our hands, and spectacles or hearing aids\nwill disclose how we perceived the world. The outline of a set of dentures, a\nmotorcycle helmet, a wheelchair, a neoprene wetsuit or even a shop mannequin,\nwill recall the contours of our bodies, perhaps even that we were sexually\ndimorphic.\n\nArchaeologically-speaking, clothes have not been very hard-wearing for much of\nhuman history, says Zalasiewicz. \"But as soon as plastic came along, we\nsuddenly have super durable techno-fur, as it were \u2013 detachable techno-fur.\"\n\nIt isn\u2019t just our bodies that will be remembered: our minds will leave a trace\nas well. The scale and complexity of our fossil cities will testify that we\nwere social beings. Perhaps a deep-future geologist might conclude we were a\nhive species like termites, but it\u2019s likely that there will be enough evidence\nof individual invention in the sheer variety of fossil imprints, what\nZalasiewicz calls \"technofossils,\" to suggest otherwise. Moreover, the\ningenuity needed to create something like a mobile phone \u2013 extracting deeply-\nburied hydrocarbons and metals, then transporting them between continents to\nbe manipulated and combined in highly complex assemblages \u2013 will record the\nscale of our invention.\n\nEmmanuel Lafont\n\nWill the animals of the Anthropocene and \"techno-fur\" define our time?\n(Credit: Emmanuel Lafont)\n\nLike the fossilised burrows and tracks left by ancient creatures, our trace\nfossils will show how we moved. But they\u2019ll also record that we didn\u2019t only\ndepend on our own locomotion. There are more than 300km (186 miles) of subway\nline beneath Shanghai. Protected against erosion, it\u2019s possible that whole\nlengths of track may be preserved, even a train carriage. Preserved lengths of\nroad tunnels \u2013 complete with kerb stones, ventilation systems, and the glass\nand copper wiring of electric lighting \u2013 will hint at the 50 million km-long\n(31 million mile) network that once wrapped around the planet. Thick deposits\nof clinker in the harbours of major port cities, dumped overboard by coal-\npowered steam ships in the 19th Century, will be read like nodes in a map of\nglobal seafaring.\n\nThe fossil remains of Shanghai Tower could be matched to the remnants of other\ntall buildings in other cities, to form a portrait of a global culture of city\ndwellers who built with the same synthetic materials and used many of the same\nobjects day-to-day. This homogeneity would also express itself in future\npalaeobiology. Fossils of the same handful of species will turn up again and\nagain on every continent other than Antarctica. The \"Anthropocene rat\" will be\na signature species of the great age of city-building. Mixed with the rubble\nand plastic in landfill sites across the world will be the bones of some of\nthe 60 billion chickens killed for human consumption each year.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s likely that landfill, rather than the remains of cities\nthemselves, will tell the most richly-detailed stories. Modern landfill sites\ncan build up thicknesses of several tens of metres and cover many square\nkilometres. Lined with durable neoprene, they are filled with individual\nplastic bags full of waste, creating a double seal against the corrosive\ninfluence of UV light, oxygen, water, and chemical leachates. For each relic\ncity there will be a shadow city, vast fossil middens punctuated with the\noutlines of all that we discarded.\n\nEmmanuel Lafont\n\nEven the grandest city has no power against nature and time (Credit: Emmanuel\nLafont)\n\nThe future rock record will testify that not all of us had the same impact \u2013\nthat those settled near sites of extraction lived far less fossil fuel-\nintensive lives than those in cities. Future fossils will hint at this tale of\nglobal inequality. They may also tell of the impact we had on generations yet\nto be born, who were forced to live with the consequences of our carbon\naddiction.\n\nOf course, there may be no-one to find or make sense of what is left of our\ncities. But that doesn't mean that we should not seek to imagine the long-term\nlegacies we are leaving behind. We might all do well to think more like\ngeologists. The earth scientist Marcia Bjornerud calls for the cultivation of\n\"timefulness\", which she describes as \"a feeling for distances and proximities\nin the geography of deep time\". Her approach encourages us to think more\ntimefully about the scale of our impact on the planet, and consider what story\nwe want our future fossils to tell.\n\nAfter visiting Shanghai Tower, I took a train to Nanhui, a new city built on\nthe Pudong coast to accommodate Shanghai\u2019s over-spilling population. The tide\nwas out when I arrived on the beach. At my back, a wall just taller than me,\ncurving like a cresting wave, faced out to sea. Shanghai has constructed 520km\n(323 miles) of these sea barriers, but the ocean will take the city\neventually. Whether in 100 or 10,000 years from now, what once was one of the\nworld\u2019s greatest cities will begin a slow transformation into geology. \"Let me\nshow you the tide / that comes for us,\" write Kathy Jet\u00f1il-Kijiner and Aka\nNivi\u00e2na in their poem Rise, \"forcing us to imagine / turning ourselves into\nstone.\"\n\n* David Farrier is a professor of literature and the environment at the University of Edinburgh.
