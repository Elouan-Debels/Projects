Thankfully, I had roast chicken thighs and potatoes to work\nwith.\n\nThe purpose of batch cooking is to remix leftovers into simple, fast and\ndelicious meals throughout the week.\n\nBack to dinner time.\n\nMondays are Salad Bowl Mondays. I like salad-based meals on Mondays to\nreplenish from the weekend.\n\nI cranked out a fresh Greek Salad in 10 minutes, heated up and sliced the\nchicken and threw in the potatoes to make a simple salad.\n\nThe final product:\n\nNot bad, right?\n\nSimple frameworks like these are how I\u2019m able to cook each day of the week\nwhile enjoying my family.\n\nI want to share everything I know with you.\n\nI\u2019m putting together a self-paced course called Meal Machine OS.\n\nIt\u2019s jam packed with 21 years of my experience being a home cook. You\u2019ll get\neverything I know in this short, fast-paced course so you don\u2019t have to waste\ntime fumbling through the kitchen.\n\nYou\u2019ll get my exact lazy dad cook strategies and tactics, cooking fundamentals\nand hacks, recipe ideas and more.\n\nI\u2019ve been helping other Dad Cooks using this exact strategy to bring more\nharmony to family dinner.\n\nIf you or someone you know might be interested in making family dinners a\nplace where memories are made, I\u2019m taking pre-orders right now.\n\n\\- Mister Branzino #DeathToDelivery\n\nPS.
