Do I have good reasons to be excited about a programming\nlanguage that's been around for more than 25 years, which generally has a\nreputation of being the underdog compared to other languages?\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nThere are very good reasons to be excited about PHP these days. Today, I want\nto share some of the things I'm most excited about this year for PHP.\n\n## # Continuous evolution\n\nWhen Nikita left over two years ago \u2014 Nikita being the main contributor and\ndriver for PHP, he went to work on LLVM \u2014 I'll admit I was scared for PHP's\nfuture:\n\n> I'm a little worried now that Nikita has stepped down. He's definitely not\n> the only person capable of working on PHP's core, but he did a tremendous\n> amount of work these past years with PHP 8.0 and 8.1. I don't think 2022\n> will be the most mind blowing year for PHP, but rather a year of adding\n> stability.\n\nLooking back, I think that fear wasn't needed. The PHP Foundation has grown\ninto a well-established community, with now 10 developers being paid to work\non PHP core. Two major features being worked on at the moment come to mind:\nproperty hooks \u2014 which I'm hopeful for will pass once it comes to voting; and\na rework of Pecl \u2014 PHP's extension manager.\n\nOf course, I still got a sliver of hope when it comes to generics, which the\nFoundation is/was also looking into. I do think that the only viable way\nforward is runtime-ignored generics though, time will tell whether the\nFoundation will be able to cultivate a new mindset or not.\n\n## # FrankenPHP\n\nOne of the cool things happening in PHP land today is a project called\nFrankenPHP. It's been in the works for a year or two \u2014 if I remember\ncorrectly, and it's getting some real traction these days.\n\nFrankenPHP is an app server for PHP, written in Go, that gives existing PHP\napps a major performance boost, and it's super easy to get started with. It\nalso supports compiling PHP projects as standalone binaries, worker mode for\nlong-lived applications, is three times faster than PHP-FPM, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3\nsupport, and more.\n\nRecently, we've seen support for FrankenPHP for Laravel and Symfony. So it's\ngrowing into something big.\n\nNoticed a tpyo? You can submit a PR to fix it. If you want to stay up to date\nabout what's happening on this blog, you can subscribe to my mailing list:\nsend an email to brendt@stitcher.io, and I'll add you to the list.\n\n## # Laravel\n\nI think it's fair to say at this point that Laravel's marketing strategy is\nworking well. Laravel itself \u2014 the open source framework \u2014 is by far the most\npopular one within the PHP community; but they've also managed to create an\necosystem of products built with and for Laravel, to build a sustainable\nbusiness. Just recently, Laravel hired 6 new people, from a COO to BizOps to\nengineers; and Taylor mentioned that \"serious business is underway\".\n\nModern businesses are growing and embracing PHP, which is great to see.\n\nOne of the things I embraced last year was Laravel Livewire, a tool that\nallows you to write interactive apps, without any JavaScript. I did some\ntinkering with it, and had a lot of fun making a game:\n\n## # Discovering PHP\n\nWhat I found especially heartwarming to see is how people outside the PHP\ncommunity are re-discovering PHP. There have been a number of examples of\npeople coming from the JavaScript world, suddenly realising Laravel is a\nthing, and a good thing; and there are people like ThePrimeagen on YouTube who\nwere pleasantly surprised by PHP:\n\n## # Composer and Packagist\n\nThe PHP ecosystem keeps growing as well: there's a continuous growth in\npackages, indicating an active ecosystem.\n\nOn top of that, Packagist recently crossed the one hundred billion downloads\nmilestone. That's a doubling in two years time! We're now at 105 134 384 876,\nand that number keeps growing.\n\nI think it's fair to say: PHP is not dead!\n\nNoticed a tpyo? You can submit a PR to fix it.
