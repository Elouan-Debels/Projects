The reason is \u201cthe continuous anonymous\nstream of hateful messages and a lack of supervision from the owner.\u201d\n\nGVB, which provides public transport in and around Amsterdam, will only use\nits own communication channels, like its website and the GVB travel app called\nGappie, to inform travelers of travel information.\n\nThe public transport company will continue using Facebook, LinkedIn, and\nInstagram for social media purposes. Individual customer contact will be made\nvia WhatsApp and e-mail.\n\n\u201cThe social media website X has changed in the last few years,\u201d GVB wrote.\n\u201cWhat started as a platform for dialogue and the exchange of knowledge has now\nbecome a place for hateful and polarizing messages.
