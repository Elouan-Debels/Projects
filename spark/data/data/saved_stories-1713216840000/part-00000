That's okay!\n\n## 22 Mar 2024\n\nIn 2019 I did two surveys, first asking people what they think \u201cAPI\u201d meant and\nsecond asking people what \u201capplication\u201d in \u201capplication programming interface\u201d\nmeant.\n\nIn 2024 I ran a version of these two surveys combined that got 161 responses.\nAt the I end gave people a box where they could write anything they\u2019d like.\nLawrence Evalyn suggested that I make a little combinatory poem mixing\ntogether everybody\u2019s answers. Each line of this poem is a substring of a\ndifferent response:\n\n> Holy hell there\u2019s some sort of joke here This question melted my brain\n>\n> Low confidence Ultimately I would like to have a different name shape of an\n> http interface doesn\u2019t really fit\n>\n> Made me think! most applications are distributed this is pretty funny!\n>\n> cool survey haha Interesting questions Google is evil\n\nThe survey data is here in Google Sheets (sorry, at least one respondent!),\nalong with my sloppy what-passes-for-analysis analysis. (Free-form comments\nwere removed, since a fair number of them included identifying information.)\n\n## What do the letters in API stand for?\n\n\u201dWe\u201d actually do seem to know what words the letters in API stand for, more or\nless. The level of consistency between the two surveys is borderline\nimplausible:\n\n  * A is for Application: 90% in 2019, 91% in 2024\n  * P is for Programming: 81% in 2019, 81% in 2024\n  * I is for Interface: 96% in 2019, 96% in 2024\n\n91% of people answered that the P stood for \u201cprogrammumble:\u201d program,\nprogrammable, programmer, or programming. And some of the other answers, like\n\u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cprotocol,\u201d still clearly get at the same, correct, idea.\n\n## What does the word \u201cApplication\u201d mean?\n\nThis gets more interesting when you ask people the individual words comprising\n\u201cAPI\u201d mean.\n\n  * Is the application what you wrote using the API? (I think this is the common meaning when you\u2019re using the Java API to build something. I think it\u2019s also fair to say this was what \u201capplication\u201d meant when the term was coined.)\n  * Or is the application what you\u2019re controlling or accessing using the API? (I think this is the common meaning for the many uses of remote-procedure-call-based APIs on the web, where you\u2019re using the API to access and control some larger application, like Google Docs.)\n\nHere\u2019s the 2019 data next to the more recent survey, also broken down by\nyears-of-knowing-what-an-API-is:\n\nWho writes the \u201capplication\u201d in \u201capplication programming interface?\u201d\n\nThis chart gives us two pieces of evidence that the overall meaning of what\nthe \u201capplication\u201d in API means is gradually transitioning away from the\noriginal meaning (APIs help you build applications) to a new meaning (APIs are\nhow you access someone else\u2019s applications).\n\n  * The newer meaning has more popularity in this survey versus the 2019 survey.\n  * There is a pretty clear generational effect, with people who originally encountered the term longer ago more likely to say that an API is a programming interface one uses while building an application.\n\n## Does this matter?\n\nThe argument for \u201cyes\u201d is that, if you value being understood, it\u2019s worth\nknowing when terms that you think of as settled are, empirically, in flux. For\nthe meaning of API, it seems like we\u2019re past a tipping point now.\n\nI would strongly suggest that, if you\u2019re someone in a position of teaching\nfolks what API is, you\u2019re doing students a disservice if you only teach an\nempirically outdated definition.\n\nConversely, I think it\u2019s important for more-newly-minted software developers\nto know that \u201cAPI\u201d does not just mean \u201cREST API.\u201d (This is maybe less of a\nconcern that it was five years ago, though? I feel like I hear more talk about\nparts of the web platform, like the Web Storage API, than I did a few years\nago.)\n\nThe argument for \u201cno\u201d was best described by one of the respondents who\ndescribed the word \u201capplication\u201d as an \u201cempty signifier\u201d and the person who\ndescribed the term API as an \u201cindecomposable noun.\u201d I think that\u2019s correct: we\nall kind of know that API is used to describe a certain kind of documented,\nstable interface that get built between programming systems with significantly\ndifferent concerns.\n\nIt\u2019s actually great, in my opinion, that we have widely-accepted name for this\nkind of interface, because \u201cinterface\u201d is a pretty generic term with a broader\nmeaning. The REST APIs that you use to access applications like Zoom or Slack\nand the Web Storage API that you use to build stateful-yet-serverless web\napplications share a lot of fundamental similarities. The fact that I used\n\u201capplication\u201d referred to two \u201cdifferent sides of the API\u201d in the previous\nsystem isn\u2019t that big a deal unless you think too hard about it!\n\nI\u2019ll close with a modest proposal. Given the cultural love of recursive\nacronyms in some corners of tech culture, can we just say API means \u201cAPI\nProgramming Interface?\u201d It would save me from writing another survey in five\nyears.\n\nDiscuss this post on Mastodon (or whatever)\n\n", "frontpage": false}
