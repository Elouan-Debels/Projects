A Boeing engineer who fears parts of the company's 787 Dreamliner planes could break apart in mid-air has testified at a US Senate hearing\n  2. Sam Salehpour says his concerns were \u201cignored\u201d by Boeing over three years, and alleges that he was physically threatened by his bosses\n  3. Salehpour also claims that he saw workers jumping on plane parts like Tarzan to get them to align and fit together\n  4. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating Salehpour's claims of safety issues with how the planes are built\n  5. Boeing is under scrutiny over a series of incidents, including when a door blew out of a 737 Max plane shortly after take-off\n  6. Boeing - which is one of the world's two major producers of commercial planes - insists its jets are safe, and disputes the engineer's assertions\n\n## Live Reporting\n\nEdited by Tiffany Wertheimer\n\nAll times stated are UK\n\n  1. Posted at 18:3518:35\n\n### Why was Tarzan mentioned today?\n\nOne of the rather extraordinary claims made today by whistleblower Sam\nSalehpour, a quality engineer at Boeing, was that he said he saw workers\njumping on plane pieces to force them into place.\n\nWorkers building the planes would struggle to bridge the joints in the planes'\nmechanisms, he told the hearing, and would sometimes use blunt force.\n\n\"I literally saw people jumping on pieces of the airplane to get them to\nalign,\" he said.\n\n\"I call it the Tarzan effect.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Salehpour has made this claim, and according to the\nAssociated Press, Boeing officials have previously dismissed the allegation.\n\nBoeing has said his claims are \"inaccurate\" and that it was confident its\nplanes are safe.\n\n\"The issues raised have been subject to rigorous engineering examination under\n[Federal Aviation Administration] oversight,\" the company said last week.\n\nArticle share tools\n\n     * Share this post\n\n       * Copy this link\n\nRead more about these links.\n\n  2.

Posted at 18:0318:03\n\n### How safe is air travel?\n\nDespite the concerns outlined by the experts in today's hearings, the chances\nof being hurt on a commercial flight are low.\n\nAccording to trade publication FlightGlobal, there were only six fatal\ncommercial aviation accidents globally in 2023 - resulting in 115 deaths.\nCompare that to how many flights take off around the world - 36.8 million last\nyear, according to Statista.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates air accidents in\nthe US, recorded 20 major accidents involving US commercial planes in 2022.\nThat's down from 27 accidents recorded nationally in 2008.\n\nExperts agree, and statistics show, that flying is much safer than driving.\n\nHence the adage that you're more likely to get hurt on your way to the airport\nthan while aboard your flight.\n\nArticle share tools\n\n     * Share this post\n\n       * Copy this link\n\nRead more about these links.\n\n  4.

The\ncabin abruptly depressurised, creating a rush of air that ripped off the\nflight crews headsets and sent phones and other items flying out of the plane.\n\nThat raised serious safety concerns at the aerospace firm, which you can read\nabout here.\n\nArticle share tools\n\n     * Share this post\n\n       * Copy this link\n\nRead more about these links.\n\n  5.

Joe\nJacobsen and Sam Salehpour have also spoken extensively to the media about\ntheir claims.\n\nCongressional hearings are also notorious for being a stage for outrage and\ngrandstanding that leads to little action.\n\nStill, hosting these witnesses together, in Washington, is a sign of the\nseverity of the crisis facing Boeing, which has already announced a leadership\nshake-up as it tries to stem the criticism.\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal says he is planning future hearings and has asked\nthe FAA and Boeing to speak.\n\nArticle share tools\n\n     * Share this post\n\n       * Copy this link\n\nRead more about these links.\n\n  12.

They are warning of reduced flights and\npotentially higher fares as a result.\n\nAirbus is Boeing's main rival, but it has a backlog of thousands of orders,\nlimiting its ability to take advantage of the chaos - and to what extent\nairlines reliant on Boeing have a viable alternative.\n\nEarlier this year, air transport consultant John Strickland told the BBC it\nwas possible we could look back on this year as an inflection point for the\nindustry that allows new players to emerge from China and elsewhere.\n\n\"It could be a moment in time that changes the global landscape of the balance\nof manufacturing,\" he said.\n\nBut the shake-out will take decades.\n\nArticle share tools\n\n     * Share this post\n\n       * Copy this link\n\nRead more about these links.\n\n  16.

I have no proof of that.\"\n\nAsked by Senator Blumenthal to describe the verbal threats he received at\nwork, he says that after flagging safety issues: \"Someone told me they would\nhave killed someone like me if they [were to] say something like that\".\n\nEarlier he told the Senate committee: \u201cMy boss said I would have killed\nsomeone who said what you said in the meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not safety culture, when you get threatened by bringing issues of\nsafety concerns.\u201d\n\nArticle share tools\n\n     * Share this post\n\n       * Copy this link\n\nRead more about these links.\n\n  17.
