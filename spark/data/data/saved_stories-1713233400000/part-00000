Another A-50 aircraft was downed a month\nprior.\n\nOpinion: How many planes does Russia have?\n\nThe Ukrainian military shot down five Russian military aircraft in the span of\nthree days in early March, begging the question: How many planes does Russia\nhave? This is a complex question, but I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret: The\nnumbers listed in international indexes are often quite\n\nThe Kyiv IndependentAndrii Kharuk\n\nThree of the seven Russian A-50s are undergoing repairs and modernization,\naccording to the HUR.\n\n\"Two (planes) are at the Beriev Aircraft Company plant in Taganrog, and one at\nthe Ulyanovsk airfield, at the Aviastar aircraft factory,\" ArmyInform\nreported.\n\nYurii Ihnat, the former Air Force's spokesman, attributed the uptick in the\nnumber of downed aircraft to air defense systems supplied by Ukraine's allies,\nwhich reportedly can be moved closer to the border or the front line after a\ndecision of the military leadership.\n\nRussia's total losses during the all-out war amount to about 672 aircraft \u2014\n347 planes and 325 helicopters, according to Ukraine's General Staff.\n\nThe General Staff's figure could not be independently verified.\n\nOpinion: How many tanks does Russia have left?\n\nHow many tanks does Russia really have left? This question has come up quite\nfrequently in discussions, and it\u2019s simply impossible to find a precise answer\n\u2013 Russia\u2019s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and General Staff chief Valery\nGerasimov probably don\u2019t even know.
