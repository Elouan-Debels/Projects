To\naddress these critical issues, Auto Data was developed.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBefore continuing set up your OPENAI_API_KEY as your environment variable. If\nyou are unaware on how to do so, refer to this guide -\nhttps://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety\n\n  1. ### Installation:\n    \n        git clone https://github.com/Itachi-Uchiha581/Auto-Data.git\n\n  2. ### Usage Through CLI:\n    \n        cd Auto-Data\n    \n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n    \n        python main.py --help\n\nOutput of the above command:\n\n    \n        usage: Auto Data [-h] [--model MODEL] [--topic TOPIC] [--format {json,parquet}] [--engine {native}] [--threads THREADS] [--length LENGTH] [--system_prompt SYSTEM_PROMPT] Auto Data is a tool which automatically creates training data to fine tune Large-Language Models on! options: -h, --help show this help message and exit --model MODEL, -m MODEL Selection of an OpenAI model for data generation --topic TOPIC, -t TOPIC Topic for data generation, eg - Global Economy --format {json,parquet}, -f {json,parquet} The format of the output data produced by the LLM --engine {native}, -e {native} The backend used to generate data. More engines coming soon --threads THREADS, -th THREADS An integer to indicate how many chats to be created on the topic. A very high thread value may result in an error specially if your Open AI account is at tier 1. --length LENGTH, -l LENGTH The conversation length of a chat topic --system_prompt SYSTEM_PROMPT, -sp SYSTEM_PROMPT The system prompt that is to be given to the assistant.\n\nSample Usage given below\n\n    \n        python main.py --model \"gpt-4-turbo-preview\" --topic \"Mysteries and Horror stories\" --format \"json\" --engine \"native\" --threads 2 --length 2 --system_prompt \"You are a helpful assistant who has an interest in Mysteries and Horror stories. You are also excellent at articulating such stories\"\n\nIn the specified command, the model chosen is gpt-4-turbo-preview, and the\ntopic targeted is Mysteries and Horror Stories. The format for the output data\nis set to json, with the engine employed being native. The command indicates\nthe creation of 2 chat threads, each encompassing 2 complete back-and-forth\nconversations, as specified by the length parameter. The final parameter\nprovided serves as the system prompt for the assistant LLM.\n\nBelow is the trimmed output generated from the above command in json format:\n\n    \n        { \"Chats\": [ { \"messages\": [ { \"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant who has an interest in Mysteries and Horror stories.

While many purported paranormal phenomena can often be debunked with rigorous scientific examination, there remain a few cases that defy clear-cut explanations, leaving room for speculation and wonder. Here are a few notable examples:\\n\\n### 1. The Hessdalen Lights\\nIn the Hessdalen Valley of Norway, mysterious lights have been observed since at least the 1930s. These lights vary in color, intensity, and duration, sometimes moving with incredible speed, at other times hovering in place. Despite numerous studies, including Project Hessdalen initiated in the early 1980s, the complete scientific explanation for these lights remains elusive. Various hypotheses have been proposed, including ionized iron dust, plasma, and even the piezoelectric effects from tectonic strain, but none has definitively solved the mystery.\\n\\n### 2. The Voynich Manuscript\\nThe Voynich Manuscript is a 15th-century book that has baffled linguists, cryptographers, and computer scientists for decades. Its language has never been deciphered, and the strange illustrations of unfamiliar plants and astronomical diagrams add to its mystique. While not paranormal in the conventional sense, the manuscript's origin, purpose, and message could be described as a \\\"scientific ghost,\\\" eluding comprehension and resolution.\\n\\n### 3. .............\" } ], \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-preview\", \"sub_topic\": \"sharing personal experiences with the paranormal or unexplainable events\", \"system_prompt\": \"You are a helpful assistant who has an interest in Mysteries and Horror stories.
