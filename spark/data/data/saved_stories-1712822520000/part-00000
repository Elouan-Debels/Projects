Now, physicists at Princeton University have\npushed the boundaries of our understanding of these minute particles by\nvisualizing, for the first time, direct evidence for what is known as the\nWigner crystal\u2014a strange kind of matter that is made entirely of electrons.\n\nThe finding, published in Nature, confirms a 90-year-old theory that electrons\ncan assemble into a crystal-like formation of their own, without the need to\ncoalesce around atoms. The research could help lead to the discovery of new\nquantum phases of matter when electrons behave collectively.\n\n\"The Wigner crystal is one of the most fascinating quantum phases of matter\nthat has been predicted and the subject of numerous studies claiming to have\nfound, at best, indirect evidence for its formation,\" said Al Yazdani, the\nJames S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor in Physics at Princeton\nUniversity and the senior author of the study. \"Visualizing this crystal\nallows us not only to watch its formation, confirming many of its properties,\nbut we can also study it in ways you couldn't in the past.\"\n\nIn the 1930s, Eugene Wigner, a Princeton professor of physics and winner of\nthe 1963 Nobel Prize for his work in quantum symmetry principles, wrote a\npaper in which he proposed the then-revolutionary idea that interaction among\nelectrons could lead to their spontaneous arrangement into a crystal-like\nconfiguration, or lattice, of closely packed electrons. This could only occur,\nhe theorized, because of their mutual repulsion and under conditions of low\ndensities and extremely cold temperatures.\n\n\"When you think of a crystal, you typically think of an attraction between\natoms as a stabilizing force, but this crystal forms purely because of the\nrepulsion between electrons,\" said Yazdani, who is the inaugural co-director\nof the Princeton Quantum Institute and director of the Princeton Center for\nComplex Materials.\n\nFor a long time, however, Wigner's strange electron crystal remained in the\nrealm of theory. It was not until a series of much later experiments that the\nconcept of an electron crystal transformed from conjecture to reality. The\nfirst of these was conducted in the 1970s when scientists at Bell Laboratories\nin New Jersey created a \"classical\" electron crystal by spraying electrons on\nthe surface of helium and found that they responded in a rigid manner like a\ncrystal.\n\nHowever, the electrons in these experiments were very far apart and behaved\nmore like individual particles than a cohesive structure. A true Wigner\ncrystal, instead of following the familiar laws of physics in the everyday\nworld, would follow the laws of quantum physics, in which the electrons would\nact not like individual particles but more like a single wave.\n\nThis led to a whole series of experiments over the next decades that proposed\nvarious ways to create quantum Wigner crystals. These experiments were greatly\nadvanced in the 1980s and 1990s when physicists discovered how to confine\nelectrons' motion to atomically thin layers using semiconductors.\n\nThe application of a magnetic field to such layered structures also makes\nelectrons move in a circle, creating favorable conditions for crystallization.\nHowever, these experiments were never able to observe the crystal directly.\nThey were only able to suggest its existence or indirectly infer it from how\nelectrons flow through the semiconductor.\n\n00:00\n\n00:34\n\nThe video describes the melting processes of an electron Wigner crystal into\nelectron-liquid phases. Credit: Princeton University\n\n\"There are literally hundreds of scientific papers that study these effects\nand claim that the results must be due to the Wigner crystal,\" Yazdani said,\n\"but one can't be sure because none of these experiments actually see the\ncrystal.\"\n\nAn equally important consideration, Yazdani noted, is that what some\nresearchers think is evidence of a Wigner crystal could be the result of\nimperfections or other periodic structures inherent to the materials used in\nthe experiments.\n\n\"If there are any imperfections or some form of periodic substructure in the\nmaterial, it is possible to trap electrons and find experimental signatures\nthat are not due to the formation of a self-organized ordered Wigner crystal\nitself, but due to electrons 'stuck' near an imperfection or trapped because\nof the material's structure,\" he said.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, Yazdani and his research team set about to\nsee whether they could directly image the Wigner crystal using a scanning\ntunneling microscope (STM), a device that relies on a technique called\n\"quantum tunneling\" rather than light to view the atomic and subatomic world.\n\nThey also decided to use graphene, an amazing material that was discovered in\nthe 21st century and has been used in many experiments involving novel quantum\nphenomena. To successfully conduct the experiment, however, the researchers\nhad to make the graphene as pristine and as devoid of imperfections as\npossible. This was key to eliminating the possibility of any electron crystals\nforming because of material imperfections.\n\nThe results were impressive. \"Our group has been able to make unprecedentedly\nclean samples that made this work possible,\" Yazdani said. \"With our\nmicroscope we can confirm that the samples are without any atomic imperfection\nin the graphene atomic lattice or foreign atoms on its surface over regions\nwith hundreds of thousands of atoms.\"\n\nTo make pure graphene, the researchers exfoliated two carbon sheets of\ngraphene in a configuration that is called Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene\n(BLG). They then cooled the sample down to extremely low temperatures\u2014just a\nfraction of a degree above absolute zero\u2014and applied a magnetic field\nperpendicular to the sample, which created a two-dimensional electron gas\nsystem within the thin layers of graphene. With this, they could tune the\ndensity of the electrons between the two layers.\n\n\"In our experiment, we can image the system as we tune the number of electrons\nper unit area,\" said Yen-Chen Tsui, a graduate student in physics and the\nfirst author of the paper. \"Just by changing the density, you can initiate\nthis phase transition and find electrons spontaneously form into an ordered\ncrystal.\"\n\nThis happens, Tsui explained, because at low densities, the electrons are far\napart from each other\u2014and they're situated in a disordered, disorganized\nfashion. However, as you increase the density, which brings the electrons\ncloser together, their natural repulsive tendencies kick in, and they start to\nform an organized lattice. Then, as you increase the density further, the\ncrystalline phase will melt into an electron liquid.\n\nMinhao He, a postdoctoral researcher and co-first author of the paper,\nexplained this process in greater detail. \"There is an inherent repulsion\nbetween the electrons,\" he said. \"They want to push each other away, but in\nthe meantime, the electrons cannot be infinitely apart due to the finite\ndensity. The result is that they form a closely packed, regularized lattice\nstructure, with each of the localized electron occupying a certain amount of\nspace.\"\n\nWhen this transition formed, the researchers were able to visualize it using\nthe STM. \"Our work provides the first direct images of this crystal. We proved\nthe crystal is really there, and we can see it,\" said Tsui.\n\nHowever, just visualizing the crystal wasn't the end of the experiment. A\nconcrete image of the crystal allowed them to distinguish some of the\ncrystal's characteristics. They discovered that the crystal is triangular in\nconfiguration and that it can be continuously tuned with the density of the\nparticles. This led to the realization that the Wigner crystal is actually\nquite stable over a very long range, a conclusion that is contrary to what\nmany scientists have surmised.\n\n\"By being able to tune its lattice constant continuously, the experiment\nproved that the crystal structure is the result of the pure repulsion between\nthe electrons,\" said Yazdani.\n\nThe researchers also discovered several other interesting phenomena that will\nno doubt warrant further investigation in the future. They found that the\nlocation to which each electron is localized in the lattice appears in the\nimages with a certain amount of \"blurring,\" as if the location is not defined\nby a point but a range position in which the electrons are confined in the\nlattice. The paper described this as the \"zero-point\" motion of electrons, a\nphenomenon related to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The extent of this\nblurriness reflects the quantum nature of the Wigner crystal.\n\n\"Electrons, even when frozen into a Wigner crystal, should exhibit strong\nzero-point motion,\" said Yazdani. \"It turns out this quantum motion covers a\nthird of the distance between them, making the Wigner crystal a novel quantum\ncrystal.\"\n\nYazdani and his team are also examining how the Wigner crystal melts and\ntransitions into other exotic liquid phases of interacting electrons in a\nmagnetic field. The researchers hope to image these phases just as they have\nimaged the Wigner crystal.\n\nMore information: Ali Yazdani, Direct observation of a magnetic-field-induced\nWigner crystal, Nature (2024).
