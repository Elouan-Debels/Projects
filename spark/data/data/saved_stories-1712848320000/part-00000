With most jobs, our looks should be regarded as\nirrelevant to our suitability and remuneration. What matters is that we have\nthe skills for the job and put them to good use. Yet appearance\ndiscrimination, or \u2018lookism\u2019, is pervasive and consequential in the workplace.\nCan lookism in employment ever be justified? And, when it can\u2019t, should we\nlegislate against it?\n\nThe first of these questions might seem to have an easy answer, namely, that\nlookism can be justified only when appearance is a genuine qualification for\nwork, that is, has a real bearing on a person\u2019s ability to do a job or do it\nwell, such as modelling or some acting roles. But this just pushes back the\nproblem. We must now ask: when is appearance a genuine qualification for a\njob? And even: should genuine qualifications always count, or can there be\nmoral reasons for not counting them?\n\nMuch the same questions arise in relation to race and gender. There are cases\nwhen each of these can be regarded, reasonably, as a \u2018genuine occupational\nrequirement\u2019, for example, \u2018being a woman\u2019 for a women\u2019s refuge support\nworker. But it is equally clear that \u2018being a man\u2019 cannot justifiably count as\na qualification for being a doctor, even if patients might be happier\nreceiving medical advice from a man because, for sexist reasons, they rate\nmen\u2019s medical skills more highly. And that is so even though there\u2019s a sense\nin which being a man is a genuine qualification for the job when a male doctor\nwould be better able to minister to patients\u2019 needs because their prejudices\nmean they\u2019d trust him more and hence be more receptive to his advice. In other\nwords, there are some genuine qualifications that it is not justifiable to\ncount.\n\nConsider two cases that concern the treatment of employees in the workplace\nand vividly raise worries about appearance unjustifiably counting as a\nqualification. The first relates to a performance evaluation of an employee\ncalled Courtney at a Canadian fashion company whose manager said her looks\nwere affecting her ability to do her job. Interviewed by the BBC in 2022,\nCourtney said:\n\n> He point-blank told me that he thought I was too fat to be in the position I\n> was in. He told me he was embarrassed having me around our vendors in\n> meetings, and that it ruined his reputation.\n\nHe then advised her to start going to the gym and avoid wearing fitted\nclothing. Unsurprisingly, Courtney felt shell-shocked. Subsequently, her\nappearance anxieties had a negative impact on her work because she was\ndistracted by worries about what her colleagues thought of her.\n\nOur responses to the looks of others often involve unjustified associations,\nwhether positive or negative\n\nThe second case relates to an accusation in 2020 by the UK radio journalist\nLibby Purves against the BBC. Purves claimed that, for presenters on both\ntelevision and radio, older women were under greater pressure than men of a\nsimilar age to appear younger, since women are judged on their looks, and part\nof what it is to be attractive for women is to look youthful. In an opinion\npiece for the Radio Times, she wrote:\n\n> Sue Barker has been binned from A Question of Sport after 23 years. She is\n> 64. More willingly, Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey depart from Woman\u2019s Hour,\n> aged 70 and 56. They are replaced by Emma Barnett, a mere 35. What is this?\n> ... Are we written off as old trouts while men become revered elders, sacred\n> patriarchs, silver foxes?\n\nIn both cases, lookism seems entangled with sex or gender discrimination, and,\nin the second case, with age discrimination too. This might provoke the\nthought that appearance discrimination is problematic only when it is entwined\nwith some other form of discrimination, and that there is no reason to be\nconcerned about it when it occurs on its own. But that seems clearly false.\nAppearance discrimination matters in its own right, and indeed operates in\nmany of the same ways as other forms of discrimination we are committed to\nfighting, such as racial discrimination. Just as prejudices influence\nbehaviour consciously and non-consciously in racial discrimination, so too\nthey operate in conscious and non-conscious ways in lookism. Our responses to\nthe looks of others often involve unjustified associations, whether positive\nor negative, between appearance features and character traits. These\nassociations may function as implicit biases, or sometimes take the form of\nstereotypes that are endorsed with varying degrees of unreflectiveness.\n\nWomen especially are often seen as lazy or lacking in self-discipline if they\nare perceived as overweight. But even though lifestyle choices make a\ndifference to shape, the hunger we experience and how much we weigh are\nlargely determined by metabolism or physiology. So the idea that all or even\nmost people with a heavier weight lack self-control is unsustainable when\nbrought into contact with the evidence. In her book Unshrinking: How to Fight\nFatphobia (2024), Kate Manne concludes that \u2018fatness has a strong genetic\nbasis ... at least 70 per cent of the variance in body mass that we find in\nthe human population is likely due to genetics.\u2019\n\nOf course, it is not just selectors evaluating qualifications who are prone to\nbiases. Good looks tend to be beneficial in doing a range of jobs because of\nhow others respond to them. Viewers may prefer to watch attractive newsreaders\ndeliver the TV news, perhaps in part because they associate their appearance\nwith desirable character traits, such as trustworthiness. Customers may be put\noff interacting with employees they regard as fat because they find their\nappearance unattractive or judge them to be ill-disciplined. It\u2019s for reasons\nof this sort that good looks can be genuine qualifications for working in\ncustomer-facing roles, even though there is a further question about whether\nit\u2019s justifiable to count them.\n\nQualifications that arise in this way are often referred to as \u2018reaction\nqualifications\u2019, meaning qualifications produced by customer reactions to\nemployee characteristics. As a result, even selectors who do not share the\ncustomers\u2019 biases have a reason to appoint people with their customers\u2019\npreferred features, and to reject those with features their customers dislike.\nIn contrast, when a technical skill is a qualification for a job, its role as\na qualification, and indeed its status as a skill, doesn\u2019t generally rely on\nothers\u2019 reactions to it. All that matters is that it is deployed in making a\nproduct that people want or providing a service they need. For example, the\nskill of giving competent legal advice is a qualification for being a lawyer,\nregardless of how others respond to it.\n\nIn addition to the association between heavier weight and laziness or lack of\nself-control, people routinely make other appearance-related associations.\nShort men are often regarded as prickly or prone to aggression on the basis\nthat they have inferiority complexes. Facial scarring, and other so-called\n\u2018facial disfigurements\u2019, are often associated with unpleasantness or nastiness\n\u2013 think of Hollywood villains. Again, these associations don\u2019t stand up\nagainst the evidence. When reaction qualifications are rooted in unjustified\nassociations, is it fair to count them? We don\u2019t think it\u2019s morally acceptable\nto count reaction qualifications when they are grounded in, say, customers\u2019\nprejudices against women or members of a particular race, so why think it\u2019s\nmorally acceptable to count such qualifications when they are grounded in\ncustomers\u2019 prejudices against particular appearance features?\n\nThere\u2019s no getting away from the fact that ignoring customer preferences would\nbe bad for business\n\nEven when they don\u2019t involve prejudices or unjustified associations,\ncustomers\u2019 perceptions about whether an assistant is good looking, and indeed\nthe perceptions of job recruiters, are usually a product of \u2018internalising\u2019\nappearance norms \u2013 that is, rules concerning how we should look \u2013 that reflect\nconventional aesthetic preferences. Some of these norms may have gained\ncurrency over many generations, as a result of the way that being disposed to\nact from them when choosing sexual partners bestows evolutionary advantages,\nas Nancy Etcoff argues in Survival of the Prettiest (2000). Perhaps this is\ntrue of norms that favour unblemished skin or symmetrical faces. But other\nappearance norms expressing aesthetic preferences emerge from practices that\nare specific to particular cultures, and may even be a product of differences\nin power and privilege. For example, the emergence of norms regarding tightly\ncoiled hair as messy, or favouring narrow rather than broad noses, or lighter\nover darker skin tones, can perhaps be fully explained by the way in which\nthey reflect and perpetuate racial hierarchies \u2013 that is, they come to be\nendorsed because they legitimate the power and privilege that accrues to\nmembership in particular racial groups. Even when norms are not the product of\npower and privilege, their application may end up benefiting people who are\nalready advantaged, and further disadvantaging those who are already\ndisadvantaged. Think here of norms biased against women or the elderly, or\nboth, such as norms that regard youthfulness as part of what it is to be an\nattractive woman, which Purves thinks are influencing decisions at the BBC.\n\nBut there\u2019s no getting away from the fact that ignoring customer preferences\nwould be bad for business. Therefore, reaction qualifications grounded in such\npreferences provide some credibility to recruitment decisions based on them.\nIn contrast, when selectors but not customers are influenced by looks, then no\nsuch justification is available. We don\u2019t know whether vendors were put off by\nCourtney\u2019s appearance or whether it was only her manager who had a problem\nwith it. But it is surely unfair to candidates when managers\u2019 hiring (or\npromotion) decisions are influenced by employees\u2019 appearance if it is not even\na reaction qualification. Indeed, it is generally unfair to take into account\nfeatures of a person, whether racial membership or looks, when these have\nabsolutely nothing to do with their ability to do the job.\n\nPrejudices and negative associations concerning various appearance features\nunfairly reduce the range of career opportunities for people with these\nfeatures. This then contributes to an unjust distribution of resources, and\nmay even reinforce structural injustices. According to Daniel Hamermesh\u2019s\nanalysis of data from the United States in Beauty Pays (2011), the overall\n\u2018beauty premium\u2019 for above-average-looking women, compared with below-average-\nlooking women, is 12 per cent; for above-average-looking men, compared with\nbelow-average-looking men, it is 17 per cent. Perhaps appearance is a\nlegitimate qualification for some jobs, such as modelling, in which case not\nall such inequalities will be unjust, but often lookism seems analogous to\nracial discrimination, and condemnable for many of the same reasons.\n\nBut there are also cases of lookism that are rather different from racial\ndiscrimination because they involve responding to chosen features of\nappearance, such as tattoos, hairstyles and piercings. It is tempting to say\nthat if a person is disadvantaged by an appearance feature they\u2019ve chosen, in\nfull knowledge that acquiring it will affect their employment prospects, then\nthere is no injustice. But even here, customers may be opposed to such\nfeatures for no good reason, for example, when tattoos are unjustifiably\nassociated with aggression or mental health problems. Is it fair, in a job\nmarket, to disadvantage a person by her choices when that disadvantage\nreflects the prejudices of selectors or customers responding negatively to\nfeatures she\u2019s chosen for herself and that may even have become part of her\nidentity?\n\nPeople may also make choices designed to improve their chances in particular\njob markets, for example, they may have liposuction, Botox injections or hair\ntransplants, often to appear younger. This is especially so in visual media\nwhere, as Purves points out, part of what it is for women to be attractive is\nto look youthful. It would be easy to describe these interventions as chosen,\nbut we should hesitate before doing so. Decisions to have them are often a\nproduct not only of seeking to improve one\u2019s employment opportunities but also\nbody-shaming practices. Indeed, as Heather Widdows argues in Perfect Me\n(2018), appearance norms form an ethical ideal, with those who fail to comply\nbeing regarded as not merely unattractive but morally flawed, because they are\nseen as failing in their duty to make the best of themselves. This ideal has\nbecome so demanding that it is oppressive to many people, especially women and\nyounger men. When jobs are allocated in a way that rewards people who conform\nto these norms, then they are reinforced, and the pressures to conform to them\nbecome even greater.\n\nAppearance features may express deeply held convictions about how one should\nlive\n\nAppearance features that are favoured or disfavoured in the job market may\nalso be chosen by people in a way that reflects their own ethical commitments\nrather than dominant appearance norms. For example, some women choose not to\nwear makeup because they want to resist the idea of women as aesthetically\nappealing objects. As Clare Chambers writes in Intact (2022), they endorse the\nprinciple of the unmodified body \u2013 that our bodies are alright just as they\nare. As a resistance to body-shaming practices, people may consciously eschew\nbody modifications and withstand the pressures placed on them by the often\nvicious comments they receive. Others may be committed to ethical principles\nderived from their religion requiring conformity to unconventional appearance\nnorms or dress codes.\n\nSo appearance features may express deeply held convictions about how one\nshould live. When companies have an ethos that reflects such convictions, and\nthey discriminate in their selection practices to promote that ethos, then\nthat often seems unobjectionable. Suppose, for example, that a company has an\nethos that reflects a commitment to not wearing makeup, and requires their\nemployees to adopt \u2018a natural look\u2019 as a condition of employment. That does\nnot seem morally problematic in the context of a society where there is an\nexpectation in a wide range of jobs that women should wear makeup. Yet in\nother cases, appearance codes may discriminate against members of a particular\nreligion, even if they do so unintentionally. For example, a dress code\nforbidding employees from wearing head coverings seems morally problematic\nbecause of the way in which it disadvantages Muslim women.\n\nLookism in employment is therefore a mixed bag. Some cases seem to involve the\nsame characteristic mechanisms as racial discrimination, including prejudices\ninfluencing hiring decisions, to be morally condemned for much the same\nreasons. Other cases seem rather different. They may differ because the\nappearance-related values that companies express in their hiring practices\nneither reflect prejudices nor deny the fundamental equality of different\npeople. Or they may differ because the appearance features that recruiters\ncount as reaction qualifications are unobjectionable, perhaps in part because\nthese features are genuinely a matter of choice for job applicants.\n\nIn cases where lookism is morally problematic, what should we do about it?\nShould we think of it as posing a moral problem of sufficient magnitude that\nthere is a case for seeking to prevent it by legislation? Or is it better to\ntackle it without recourse to the legal system? There is evidence that lookism\nin employment is comparable in pervasiveness and harmfulness with other forms\nof discrimination, including racial discrimination. On the basis of his\nanalysis of the data, Hamermesh maintains that, in the US:\n\n> African American men\u2019s earnings disadvantage, adjusted for the earnings-\n> enhancing characteristics that they bring to labour markets, is similar to\n> the disadvantage experienced by below-average compared to above-average-\n> looking male workers generally.\n\nOf course, there are differences between racial discrimination and appearance\ndiscrimination that may impact upon the case for enacting legislation to\nprevent it, and not merely the fact that (unlike race) some appearance\nfeatures are chosen. Racial membership is commonly transmitted from one\ngeneration to another, whereas the inheritance of appearance-related\ncharacteristics is less reliable. The way in which racial discrimination\ncontributes to and reproduces structural disadvantages through practices of\nsegregation gives rise to distinctive problems in tackling it. Nevertheless,\nsome of the same reasons that provide a strong case for prohibiting racial\ndiscrimination also apply to appearance discrimination.\n\nThe long-term solution to the injustices of lookism involves taking measures\nto reduce the enormous weight ordinarily placed on appearance in our society\nand seeking to change appearance norms so that they become more inclusive. But\ngiven the magnitude of the problem, we should take seriously the idea that\nlegislation also has role to play. Should we make \u2018appearance\u2019 or appearance\nfeatures such as height, weight and facial differences protected\ncharacteristics, in the same way that, in countries like the UK, race, sex,\nsexual orientation, disability, religion and age are \u2018protected\ncharacteristics\u2019, meaning it is illegal to discriminate on their basis?\n\nThe legislation itself wouldn\u2019t require us to make objective judgments about\npeople\u2019s attractiveness\n\nPerhaps legislation against \u2018indirect\u2019 discrimination, that is, against\npolicies and practices that unintentionally affect people with a protected\ncharacteristic in a negative way, is enough to criminalise much appearance\ndiscrimination in hiring and promotion decisions, providing an underutilised\nway of combatting it. Suppose that appearance norms and dress codes are biased\nagainst people with tightly coiled hair, or with darker skin tones, or with\nasymmetrical faces or bodies, or with wrinkly skin, or against those who see\nit as part of their religious duty to dress modestly, or against women who\nobject to being required to wear makeup or heels. Then selecting people on the\nbasis of their conformity to these norms (or their willingness to conform to\nthem) will stand in need of justification in any legislative scheme that\nrequires indirect discrimination on grounds of race, sex, disability, age or\nreligion to be a proportionate means to a legitimate goal. But it is not clear\nthat legislation against indirect discrimination is enough to deal adequately\nwith the moral challenge posed by lookism in employment.\n\nMy proposal would be this: we make it illegal to reject a person on the basis\nof their appearance, or particular appearance-related features, when no\nplausible case can be made that these features are qualifications for the job\nin question \u2013 when possession of them can\u2019t even be seen as a way of\nconforming to a company\u2019s ethos or attracting its customers or clients. We\ncould add to this the requirement that reaction qualifications, that is,\nqualifications that rely on the responses of customers, shouldn\u2019t be given any\nweight if they rest upon customers\u2019 prejudices about an appearance feature,\nwhere prejudices are generalisations or associations that aren\u2019t sustained by\nthe publicly available evidence. And we could make it a presumption that when\nthe background culture is infused with these prejudices about a particular\nappearance feature, then reaction qualifications related to that feature\nshould be regarded as illegitimate, unless evidence can be produced for\nthinking that customer preferences for it are unconnected to such prejudices.\n\nSome may be sceptical about whether legislation against lookism could be\neffective, with good reasons. Part of the problem with legislation in this\narea is that there is likely to be resistance to making use of it \u2013 who wants\nto admit that others regard them as unattractive? Furthermore, appearance\ndiscrimination can be hard to detect and monitor. The legislation itself\nwouldn\u2019t require us to make objective judgments about people\u2019s attractiveness.\nWe just have to know that selectors have been influenced by the candidates\u2019\nappearance, or by the particular appearance features they possess, when these\nhave nothing to do with their ability to do the job. But we do need to be able\nto monitor different companies to see whether there is any reason to think\nthat they aren\u2019t complying with the legislation. With race and gender, we can\nexamine percentages in the workforce or selected through the appointment\nprocess. But how can we do that in relation to an attractive appearance?\n\nThere is a surprisingly large amount of intersubjective agreement concerning\njudgments of attractiveness, and it may well be enough to collect the data\nrequired for monitoring purposes. So I think that the objections to\nlegislation against appearance discrimination are not insuperable. It is\nfeasible, and no less desirable than other forms of antidiscrimination\nlegislation. But perhaps the main function of legislation against appearance\ndiscrimination would be to send out a message to employers, and society more\ngenerally, that lookism is unacceptable, and to give companies a reason to\nexamine their practices and reform them if they encourage lookism or give it\ntoo much space in which to operate. We might even regard it as good practice\nfor recruitment interviewees to be behind a screen, as is sometimes done when\nauditioning musicians. In the context of employment at least, we should combat\nwhat Francesca Minerva calls the \u2018invisible discrimination\u2019 that takes place\nright before our eyes. We\u2019ve been too complacent about lookism at the\nworkplace for too long.\n\nEthicsHuman rights and justiceWork\n\n4 April 2024\n\nEmail\n\nSave\n\nPost\n\nShare\n\nSyndicate this essay\n\nSave\n\nessay\n\nHistory of technology\n\nWhy America fell for guns\n\nThe US today has extraordinary levels of gun ownership.
