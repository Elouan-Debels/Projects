The department\u2019s complaint alleges that UDOC failed to provide the\ncomplainant equal access to health care services after she repeatedly\nrequested hormone therapy, and also failed to make reasonable modifications to\nits policies and practices to treat her gender dysphoria. Before filing this\nlawsuit, the department gave UDOC written notice of its findings and an\noutline of remedial measures necessary to address them.\n\nGender dysphoria is a serious medical condition marked by clinically\nsignificant distress caused by an incongruence between the sex an individual\nis assigned at birth and their gender identity. Left untreated, individuals\nwith gender dysphoria can experience serious adverse mental health outcomes.\n\n\u201cPeople with gender dysphoria, including those held in jails and prisons, are\nprotected by the Americans with Disabilities Act and are entitled to equal\naccess to medical care just like anyone else with a disability,\u201d said\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil\nRights Division. \u201cDelays or refusals to provide medical treatment for people\nwith gender dysphoria can cause irreparable harm, including debilitating\ndistress, depression, attempts at self-treatment and even death by suicide.\nThe Civil Rights Division is committed to protecting the rights of all people\nwith disabilities in our country, including those who experience gender\ndysphoria \u2013 and those rights are not given up at the jailhouse door.\u201d\n\nThe department\u2019s complaint alleges that UDOC imposes unnecessary barriers to\ntreatment for incarcerated individuals with gender dysphoria that are not\nrequired for other health conditions, and unnecessarily delayed the\ncomplainant\u2019s treatment. The complaint also alleges that UDOC failed to grant\nthe complainant\u2019s requests for reasonable modifications, including permitting\nher to purchase female clothing and personal items in the commissary,\nmodifying pat search policies and appropriately assessing her housing requests\nto avoid discrimination on the basis of gender dysphoria. As a result, her\ngender dysphoria worsened during her incarceration at UDOC. Twenty-two months\nafter entering custody, she performed dangerous self-surgery and removed her\nown testicles.\n\nThe department\u2019s lawsuit is part of its broader efforts to combat\ndiscrimination against individuals with gender dysphoria. These include the\nCivil Rights Division\u2019s recently filed statement of interest clarifying that\ngender dysphoria can be a covered disability under the ADA and explaining that\ncorrectional institutions violate the Eighth Amendment when they categorically\nrefuse to provide medically necessary gender-affirming care to incarcerated\nindividuals with gender dysphoria and a challenge to Tennessee\u2019s SB1 which\nmakes it unlawful to provide or offer to provide certain types of medical care\nfor transgender minors with diagnosed gender dysphoria.\n\nThe Civil Rights Division\u2019s Disability Rights Section is handling this matter\nin collaboration with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Utah.\n\nFor more information on the Civil Rights Division, please visit\nwww.justice.gov/crt.
