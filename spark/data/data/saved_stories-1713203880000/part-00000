The grade of a\nmultivector \u03b1 will be written \u2223\u03b1\u2223, while its magnitude will be written \u2225\u03b1\u2225.\nBold letters like u will refer to (grade-1) vectors, while Greek letters like\n\u03b1 refer to arbitrary multivectors with grade \u2223\u03b1\u2223.\n\nYou may have noticed that the behavior of the wedge product on pure\nmultivectors is to append them as lists: wx\u2227yz=wxyz, where some signs come in\nif you\u2019d rather have the terms in a different order. This could also be\ninterpreted as taking their union as sets. Either way, \u2227 seems to act like a\nunion or concatenation operation combined with a bonus antisymmetrization step\nwhich has the effect of making duplicate terms like x\u2227x vanish.\n\nIn fact, if we forget about the scalars on some pure multivectors \u03b1, \u03b2 and\njust consider them as sets of basis vectors, for example x\u2227y\u2192(x,y), then:\n\n\u03b1\u2227\u03b2={\u00b1\u03b1\u222a\u03b20 if \u03b1\u2229\u03b2=\u2205 otherwise\n\nAnd the interior product acts like set subtraction:\n\n\u03b1\u22c5\u03b2={\u00b1\u03b2\u2216\u03b10 if \u03b1\u2286\u03b2 otherwise\n\nIt turns out that a lot of identities are consistent with this model; for\nexample, (\u03b1\u2227\u03b2)\u22c5\u03b3=\u03b2\u22c5(\u03b1\u22c5\u03b3) expresses the same thing, more or less, as the set\nalgebra identity C\u2216(A\u222aB)=(C\u2216A)\u2216B. These seem not to be coincidences: there\nturns out to be a sense in which exterior algebra is very nearly a \u201clinearized\nset algebra\u201d. I have seen mentions of this in lots of places. From \u201cOn the\nExterior Calculus of Invariant Theory\u201d (Barnabei, Brini, Rota 1985):\n\n> In the context of Peano spaces the theory of this operator acquires a\n> crystalline simplicity, and the algebraic system obtained by meet, join and\n> star operator is at last seen to be the much-sought-after linear analog of\n> the Boolean algebra of sets with intersection, union and complement, an\n> analogy which was first intuited by Grassmann and later pursued, with\n> partial success, by Clifford, Peano, Burali-Forti and A. N. Whitehead.\n\nA more direct quote of Rota: \u201cPhilosophically, the exterior algebra is a\n\u201clinearization\u201d of the Boolean algebra of all subsets of {1,2,...,n}.\u201d -\nCombinatorics: The Rota Way\u201d. So the analogy is mentioned, but I haven\u2019t come\nacross much more of an explanation. I thought I would investigate.\n\n## 2\\. Set Algebra\n\nA boolean algebra is a set A equipped with two binary options \u2227 (\u201cmeet\u201d) and \u2228\n(\u201cjoin\u201d), a unary option \u00ac (\u201ccomplement\u201d) and two distinguished elements 0\n(\u201cbottom\u201d) and 1 (\u201ctop\u201d), with these axioms for all a,b,c\u2208A:\n\na\u2228(b\u2228c)a\u2228ba\u2228(a\u2227b)a\u22270a\u2228(b\u2227c)a\u2228\u00aca=(a\u2228b)\u2228c=b\u2228a=a=a=(a\u2228b)\u2227(a\u2228c)=1a\u2227(b\u2227c)a\u2227ba\u2227(a\u2228b)a\u22281a\u2227(b\u2228c)a\u2227\u00aca=(a\u2227b)\u2227c)=b\u2227a=a=a=(a\u2227b)\u2228(a\u2227c)=0\n\nThe conventional algebra of (true,false) is an example of this, where \u2227 is\n\u201cand\u201d, \u2228 is \u201cor\u201d, \u00ac is \u201cnot\u201d, and 0=false and 1=true. The terminology of\n\u201cmeet\u201d and \u201cjoin\u201d comes from lattices, of which this structure is an example.\n\nSet algebra is an example of a boolean algebra on the subsets 2U of a\n\u201cuniverse\u201d set U, with \u2228 is \u222a (union), \u2227 is \u2229 (intersection), \u00ac is a\u2192ac\n(complement with respect to U, ie ac=U\u2216a), 0 is \u2205, and 1 is U.\n\nExterior algebra is related to set algebra. If we set \u2205\u21921, U\u2192\u03c9, \u222a\u2192\u2227, and\nac\u2192\u22c6a, then these axioms are clearly similar:\n\n\u03b1\u2227(\u03b2\u2227\u03b3)\u03b1\u2227\u03b2\u03b1\u22271\u03b1\u2227\u22c6\u03b1=(\u03b1\u2227\u03b2)\u2227\u03b3=\u2212\u03b2\u2227\u03b3=\u03b1=\u03c9\n\nEach of these looks a lot like an axiom up above. Here are a few other\nobservations:\n\n  1. The wedge product of two pure multivectors \u03b1\u2227\u03b2 gives either the correct union of their basis components except that it\u2019s 0 in the case where there are duplicate vectors in each term, such as (xy)\u222a(yz)=xyz.\n  2. The interior product of two pure multivectors \u03b1\u22c5\u03b2 gives either the correct set subtraction of their basis components \u03b2\u2216\u03b1, except that it gives 0 in the case where every term in \u03b1 is not present in \u03b2, such as in (xy)\u2216(yz)=(x).\n  3. The naive way of linearizing the union operation, by just enforcing bilinearity via a(xy)+b(yz))\u222a(x)=a(xy)+b(xyz), is not well-behaved:\n\n     * It is not a graded algebra (the cardinalities don\u2019t add)\n     * As such, it cannot be made basis-invariant, because (cx)\u222a(cx)=c2x=cx.\n  4. There are a few obvious ways to replace the union with a related operation that might make it into a graded algebra:\n\n     * Concatenate lists, without removing duplicates (the tensor algebra)\n\n       * Problem: it requires picking some ordering on the underlying sets, but it does keep all the information, which could be mapped to a union afterwards. Plus, we can have duplicates in a set, which is weird.\n     * Concatenate sets, without removing duplicates (the symmetric algebra)\n\n       * Problem: we can have duplicates in a set. Still weird.\n     * Concatenate sets, removing duplicates (the exterior algebra)\n  5. The wedge product \u2227 has the wrong symbol, because it corresponds to \u2228 (\u201cor\u201d, \u201cjoin\u201d) in boolean algebra and \u222a (\u201cunion\u201d) in the set algebra. Whoops! Fortunately we can probably keep calling it the \u2018wedge\u2019 product either way.\n\nMaybe in order to \u201clinearize\u201d the set algebra in a useful way you have to\nadjust the operations so that they always respect grading on their arguments.\nThe union must always add cardinalities; set subtraction must always subtract\ncardinalities; intersection must do... something. And any time this rule is\nviolated, the result is 0 instead of what the set operation would give. This\nis certainly not a homomorphism of the algebras formed by \u222a or \u2229, and shortly,\nwhen we discuss exterior algebra\u2019s version of \u2018intersection\u2019, it will turn out\nthat the distributivity axioms of set algebra do not carry over and must be\nweakened. Nevertheless it all seems a bit helpful? We can kinda think of\nmultivectors as vectors of sets and intuit what identities should hold from\nthat fact, up to a sign or so.\n\nHere\u2019s the glossary:\n\n  * Boolean algebra\u2019s Or, And, Not are\n  * Lattice theory\u2019s Join, Meet, Complement, which are\n  * Set algebra\u2019s Union, Intersection, and Complement, which are related to\n  * Exterior Algebra\u2019s Wedge, Antiwedge (?), and Hodge Star\n\n(We should probably just call the Hodge Star the \u201ccomplement\u201d, anyway.\nMeanwhile, the exterior algebra version of intersection/meet doesn\u2019t have a\ngood name at all: it feels weird to call it the \u201cmeet\u201d without calling wedge\nproducts the \u201cjoin\u201d, but \u201cregressive product\u201d (Grassmann\u2019s name) isn\u2019t great\neither, and \u201cantiwedge\u201d sucks too. Overall \u201cmeet\u201d and \u201cjoin\u201d seem like the\nbest set of names. Maybe I\u2019ll use those in the future.)\n\nLet\u2019s round out our theory with the exterior-algebra version of\n\u201cintersection\u201d, which, for lack of a better name, we\u2019ll call the \u201cmeet\u201d.\n\n## 3\\. The Meet\n\nThe meet, denoted \u2228 and pronounced \u2018vee\u2019 if you want, is the linearization of\nset intersection \u2229. It\u2019s also occasionally called the \u201cantiwedge\u201d or the\n\u201cregressive product\u201d (because it reduces grades. these people also call \u2227 the\n\u2018progressive\u2019 product). It feels slightly strange to call it the \u2018meet\u2019 if we\ndon\u2019t also call \u2227 the \u2018join\u2019, so let\u2019s try to start doing that. I\u2019m\ncapitalizing it because I find it hard to read otherwise, since it\u2019s such an\nordinary word.\n\nThe meet is the dual of the wedge product with respect to the complement \u22c6:\n\n\u03b1\u2228\u03b2\u03b1\u2227\u03b2=\u22c6((\u22c6\u03b1)\u2227(\u22c6\u03b2))=\u22c6((\u22c6\u03b1)\u2228(\u22c6\u03b2))(1)\n\n(Compare to De Morgan\u2019s laws in set algebra: (a\u2227b)c=ac\u2228bc. We would write\nthese as \u22c6\u22121(\u03b1\u2227\u03b2)=\u22c6\u03b1\u2228\u22c6\u03b2.)\n\nThis definition is quite useable. It means that any wedge product on vectors\nhas a parallel equation on pseudovectors:\n\n(\u22c6x)\u2228(\u22c6y)(x)\u2227(y)=\u22c6(x\u2227y)=\u22c6((\u22c6x)\u2228(\u22c6y))\n\nIn general, this is what the meet does to grades:\n\nn\u2212p\u03b1\u2228n\u2212q\u03b2=n\u2212p\u2212q(\u03b1\u2228\u03b2)\n\nIt can be useful to think of these things as being \u2018graded modulo n\u2019:\n\u2212p\u03b1\u2228\u2212q\u03b2\u2261\u2212(p+q)(\u03b1\u2228\u03b2).\n\nThat said, Grassmann lumped \u2227 and \u2228 together into one operation that basically\nacted on grades modulo n and in my opinion it did not work very well.\n\nBecause (\u2227V,\u2228) is isomorphic to the exterior algebra (\u2227V,\u2227) under \u22c6, it is\nitself an exterior algebra, except that the \u2018vectors\u2019 are the pseudovectors\n\u2227n\u22121V and the product is \u2228. This algebra, which we call \u2228V, has exactly the\nsame relations as \u2227V, with \u03c9 as the identity and 1=\u22c6\u03c9 as the \u2018pseudoscalar\u2019.\nTaken together, the Join and Meet algebras are occasionally called the \u201cDouble\nAlgebra\u201d on V, which we might write as \u2227\u2228V.\n\nWhen \u2223\u03b1\u2223+\u2223\u03b2\u2223=n, the meet is just a scalar product, and some authors use this\nto define the inner and interior products:^1\n\n^1The Barnabei/Brini/ Rota paper cited above gives a brief history: when Elie\nCartan imported the exterior algebra into the theory of differential forms, he\ndropped the meet in favor of the interior product. They disagree with this on\nthe grounds that it loses out on elegant structure, and prefer to define the\ninterior and inner products in terms of \u2228. Apparently this also performs\nbetter in settings where there is no canonical inner product? Not sure I\nbelieve that, though. \u21a9\n\nk\u03b1\u2228n\u2212k\u03b2=\u22c6(\u22c6\u03b1\u2227(\u22c6\u03b2))=\u22c6\u27e8\u22c6\u03b1,\u03b2\u27e9\u03c9=\u27e8\u22c6\u03b1,\u03b2\u27e9\n\nWe can also define the interior product and meet in terms of each other:^2\n\n^2A more symmetric form for the first: \u03b1\u22c5(\u22c6\u03b2)=\u22c6\u22121\u03b2\u2228\u22c6\u22121\u03b1. The duality (1)\nclearly means that \u03b1\u2228\u03b2=(\u22121)\u2223\u22c6\u03b1\u2223\u2223\u22c6\u03b2\u2223\u03b2\u2228\u03b1, which immediately leads to\n\u03b1\u22c5(\u22c6\u03b2)=(\u22121)\u2223\u22c6\u03b1\u2223\u2223\u22c6\u03b2\u2223\u03b2\u22c5(\u22c6\u03b1), which is a much cleaner derivation of an identity\nfrom my previous post. \u21a9\n\n\u03b1\u22c5\u03b2\u03b1\u2228\u03b2=\u22c62\u03b2\u2228(\u22c6\u22121\u03b1)=(\u22c6\u03b2)\u22c5(\u22c62\u03b1)\n\nUnfortunately, meets are confusing. The operation almost acts like\nintersection, but is very dependent on the grade of the space you\u2019re working\nin. It\u2019s only nonzero when the grades of its arguments sum to \u2265n, which is\neasily seen from the duality (1):\n\np\u03b1\u2228q\u03b2=\u23a9\u23a8\u23a7p+q\u2212n(\u03b1\u2228\u03b2)0 if p+q\u2265n if p+q<n\n\nAs a result, meets are mostly not useful as an intersection operation in\npractice, and an equation which gives a nonzero result in \u2227Rn may give zero in\n\u2227Rm>n.\n\nHere are some examples of Meets in R3:\n\nx\u2228y(x\u2227y)\u2228(y\u2227z)x\u2228(x\u2227y)x\u2228(y\u2227z)=\u22c6((x\u2227y)\u2227(z\u2227x))=0=\u22c6(z\u2227x)=y=\u22c6(y\u2227z\u2227z)=0=\u22c6(y\u2227z\u2227x)=1\n\nIn R4 with \u03c9=w\u2227x\u2227y\u2227z:\n\n(x\u2227y)\u2228(y\u2227z)(w\u2227x)\u2228(y\u2227z)(w\u2227x\u2227y)\u2228(z)=\u22c6(z\u2227w\u2227w\u2227x)=0=1=1\n\nIt\u2019s sort of computing intersections, but not very well. (x\u2227y)\u2228(y\u2227z)=y but\nx\u2228(x\u2227y)=0? What are we supposed to do with that? The reason is that, for the\nmeet to be nonzero, the result must contain an entire copy of \u03c9. For instance,\n(\u03b1)\u2228(\u22c6\u03b1\u2227\u03b2)\u221d\u03b2: the meet removes the \u03b1\u2227(\u22c6\u03b1)\u221d\u03c9 part, leaving a \u2018remainder\u2019 of \u00b1\u03b2.\nIt is way too much to keep track of.\n\n## 3\\. Problems\n\nThe \u2018exterior algebra as a linearization of set algebra\u2019 analogy is just not\nvery good.\n\nA few reasons: we know that \u03b1\u2227\u03b1=0 unless \u03b1\u2208\u22270V, yet a\u222aa=a. This means lots of\nidentities don\u2019t work. We might try work around this by saying: well,\nidentities from set algebra hold in exterior algebra so long as both sides are\nnonzero, which we could write as ==0. But it\u2019s still not true that \u03b1\u2227\u03b1==0\u03b1 in\nany sense \u2013 if it\u2019s a scalar it would be equal to \u2223\u03b1\u222321; otherwise it would be\nequal to 0.\n\nI tried for a long time to make it work and didn\u2019t get anywhere. It\u2019s just not\nthat useful to have set operations that kinda work but constantly give 0 in\nsneaky ways.\n\nThe analogy to set algebra was supposed to make everything simpler, but\ninstead we got a weird new operation and no simplicity at all. Guess we have\nto keep looking.\n\nMy other articles about Exterior Algebra:\n\n  0. Oriented Areas and the Shoelace Formula\n  1. Matrices and Determinants\n  2. The Inner product\n  3.

A more symmetric form for the first: \u03b1\u22c5(\u22c6\u03b2)=\u22c6\u22121\u03b2\u2228\u22c6\u22121\u03b1. The duality (1) clearly means that \u03b1\u2228\u03b2=(\u22121)\u2223\u22c6\u03b1\u2223\u2223\u22c6\u03b2\u2223\u03b2\u2228\u03b1, which immediately leads to \u03b1\u22c5(\u22c6\u03b2)=(\u22121)\u2223\u22c6\u03b1\u2223\u2223\u22c6\u03b2\u2223\u03b2\u22c5(\u22c6\u03b1), which is a much cleaner derivation of an identity from my previous post. \u21a9\n\n\u00ab Exterior Algebra Notes #4: The Interior Product\n\nExterior Algebra #6: Oriented Projective Geometry \u00bb\n\n\u25b2 Home\n\n", "frontpage": false}
