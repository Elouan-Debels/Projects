At their best, they keep entire organizations aligned,\nmotivated and supported. At least, that\u2019s the theory.\n\nAt the time of writing, Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang has 40 direct reports and\nfamously conducts no 1-on-1s, preferring group settings for all live\nconversation. Nvidia is wildly successful and boasts great scores on sites\nlike GlassDoor. So is Huang\u2019s approach the exception that proves the rule?\nWhat dark sorcery is at work here and what might we learn?\n\n###\n\nConvention Over Configuration\n\nWhen experts say \u201c1-on-1s are essential\u201d, what they hopefully mean to imply\nis...\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to achieve a bunch of very common, important goals in your\nbusiness, given that you have a \u2018typical\u2019 mix of people, roles, processes and\ncultural conventions, 1-on-1s are a reliably high-success-rate tool for\nachieving those goals.\u201d\n\nThis is the \u2018everything has tradeoffs\u2019 mindset that recognizes no initiative /\ntool lives in isolation. Just because 1-on-1s happen to be the best tool in\nmany circumstances, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the only approach that can / should\nwork. However in order to chart a different path, we need to unpack the things\n1-on-1s deliver and how we might achieve those things using different tools.\n\n###\n\nOutcomes Over Activity\n\nWhen we teach teams how to have effective 1-on-1s, we identify a number of\noutcomes that such meetings could theoretically achieve. Broadly, these break\ndown into 3 groups...\n\n  * Personal Connection: The fostering of mutual trust, respect, understanding and perhaps even fondness. This is the lifeblood of an organization that needs to face challenges together because people draw on such connections when things get tough.\n\n  * Growth Support: Every individual has a different sense of what self-actualization means to them. Tuning the support they get accordingly is vital to both their development and their retention within the organization.\n\n  * Driving Delivery: Giving advice, solving problems, making decisions and gathering status are all activities that are commonly practiced in 1-on-1s to keep things moving.\n\nNothing listed here is exclusively dependent on the 1-on-1 format. In fact, we\nwould even argue that a few of the items contained in the buckets above are\npoor uses of 1-on-1 time. Regardless, the three questions any leader who\u2019d\nlike to try Nvidia\u2019s model should ask themselves are...\n\n  * \u201cWhat set of rituals, artifacts and roles will we need if we want to achieve these outcomes without 1-on-1s?\u201d\n\n  * \u201cWhat will it cost to build and maintain that entire alternative team architecture?\u201d\n\n  * \u201cWhat new risks will be created?\u201d\n\n###\n\nRisky Business\n\nIf we look at some publicly available critical sentiments from Nvidia\nemployees, they talk about having to be in a lot of meetings. Any set of\nconventions that favors group settings for discussions carries the risk of\ncreating a meeting heavy culture. One of the things 1-on-1s do (and, indeed,\ncan overdo) is provide compartmentalization for discussions, keeping them\nrelevant to the people involved. Moving away from 1-on-1s means having to be\nvery deliberate about curating and facilitating discussions to keep things\ntight and focused.\n\nAnother obvious challenge with Huang\u2019s approach is that it selects very\nstrongly for certain kinds of temperament; interactive learners with a speak-\nthink-speak bias. By contrast, some people don\u2019t do well in even moderately\nsized group meetings and tend to be at their best 1-on-1 for certain kinds of\nconversation. There\u2019s no rule that says you have to have those kinds of people\nin your organization but if you create norms that exclude such people, you are\ntaking a bet on being able to thrive without them. This is another example of\na tradeoff that must be undertaken deliberately and thoughtfully.\n\nFinally, we have a benefit of 1-on-1s that is (hopefully) rarely needed but\noccasionally indispensable; a personal safety net. When someone is struggling\nin ways they don\u2019t feel able to talk about in a group setting, an\norganizational bias against 1-on-1s can make them less apt to reach out for\nhelp. This can be true even if managers have made it clear their door is open\nin such circumstances. \u201c1-on-1s are inefficient\u201d can quickly turn into \u201conly\ninefficient people want a 1-on-1\u201d in the team\u2019s list of cultural assumptions.\n\n###\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nGiven everything discussed, we default to recommending regular, effectively\ndesigned and delivered 1-on-1s for most organizations. You\u2019ll need to reflect\non the questions above to decide whether they are the best tool for your\norganization. If you\u2019d like to dive a little deeper into the tradeoffs and\noptions, we\u2019d be happy to talk with you further.\n\n4\n\nShare this post\n\n#### 1-on-1s: Essential or Overrated?\n\npeoplestorming.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 PeopleStorming\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
