The cellular network orchestrates\ninteractions with every organ and tissue to carry out an impossibly long list\nof functions that scientists are still working to understand. All that\ncomplexity limits our ability to predict which patients will respond to\ntreatments and which ones might suffer debilitating side effects.\n\nThe issue often leads pharmaceutical companies to stop developing drugs that\ncould help certain patients, halting clinical trials even when drugs show\npromising results for some people.\n\nNow, Immunai is helping to predict how patients will respond to treatments by\nbuilding a comprehensive map of the immune system. The company has assembled a\nvast database it calls AMICA, that combines multiple layers of gene and\nprotein expression data in cells with clinical trial data to match the right\ndrugs to the right patients.\n\n\u201cOur starting point was creating what I call the Google Maps for the immune\nsystem,\u201d Immunai co-founder and CEO Noam Solomon says. \u201cWe started with\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing, and over time we\u2019ve added more and more \u2018omics\u2019:\ngenomics, proteomics, epigenomics, all to measure the immune system\u2019s cellular\nexpression and function, to measure the immune environment holistically. Then\nwe started working with pharmaceutical companies and hospitals to profile the\nimmune systems of patients undergoing treatments to really get to the root\nmechanisms of action and resistance for therapeutics.\u201d\n\nImmunai\u2019s big data foundation is a result of its founders\u2019 unique background.\nSolomon and co-founder Luis Voloch \u201913, SM \u201915 hold degrees in mathematics and\ncomputer science. In fact, Solomon was a postdoc in MIT\u2019s Department of\nMathematics at the time of Immunai\u2019s founding.\n\nSolomon frames Immunai\u2019s mission as stopping the decades-long divergence of\ncomputer science and the life sciences. He believes the single biggest factor\ndriving the explosion of computing has been Moore\u2019s Law \u2014 our ability to\nexponentially increase the number of transistors on a chip over the past 60\nyears. In the pharmaceutical industry, the reverse is happening: By one\nestimate, the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubles every nine years.\nThe phenomenon has been dubbed Eroom\u2019s Law (\u201cEroom\u201d for \u201cMoore\u201d spelled\nbackward).\n\nSolomon sees the trend eroding the case for developing new drugs, with huge\nconsequences for patients.\n\n\u201cWhy should pharmaceutical companies invest in discovery if they won\u2019t get a\nreturn on investment?\u201d Solomon asks. \u201cToday, there\u2019s only a 5 to 10 percent\nchance that any given clinical trial will be successful. What we\u2019ve built\nthrough a very robust and granular mapping of the immune system is a chance to\nimprove the preclinical and clinical stages of drug development.\u201d\n\nA change in plans\n\nSolomon entered Tel Aviv University when he was 14 and earned his bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in computer science by 19. He earned two PhDs in Israel, one in\ncomputer science and the other in mathematics, before coming to MIT in 2017 as\na postdoc to continue his mathematical research career.\n\nThat year Solomon met Voloch, who had already earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s\ndegrees in math and computer science from MIT. But the researchers were soon\nexposed to a problem that would take them out of their comfort zones and\nchange the course of their careers.\n\nVoloch\u2019s grandfather was receiving a cocktail of treatments for cancer at the\ntime. The cancer went into remission, but he suffered terrible side effects\nthat caused him to stop taking his medication.\n\nVoloch and Solomon began wondering if their expertise could help patients like\nVoloch\u2019s grandfather.\n\n\u201cWhen we realized we could make an impact, we made the difficult decision to\nstop our academic pursuits and start a new journey,\u201d Solomon recalls. \u201cThat\nwas the starting point for Immunai.\u201d\n\nVoloch and Solomon soon partnered with Immunai scientific co-founders Ansu\nSatpathy, a researcher at Stanford University at the time, and Danny Wells, a\nresearcher at the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. Satpathy and\nWells had shown that single-cell RNA sequencing could be used to gain insights\ninto why patients respond differently to a common cancer treatment.\n\nThe team began analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data published in\nscientific papers, trying to link common biomarkers with patient outcomes.\nThen they integrated data from the United Kingdom\u2019s Biobank public health\ndatabase, finding they were able to improve their models\u2019 predictions. Soon\nthey were incorporating data from hospitals, academic research institutions,\nand pharmaceutical companies, analyzing information about the structure,\nfunction, and environment of cells \u2014 multiomics \u2014 to get a clearer picture of\nimmune activity.\n\n\u201cSingle cell sequencing gives you metrics you can measure in thousands of\ncells, where you can look at 20,000 different genes, and those metrics give\nyou an immune profile,\u201d Solomon explains. \u201cWhen you measure all of that over\ntime, especially before and after getting therapy, and compare patients who do\nrespond with patients who don\u2019t, you can apply machine learning models to\nunderstand why.\u201d\n\nThose data and models make up AMICA, what Immunai calls the world\u2019s largest\ncell-level immune knowledge base. AMICA stands for Annotated Multiomic Immune\nCell Atlas. It analyzes single cell multiomic data from almost 10,000 patients\nand bulk-RNA data from 100,000 patients across more than 800 cell types and\n500 diseases.\n\nAt the core of Immunai\u2019s approach is a focus on the immune system, which other\ncompanies shy away from because of its complexity.\n\n\u201cWe don't want to be like other groups that are studying mainly tumor\nmicroenvironments,\u201d Solomon says. \u201cWe look at the immune system because the\nimmune system is the common denominator. It\u2019s the one system that is\nimplicated in every disease, in your body\u2019s response to everything that you\nencounter, whether it's a viral infection or bacterial infection or a drug\nthat you are receiving \u2014 even how you are aging.\u201d\n\nTurning data into better treatments\n\nImmunai has already partnered with some of the largest pharmaceutical\ncompanies in the world to help them identify promising treatments and set up\ntheir clinical trials for success. Immunai's insights can help partners make\ncritical decisions about treatment schedules, dosing, drug combinations,\npatient selection, and more.\n\n\u201cEveryone is talking about AI, but I think the most exciting aspect of the\nplatform we have built is the fact that it's vertically integrated, from wet\nlab to computational modeling with multiple iterations,\u201d Solomon says. \u201cFor\nexample, we may do single-cell immune profiling of patient samples, then we\nupload that data to the cloud and our computational models come up with\ninsights, and with those insights we do in vitro or in vivo validation to see\nif our models are right and iteratively improve them.\u201d\n\nUltimately Immunai wants to enable a future where lab experiments can more\nreliably turn into impactful new recommendations and treatments for patients.\n\n\u201cScientists can cure nearly every type of cancer, but only in mice,\u201d Solomon\nsays. \u201cIn preclinical models we know how to cure cancer. In human beings, in\nmost cases, we still don't. To overcome that, most scientists are looking for\nbetter ex vivo or in vivo models. Our approach is to be more agnostic as to\nthe model system, but feed the machine with more and more data from multiple\nmodel systems. We\u2019re demonstrating that our algorithms can repeatedly beat the\ntop benchmarks in identifying the top preclinical immune features that match\nto patient outcomes.\u201d\n\n### Share this news article on:\n\n  * X\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Print\n\n## Related Links\n\n  * Immunai\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * Startups\n  * Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E)\n  * Cells\n  * Disease\n  * Drug development\n  * Cancer\n  * Medicine\n  * Mathematics\n  * Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (eecs)\n  * School of Engineering\n  * Alumni/ae\n  * Data\n\n## Related Articles\n\n### Unlocking mRNA\u2019s cancer-fighting potential\n\n### Reflecting on a decade of SuperUROP at MIT\n\n### MIT conference showcases undergraduate research\n\n## More MIT News\n\n### New AI method captures uncertainty in medical images\n\nBy providing plausible label maps for one medical image, the Tyche machine-\nlearning model could help clinicians and researchers capture crucial\ninformation.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### MIT-Mexico Program fosters cross-border collaboration\n\nFor two decades, MIT-Mexico has funded student internships and teaching, as\nwell as faculty research collaborations.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### With inspiration from \u201cTetris,\u201d MIT researchers develop a better radiation\ndetector\n\nThe device, based on simple tetromino shapes, could determine the direction\nand distance of a radiation source, with fewer detector pixels.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### QS World University Rankings rates MIT No. 1 in 11 subjects for 2024\n\nThe Institute also ranks second in five subject areas.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### Tackling cancer at the nanoscale\n\nIn MIT\u2019s 2024 Killian Lecture, chemical engineer Paula Hammond described her\ngroundbreaking work on nanoparticles designed to attack tumor cells.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n### A faster, better way to prevent an AI chatbot from giving toxic responses\n\nResearchers create a curious machine-learning model that finds a wider variety\nof prompts for training a chatbot to avoid hateful or harmful output.\n\nRead full story \u2192\n\n  * More news on MIT News homepage \u2192\n\n## More about MIT News at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThis website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office\nof Communications.\n\n### News by Schools/College:\n\n  * School of Architecture and Planning\n  * School of Engineering\n  * School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences\n  * MIT Sloan School of Management\n  * School of Science\n  * MIT Schwarzman College of Computing\n\n### Resources:\n\n  * About the MIT News Office\n  * MIT News Press Center\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Press Inquiries\n  * Filming Guidelines\n  * RSS Feeds\n\n### Tools:\n\n  * Subscribe to MIT Daily/Weekly\n  * Subscribe to press releases\n  * Submit campus news\n  * Guidelines for campus news contributors\n  * Guidelines on generative AI\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA,\nUSA\n\nRecommended Links:\n\n  * Visit\n  * Map (opens in new window)\n  * Events (opens in new window)\n  * People (opens in new window)\n  * Careers (opens in new window)\n  * Contact\n  * Privacy\n  * Accessibility\n  *     * Social Media Hub\n    * MIT on X\n    * MIT on Facebook\n    * MIT on YouTube\n    * MIT on Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": false}
