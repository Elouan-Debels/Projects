Although the\nrelationship of certain heavenly bodies to time of day and terrestrial\ndirections had been known since ancient times, the first two decades of the\nsixteenth century saw the rigorous application of astronomy and mathematics to\nnavigation. The new learning met the New World.Tools such as an hourglass, a\nquadrant, a compass and a nautical chart were vital for effective\nnavigation.Vicki WallaceNavigation is based largely on the spherical\ncoordinates latitude -angular distance north or south of the equator - and\nlongitude - angular distance east or west of a generally accepted reference\nlocation, such as the Greenwich Observatory. Finding longitude requires\ncomparing local time, measured by a heavenly body, with the local time at a\nreference location, kept by a clock. Mechanical time-pieces existed in the\nElizabethan era, but until the late eighteenth century they had to be\ncorrected frequently by sun sightings and were therefore almost useless aboard\nship. Measuring latitude, on the other hand, does not require an accurate\ntime-piece. Refinement of instruments enabled sixteenth-century mariners to\ndetermine latitude with reasonable accuracy. Latitude was therefore extremely\nimportant to Elizabethan navigation.Unable to use the latitude-longitude\nsystem to the fullest, sixteenth-century navigators supplemented latitude with\na rho-theta (distance-and-bearing) system - dead (from deduced) reckoning.\nBeginning at a known or assumed position, the navigator measured, as best he\ncould, the heading and speed of the ship, the speeds of the ocean currents and\nthe leeward (downwind) drift of the ship, and the time spent on each heading.\nFrom this information he could compute the course he had made and the distance\nhe had covered. Dead reckoning, through educated guesswork, is often very\naccurate. It is still practiced on ships and aircraft, and it lies at the\nheart of modern doppler and inertial navigational equipment. Errors tend to\naccumulate in dead reckoning, so its accuracy depends in part on the length of\nthe voyage and the ability of the navigator to use latitude and other\ninformation to limit error. But above all else, dead reckoning depends on\nreliable instruments.Instruments For Measuring LatitudeThe celestial globe was\na mounted sphere depicting the heavens instead of the earth. While many were\ndesigned to grace private libraries, some were used as navigational\ninstruments. With the introduction by Gerardus Mercator, in 1569, of\npractical, affordable sea charts, on which were shown parallels of latitude\nand meridians of longitude, the costly and delicate celestial globe gradually\nfell out of use.It could be difficult to use an astrolabe when on a ship's\ndeck. It required precision that could be difficult on a rocking ship.Vicki\nWallaceThe astrolabe was used to determine latitude by measuring the angle\nbetween the horizon and Polaris, also called the North Star, the Pole Star, or\nStella Maris (Star of the Sea). Polaris was the preferred star for measuring\nlatitude because it is less than one degree from the north celestial pole (the\npoint in the heavens directly above the geographic north pole).The astrolabe\nis an instrument of some antiquity; Persian models dating as far back as the\neleventh century have been found, and Chaucer wrote a Treatise on it in the\nlate 1300s. By the Elizabethan era it consisted of a large brass ring fitted\nwith an alidade or sighting rule. The user held the astrolabe by a loop at the\ntop, turned the alidade so that he could sight the star along its length, and\nread the altitude off the scale engraved on the ring - difficult tasks to\nperform on the deck of a heaving ship. The consequences of imprecise\nmeasurement are serious (a latitude reading just one degree off produces an\nerror in position of 60 nautical miles), so mariners often used the astrolabe\nin pairs, one to sight along the alidade, the other to steady the instrument\nand take readings. On shore, however, the astrolabe was easier to use and more\naccurate.The quadrant, shaped like a quarter-circle, was another hand-held\ninstrument of wood or brass. The user measured the altitude of Polaris by\nsighting through a peephole and taking a reading where a short plumb line\nintersected the scale on the outer edge of the arc.The cross-staff had\ndeveloped from the tenth-century Arab kamal. It consisted of a square staff\n3.5-4 feet in length, bearing a scale, with four sliding cross-pieces or\ntransversals of graduated lengths. Only one transversal was used at a time,\nits selection being based upon the height of the heavenly body in the sky -\nthe higher the body, the longer the transversal. The user held on end of the\nstaff to his eye, then slid the transversal onto the far end and moved it back\nand forth until its upper and lower edges seemed to touch, respectively, the\nobserved body and the horizon. The location of the transversal on the scale\nwas converted by a table into degrees of latitude.Polaris is often obscured by\nclouds, fog, or daylight, and it is below the horizon for anyone in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. Darkness often makes the horizon hard to find. So\nnavigators learned to use the astrolabe, quadrant, and cross-staff with the\nsun. A piece of smoked glass was frequently used to keep the user from\nblinding himself. Under lock and key, for use by the captain and pilot only,\nwere highly prized declination tables or astronomical charts showing\ncalculated heights of the sun above the equator at noon for every day of the\nyear.The Magnetic CompassThe foregoing instruments provided invaluable\ninformation, but their use depended on the visibility of heavenly bodies. As a\nresult, mariners relied on the magnetic compass, an instrument developed,\nprobably independently, by Chinese in the eleventh century and Europeans in\nthe twelfth. Day or night, fair weather or foul, Northern or Southern\nhemisphere, the compass always points more or less north. At first compasses\nseem to have been used mainly to measure wind direction, but mariners soon\nfound them much more beneficial when used for finding headings.A typical\nsixteenth-century compass consisted of a large magnetized needle fastened to\nthe underside of a circular card on which the several directions were drawn.\nThe compass rose, as it was sometimes called, usually had thirty-two points\n11.25 degrees apart - north, north by east, north by northeast, and so on.\n(Sailors learned early in their careers to \"box the compass,\" that is, recite\nall the points in order.) The needle was pivoted on a fine brass pin to enable\nit to swing freely. The compass card was suspended by gimbals (concentric\nmounting rings), which allowed the card to remain level regardless of the\nmotion of the ship. The mechanism was kept in an open-topped box attached to a\nsmall cupboard called a bittacle (later binnacle), which was fixed to the deck\nin front of the helm. A lodestone, or piece of naturally magnetic iron ore,\nwas used to re-magnetize the compass needle.Christopher Columbus said that the\ncompass \"always seeks the truth.\" Unlike the modern gyroscopic compass,\nhowever, the magnetic compass does not always seek true north. The magnetic\npole is not at the top of the world, but an ever-changing distance away in the\nCanadian Arctic. Local variations in the magnetic field of the earth produce\ndifferent errors at different spots. This fact was recognized in the fifteenth\ncentury. The North Star gives a good approximation of true north, so compass\nvariation was easy to measure even in the Elizabethan era. Instructions for an\nAtlantic voyage planned by Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1582 list many pieces of\nnavigational gear, including \"An instrument for the variation of the compass.\"\nIn his \"Briefe and True Report\" (1588), Thomas Harriot, chief scientist for\nthe Lane colony (1585-1586), mentions \"Mathematicall instruments,\" which\nundoubtedly included such a device. Some mariners mounted the needle on the\ncompass card so as to take local compass variation into account and make the\ncard indicate true north. This practice caused problems, especially when\nmariners tried to sail unfamiliar vessels or when coasting vessels made\ntransoceanic voyages. (Compasses adjusted for the easterly variation found in\nGreat Britain, for example, gave unsatisfactory readings in parts of North\nAmerica with westerly variation.) Using several interchangeable cards with\nneedles mounted at different angles for different degrees of variation did\nlittle to reduce confusion.Instruments For Measuring TimeAccurate time is\nessential to dead reckoning. Water-clocks (clepsydras) and portable sundials\nsuffered obvious disadvantages aboard ship, so the sandglass or hourglass was\nthe timepiece most often used in navigation. The most common glasses were the\nfour-hour and half-hour sizes. Days at sea were divided into six four-hour\nshifts or watches. A ship's boy carefully tended the half-hour glass, turning\nit as soon as the sand had run through and calling out or striking a bell for\nall aboard to hear. At the end of four hours, he turned the four-hour glass.\n(Hence the system of bells and watches still used aboard many vessels.) The\ntexture of the sand could affect its rate of flow, as could condensation\nwithin the glass, so several glasses were used together for accuracy.The glass\nwas used in combination with the log, a piece of wood attached to a line\nknotted at uniform intervals. A sailor heaved the log from the stern of the\nship and let the line pay out freely as the ship pulled away. When the sailor\nfelt the first knot pass through his fingers, he shouted a signal to another\nsailor, who turned a one-minute glass. The first sailor counted aloud the\nnumber of knots that passed until the sand ran out. A timer of one minute\n(one-sixtieth of an hour), knots spaced one-sixtieth of a nautical mile apart,\nand simple arithmetic easily gave the speed of the ship in nautical miles per\nhour (\"knots\").The nocturnal consisted of two concentric plates of brass or\nwood, the larger divided into twelve equal parts corresponding to the months\nof the year, the smaller into twenty-four parts corresponding to hours of the\nday. By lining up a sighting mechanism with Polaris or certain stars in Ursa\nMajor or Ursa Minor, the user could determine the time of night with\nreasonable accuracy.Other ToolsCharts not only gave the mariner an idea of\nwhere he was going, but also a means of plotting his past and present\npositions. Cartographers and mariners endured many of the same problems, such\nas inability to determine precise longitude. Consequently, most sixteenth-\ncentury charts were not very accurate by modern standards. To make matters\nworse, cartographers often copied from one another, used information from\nunreliable sources, and relied on their own imaginations to fill in gaps in\ncoverage.The traverse board was used to approximate the course run by a ship\nduring a watch. It consisted of a circular piece of wood on which the compass\npoints had been painted. Eight small holes were evenly spaced along the radius\nto each point, and eight small pegs were attached with string to the center of\nthe board. Every half-hour one of the pegs was stuck into the next succeeding\nhole for the compass point closest to the heading the ship had maintained\nduring that half hour. At the end of that watch, a general course was\ndetermined from the position of the pegs. With speed information from the long\nand line, the traverse board served as a crude dead-reckoning computer\nreminiscent of those used to this day aboard aircraft.Used to find depth and\nsea-bed characteristics, the lead and line was an ancient, but highly useful\nnavigational aid. It consisted of a sounding lead attached to a line with\nevenly spaced knots or bits of colored cloth worked into it. The lead was\ntossed overboard and allowed to sink to the sea floor. Each mark was\ndistinctive, and the distance between successive marks was constant; so water\ndepth could easily be measured (\"by the mark\") or estimated (\"by the deep\").\nWhen hauled aboard, the lead, by virtue of tallow packed into a small\ndepression in its bottom, brought up a sample of the sea bed, useful in\nfinding a safe anchorage.Albeit not a navigational instrument, the boatswain's\npipe was a tool of great value. This peculiarly shaped whistle was used by the\nboatswain (the contraction bos'n was not used in the 16th century) to pipe\norders throughout the ship. Its high-pitched sound was usually audible, even\nabove the howling of the wind, to crewmen working high in the rigging.The\nship's log contained a record of courses, speeds, soundings, and other\nrelevant information. A good log was sufficiently accurate and comprehensive\nto allow the navigator to check his dead reckoning.Credits: Text by Olivia\nIsil; edited and expanded by lebame houston and Wynne Dough Illustrations:\nVicki WallaceGo to Unit 2 main pageGo to Roanoke Revisited main page  \n---  \n  \nLast updated: April 14, 2015\n\n### Success\n\nThank you.
