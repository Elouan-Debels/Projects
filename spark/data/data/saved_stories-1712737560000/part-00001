State hasn't been\ntracking\n\nAn estimated 171,000 people are homeless in California, which amounts to\nroughly 30% of all of the homeless people in the U.S.\n\nByTR\u00c2N NGUY\u1ec4N\n\nWednesday, April 10, 2024 1:14AM\n\nState audit finds San Jose not doing enough to assess the cost-effectiveness\nof its homelessness programs.\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California spent $24 billion to tackle homelessness over\na five-year period but didn't consistently track the outcomes or effectiveness\nof its programs, according to state audit released Tuesday.\n\nThe report attempts to assess how effectively the state and local cities have\nbeen spending billions of dollars to address the ongoing homelessness crisis\nin California.\n\nAn estimated 171,000 people are homeless in California, which amounts to\nroughly 30% of all of the homeless people in the U.S. Despite the roughly $24\nbillion spent on homeless and housing programs during the 2018-2023 fiscal\nyears, the problem didn't improve in many cities.\n\nAmong other things, the report found that the California Interagency Council\non Homelessness, which is responsible for coordinating agencies and allocating\nresources for homelessness programs, stopped tracking spending on programs and\ntheir outcomes in 2021 despite the continuous funding from the state. It also\nfailed to develop a collect and evaluate outcome data of these programs due to\nthe lack of a consistent method.\n\nWith makeshift tents lining streets and disrupting businesses in communities\nacross the state, homelessness has become one of the most frustrating issues\nin California.\n\nThe report notes that some data regarding the number of program participants\nand bed inventory in the state system might not be accurate or reliable.\n\nThe council, which lawmakers created to help the state deal with its\nhomelessness problem, also has only reported on homelessness spending once\nsince its creation in 2017, according to the report.\n\nWithout reliable and recent data on its spending, \"the state will continue to\nlack complete and timely information about the ongoing costs and associated\noutcomes of its homelessness programs,\" the audit contends.\n\nCalifornia funds more than 30 programs to tackle homelessness. The audit\nassesses five initiatives and finds only two of them - the efforts to turn\nhotel and motel rooms into housing and housing-related support programs - are\n\"likely cost-effective.\" The remaining programs, which received collectively\n$9.4 billion since 2020, did not have enough data to be fully assessed, the\nreport says.\n\nThe state auditor also reviewed homelessness spending in two major cities, San\nJose and San Diego, and found both failed to effectively track revenues and\nspending due to the lack of spending plans.\n\nReport a correction or typo\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 by The Associated Press.
