The sunlight split against the puffs to create a\nbeautiful rainbow, but it was a nuisance for the more than 70 onlookers.\n\nGranted they wanted the sun to be covered up, but by the moon, not a cloud.\n\n\u201cGot to get that cloud out of there. Move, cloud,\u201d said Toby Dittrich, a\nphysics professor at Portland Community College.\n\nFor him, the eclipse isn\u2019t about the pictures of an occluded sun \u2014 although\nthat\u2019s enough for millions of other eclipse viewers gathering under its path\nfrom Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico, to Canada. Instead, he chose the outskirts of this\nsmall Mexican town because it was at the center of the eclipse shadow,\nproviding 4 minutes and 30 seconds of totality, enough to understand our\nuniverse like never before.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDittrich, fellow physicists and student researchers were planning to run one\nof the most famous astronomical experiments in history \u2014 one that proved\nAlbert Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity. It showed how our massive sun\nbends starlight around it, showing that space-time must be curved instead of\nflat as Isaac Newton had predicted. Since it was performed with rudimentary\ninstruments in 1919, though, scientists have run only a limited number of\nloose follow-on tests.\n\nDittrich wanted to do better \u2014 and had the equipment for it. But in addition\nto the pesky cloud, there was another problem.\n\nSix minutes before the eclipse, the students at telescope station No. 4 called\nfor help. Its alignment was off, perhaps because of a faulty mount.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to save the station!\u201d said their professor, Daniel Borrero\nEcheverry, shooing away the gathering crowd.\n\nWith a minute before totality, Borrero Echeverry was still frantically working\nat the telescope station. And the cloud was still there.\n\nPlanning to retire in seven weeks, Dittrich had been chasing this eclipse data\nfor eight years. \u201cNo one really believes that [Einstein\u2019s theory] isn\u2019t true\nbecause of theoretical calculations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no one has actually\nsatisfactorily proven it.\u201d\n\nNow, he was nervous he wouldn\u2019t either.\n\n###\n\n105 years before this eclipse\n\nThe inspiration for Dittrich\u2019s 2024 experiment is traced back to more than a\ncentury ago. A 36-year-old Einstein, yet to reach major stardom, published a\nradical new idea in 1915 on how gravity worked.\n\nPreviously, Newton proposed that gravity occurred in a flat, uniform space.\nBut in Einstein\u2019s universe, space and time (which are inextricably linked\ntogether) are curved, getting pushed, pulled, stretched and warped by matter.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cIf you get really close to really massive things, things get weird,\u201d said\nBorrero Echeverry, a physics professor at Willamette University in Salem, Ore.\n\nEinstein did the math to prove his theory, but he suggested one way of\nmeasuring it in the real world would be by recording the position of the stars\nclose to the sun when the sun is out and compare it to when it\u2019s absent. It\u2019s\ndifficult to image stars in broad daylight because the sun washes them out,\nthough \u2014 unless a total solar eclipse blocks the sun\u2019s surface, allowing\nscientists to see details along its outer edge.\n\nEinstein\u2019s general relativity theory predicted that the massive sun should\nbend the light of surrounding stars by about twice as much as predicted per\nNewton\u2019s theory \u2014 a change too small to detect with a human eye but\npotentially visible with telescopes at that time.\n\nEnter British astronomers Sir Arthur Eddington and Frank Dyson. In 1919, they\nhauled their instruments from Britain to northern Brazil and West Africa to\nmeasure starlight during a total solar eclipse. They captured a total of 14\nstars that showed the light deflection that Einstein predicted, although the\nmargin of error was large.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nNonetheless, they proclaimed Einstein was correct, launching the physicist\ninto the mainstream celebrity status that we know today. \u201cEINSTEIN THEORY\nTRIUMPHS,\u201d the New York Times wrote on its front page.\n\nThis eclipse, Dittrich, Borrero Echeverry and a handful of student and faculty\nresearchers geared up to redo the 1919 Eddington experiment in unmatched\ndetail with better ground telescopes and thousands of sky images. They\nspecifically want to measure stars extremely close to the sun\u2019s edge \u2014 the\n\u201cforbidden zone\u201d where they often get washed out by the bright sunlight.\n\n###\n\n7 years to the eclipse\n\nThis is no easy experiment. Over the years, several research teams have tried\nto re-create it, but they either failed, produced too large margins of error\nor didn\u2019t capture enough data.\n\nDittrich and fellow physicist Richard Berry tried in August 2017, but it\u2019s not\nsomething Dittrich really brags about. While the data set was good, the\ncalibration of his telescopes were off. His margin of error ended up to be 50\npercent, more than the original Eddington experiment. He attempted the\nexperiment again during a total solar eclipse in Chile in December 2020, but\nrain and clouds got in the way.\n\nSatellite missions and radio telescopes have made extremely precise\nmeasurements of starlight deflection over the past few decades, but none of\nthese expensive projects imaged stars in Dittrich\u2019s coveted forbidden zone.\n\nThe most promising Eddington experiment to date, by physicist and amateur\nastronomer Don Bruns, managed to capture 40 stars in the forbidden zone during\nthe 2017 eclipse.\n\nEquipped with 13 high-resolution telescopes with cameras deployed across\nMexico and Texas, Dittrich\u2019s 2024 team of student and faculty researchers\ncould collect millions of data points that would offer a much sharper picture\nof this elusive area than ever before: They expected to image 200,000 stars.\n\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re painting a picture of a tree and all you have is a brown\ntrunk, said Dittrich. More data from the forbidden zone would be like filling\nin details about that tree\u2019s bark.\n\n###\n\n7 days to the eclipse\n\nTraveling in his 1973 Volvo station wagon, Dittrich hauled a 10-foot trailer\ncarrying about 800 pounds of equipment: tools, chairs, tables, laptops,\ncameras and five telescopes worth $11,000 total in boxes he custom-made.\n\nCrossing the border into Mexico, Dittrich became scared that a federal officer\nwho pulled him over might confiscate all that equipment \u2014 after all, the same\nthing happened to Eddington in 1914 en route to Crimea to conduct his\nexperiment during World War I.\n\nThe officer let him through, not without taking the pesos out of Dittrich\u2019s\nwallet and a handful of eclipse glasses.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThen fifty miles from El Salto, Dittrich\u2019s Volvo broke down under the weight\nof the trailer and equipment. His car was towed to the town. He\u2019ll have to\npick it up in June, after he retires.\n\n###\n\n5 days to the eclipse\n\nOnce at their destination, an upscale neighborhood complex about 20 minutes\naway from El Salto, the team unloaded their boxes.\n\nIt took them about five full days at the site to prepare for the approximately\n4 minutes and 30 seconds of full totality, not counting the months to years of\npreparation beforehand.\n\nThey mounted the telescopes, connected battery packs and upgraded the software\nto control their instruments and analyze the data. They assembled solar\nfilters made from round cardboard oatmeal containers and galaxy-designed duct\ntape (totaling less than $20) to place over the expensive telescopes so the\ninstruments wouldn\u2019t fry as they stared at the sun.\n\nThen it was time to work out any kinks before the big show. Telescopes that\nwere supposed to autonomously point to the North Star moved straight to\nground: instrument error. Someone bumped a telescope, so it needed to be\nrecalibrated: human error. The eclipse was hidden by clouds: an Earth error.\n\nSixteen hours before the eclipse, all five telescopes were detecting the\nstarlight deflection to an accuracy of 0.05 arcseconds \u2014 a promising result\nthat pointed to this being the most accurate Eddington experiment ever\nconducted.\n\nNow, they just had to wait until 12:10 p.m. Central on Monday to see if it\nworked.\n\n###\n\nThe countdown to totality\n\nAbout two minutes before, Oliva Schutz, a third-year student at Willamette\nUniversity on a telescope station, was feeling jittery.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the one pressing the button on the computer,\u201d fellow student Sam\nJeffe told her. \u201cIf someone [messes] things up, it\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nBorrero Echeverry had given up fixing telescope #3 at this point. He joined a\ngroup of at least 50 locals, who came to experience totality. Born and raised\nin Columbia, he began the countdown in Spanish.\n\n\u201cSiete! Seis! Cinco! Cuatro! Tres! Dos! Uno!\u201d the crowd shouted in unison.\n\nThe sky darkened, and a glowing halo appeared in the sky. The crowd cheered,\nwhistled and clapped.\n\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d said Jeffe. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear around there!\u201d The cloud appeared to\nbe gone to human eyes.\n\n\u201cStars!\u201d another voice yelled.\n\nTwo bright dots appeared on either side of the eclipse, Jupiter and Venus.\nBorrero Echeverry spotted another bright dot, perhaps an eruption from the\nsun. On the ground, a sunset encircled the group.\n\n\u201cCheck your screens!\u201d Cesar Delgado, a research assistant, said to Jeffe. Data\nstarted rolling in. The telescopes worked hard for four and a half minutes.\n\nThen Borrero Echeverry started another group chant to mark the end: \u201cCinco!\nCuatro! Tres! Dos! Uno!\u201d\n\nAnd just like that, totality was over.\n\n###\n\nAfter the eclipse\n\n\u201cIt was insane,\u201d said Maddie Strate, a first-year student at Willamette.\n\nWhile everyone was abuzz, the students in charge of telescope station No. 4\nsat quietly on the side. The team was unable to realign the telescope to the\nsun, only getting about 30 seconds of data.\n\n\u201cThese are man-made machines, and man-made machines make mistakes that you\ncan\u2019t do anything about,\u201d said Anna Hornbeck, a third-year physics major.\n\nThe seven telescopes in Texas also hit roadblocks. Clouds covered the eclipse.\n\nBut the four working telescopes in El Salto got tons of star data. It will\ntake time to see how many of those were in the forbidden zone, but preliminary\nresults look promising.\n\n\u201cI went through this monstrous trouble to get to Mexico, and it paid off,\u201d\nDittrich said.\n\nCompany\n\n* About The Post\n* Newsroom Policies & Standards\n* Diversity & Inclusion\n* Careers\n* Media & Community Relations\n* WP Creative Group\n* Accessibility Statement\n* Sitemap\n\nGet The Post\n\n* Become a Subscriber\n* Gift Subscriptions\n* Mobile & Apps\n* Newsletters & Alerts\n* Washington Post Live\n* Reprints & Permissions\n* Post Store\n* Books & E-Books\n* Print Archives (Subscribers Only)\n* Today\u2019s Paper\n* Public Notices\n* Coupons\n\nContact Us\n\n* Contact the Newsroom\n* Contact Customer Care\n* Contact the Opinions Team\n* Advertise\n* Licensing & Syndication\n* Request a Correction\n* Send a News Tip\n* Report a Vulnerability\n\nTerms of Use\n\n* Digital Products Terms of Sale\n* Print Products Terms of Sale\n* Terms of Service\n* Privacy Policy\n* Cookie Settings\n* Submissions & Discussion Policy\n* RSS Terms of Service\n* Ad Choices\n\nwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n\n  * washingtonpost.com\n  * \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post\n  * About The Post\n  * Contact the Newsroom\n  * Contact Customer Care\n  * Request a Correction\n  * Send a News Tip\n  * Report a Vulnerability\n  * Download the Washington Post App\n  * Policies & Standards\n  * Terms of Service\n  * Privacy Policy\n  * Cookie Settings\n  * Print Products Terms of Sale\n  * Digital Products Terms of Sale\n  * Submissions & Discussion Policy\n  * RSS Terms of Service\n  * Ad Choices\n  * Coupons\n\n", "frontpage": false}
