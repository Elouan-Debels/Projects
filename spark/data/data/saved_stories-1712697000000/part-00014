Maybe they\u2019re\nestranged from their family and have outlived all their friends. Maybe they\nfell into a life of drug addiction and lost all of their close connections.\nMaybe no next of kin can be found or they just happen to die in a life stage\nwhen they have no one around to attend their funeral. Whatever the reason,\nsome people's send-offs from earthly existence are purely legal affairs with\nno personal touches whatsoever.\n\nTwo decades ago, some poets in the Netherlands decided that was an\nunacceptable ending for a human life. In 2001, a poet named Bart Droog began\nattending the funerals of people who had no one to attend them and honoring\nthe dead with a poem based on whatever was known about their life. A year\nlater, Dutch poet and artist Frank Starik took the idea even further,\nlaunching The Lonely Funeral project to ensure that someone who cares\nconsciously acknowledges the life of a person who has died.\n\nThe idea was to create a network of poets who would find out whatever they\ncould about the person, write a custom poem about their life and read it at\ntheir funeral. As of 2018, over 300 \"lonely funerals\" had been attended by\npoets in Amsterdam and Antwerp (where Flemish poet Maarten Inghels launched a\nLonely Funeral project seven years after Starik's).\n\nThe Lonely Funeral project has continued to expand to other countries as well.\nScottish poet Andy Jackson has begun writing poems for \"lonely funerals\" and\nattending them in his hometown of Dundee and he hopes to expand the project to\nthe rest of Scotland.\n\n\"I feel everybody deserves something humane at the end of life\" he told the\nBBC. \"Nobody should be completely unmourned. If we want to live in humane\ncountry these are little things we can do for people. It becomes the job of\nthe community.\"\n\nA natural question is how the poets know what to write if the person was all\nalone.\n\n\"They would have a passport, some details from the police or from social\nservices, a photograph or some information about their life maybe,\" Jackson\nexplained to the BBC. \"Something that would give away something of who they\nwere that a poet then could use to form the basis of a piece of work that\nwould actually celebrate the real person\u2014not somebody you couldn't identify.\"\n\nStarik and Inghels have even published a book, The Lonely Funeral: Poets at\nthe Gravesides of the Forgotten, which includes poems for 31 forgotten lives\nand descriptions of their funerals\u2014a small piece of dignity offered to perfect\nstrangers.\n\nThere's perhaps nothing more beautiful than the impulse to recognize someone\nsimply for the sake of their humanity. It's a reminder that we are all\nconnected in some way, even if it's just by the reality of life and death.\n\nAs Starik wrote in his preface to The Lonely Funeral: \"We do not know to whom\nwe say goodbye, so we feel no pain. But everyone\u2014and this is the point\u2014every\nperson deserves respect.\"\n\nLeave it to the poets to remind us of the inherent worth of every human being\nand to honor it with such a simple, selfless service.\n\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n  * A 'death box' may sound morbid, but it's actually a priceless gift for your loved ones \u203a\n  * 102 days after his wife's death, Patton Oswalt describes grief as only he can. \u203a\n  * A husband took these photos of his wife and captured love and loss beautifully. \u203a\n\ncommunity\n\nFamily\n\n## Married couple swears by the '3-Hour Night' as a relationship game changer\n\n###\n\n\"If you\u2019re stuck in a rut with your evenings \u2014 try this!\"\n\nHeather Wake\n\nUpworthy Staff\n\n04.07.24\n\n@racheleehiggins/TikTok\n\nWant out of a relationship rut? The Three hour night might be the perfect\nsolution.\n\nAlmost every long term relationship suffers from a rut eventually. That goes\nespecially for married partners who become parents and have the added\nresponsibility of raising kids. Maintaining a connection is hard enough in\nthis busy, fast paced world. Top it off with making sure kids are awake,\ndressed, entertained, well fed, oh yeah, and alive...and you best believe all\nyou have energy for at the end of the day is sitting on the couch barely\nmaking it through one episode on Netflix.\n\nAnd yet, we know how important it is to maintain a connection with our\nspouses. Many of us just don\u2019t know how to make that happen while juggling a\nmillion other things.\n\nAccording to one mom, a \u201cthree-hour night\u201d could be just the thing to tick off\nmultiple boxes on the to-do list while rekindling romance at the same time.\nTalk about the ultimate marriage hack.\n\nKeep ReadingShow less\n\nmarriage\n\n## It's time to rethink the term 'geriatric pregnancy' as more women wait to\nhave children\n\n###\n\nWomen are having children well past 40 but are considered \"geriatric\" after\n35.\n\nJacalyn Wetzel\n\n04.08.24\n\nBBC News|YouTube\n\nRethinking the term 'geriatric pregnancy' as more women wait for kids\n\nIn more recent decades, women have started to delay having children or decide\nto not have them at all. Society has been taught that women must have children\nwhen they're in their 20s because that's when fertility is highest.\nUnfortunately it's true that fertility declines as women age, but pregnancy is\nstill possible up until menopause.\n\nEven if someone previously didn't want children, with technology they have the\noption to change their minds much later in life. Many women have taken to the\nidea of having more life and career experience before brining about children.\nBut the language around pregnancy in women over 35 is still pretty offensive.\n\nThis now more common phenomenon of waiting until later in life to have\nchildren is medically called a geriatric pregnancy, though some doctors sugar\ncoat it by calling it \"advanced maternal age.\" Neither of these terms feels\nindicative of a warm feeling you're expected to experience while growing a\nchild. BBC's The Global Story podcast blows through some pretty unfortunate\nmisconceptions and truths about pregnancy after 35 in an interview with the\nHead of Reproductive Science and Sociology Group, UCL.\n\nKeep ReadingShow less\n\nwomen delaying children\n\nJoy\n\n## Family posts a very chill note to neighbors explaining why their dog is on\nthe roof\n\n###\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your concern but please do not knock on our door..\"\n\nUpworthy Staff\n\n04.06.24\n\nvia Reddit\n\nMeet Huckleberry the dog.\n\nIf you were taking a stroll through a quiet neighborhood and happened to catch\na glance of this majestic sight, you might bat an eye. You might do a double\ntake. If you were (somewhat understandably) concerned about this surprising\nroof-dog's welfare, you might even approach the homeowners to tell them, \"Uh,\nI'm not sure if you know...but there's a...dog...on your ROOF.\"\n\nWell, the family inside is aware that there's often a dog on their roof. It's\ntheir pet Golden, Huckleberry, and he just sorta likes it up there.\n\nKeep ReadingShow less\n\ndogs\n\nGet stories worth sharing delivered to your inbox\n\nBy signing up you agree to Upworthy's privacy policy.\n\nEducation\n\n## Watching kids do lightning fast mental math is both mesmerizing and mind-\nblowing\n\n###\n\nTheir finger twitching looks random, but WOW is it impressive.\n\nAnnie Reneau\n\n04.08.24\n\nDigamarthi Sri Ramakanth/Wikimedia Commons\n\n2003 UCMAS National Abacus & Mental Arithmetic Competition\n\nIn the age of calculators and smartphones, it's become less necessary to do\nmath in your head than it used to be, but that doesn't mean mental math is\nuseless. Knowing how to calculate in your head can be handy, and if you're\nlucky enough to learn mental abacus skills from a young age, it can be wicked\nfast as well.\n\nVideo of students demonstrating how quickly they can calculate numbers in\ntheir head are blowing people's minds, as the method is completely foreign for\nmany of us. The use of a physical abacus isn't generally taught in the United\nStates, other than perhaps a basic introduction to how it works. But precious\nfew of us ever get to see how the ancient counter gets used for mental math.\n\nKeep ReadingShow less\n\neducation\n\nPop Culture\n\n## Kristen Wiig plays a cult leader pilates coach in an epic 'SNL' return\n\n###\n\nKristen Wiig made an epic return to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d this week\n\nHeather Wake\n\n04.08.24\n\nSaturday Night Live/Youtube\n\nA creepy slowed down version of Megan Thee Stallion's \"Body\" was a fabulous\ntouch.\n\nKristen Wiig made an epic return to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d this week, and along\nwith bringing back her iconic \u201cAunt Linda\u201d character, she might have created a\nwhole new fan favorite.\n\nIn a horror trailer reminiscent of an A24 film, Chloe Fineman and Molly\nKearney work up the courage to take their first pilates class.

Whenever we consider performing a task that may be boring,\nunpleasant, or stressful, the brain automatically sends a signal that says why\nnot do it \u201clater\u201d or \u201ctomorrow\u201d?\n\nHumans are natural-born procrastinators because our old brain wants to protect\nus from potential danger or discomfort. So, when faced with an uncomfortable\nsituation, our brain springs into action and suggests we do it later.\n\nWhile some people are able to override this reaction, many cannot and\nresearchers believe that around 20% are chronic procrastinators.\n\nAs we all know, this knee-jerk reaction can cause all sorts of troubles. It\ncan make it a lot harder to be a good employee, take care of domestic\nresponsibilities, or ensure our school work is done on time. According to\nPsychological Science, chronic procrastinators have higher levels of anxiety\nand often have inadequate retirement savings.\n\nKeep ReadingShow less\n\npsychology\n\nGet stories worth sharing delivered to your inbox\n\nBy signing up you agree to Upworthy's privacy policy.\n\nTrending Stories\n\nclimate change\n\nScience\n\n## What will Earth look like if all its land ice melts?
