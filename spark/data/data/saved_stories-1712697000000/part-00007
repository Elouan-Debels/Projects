However, substantial computational\n> complexity poses limitations for their application in long-context tasks,\n> such as high-resolution image generation. This paper introduces a series of\n> architectures adapted from the RWKV model used in the NLP, with requisite\n> modifications tailored for diffusion model applied to image generation\n> tasks, referred to as Diffusion-RWKV. Similar to the diffusion with\n> Transformers, our model is designed to efficiently handle patchnified inputs\n> in a sequence with extra conditions, while also scaling up effectively,\n> accommodating both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its\n> distinctive advantage manifests in its reduced spatial aggregation\n> complexity, rendering it exceptionally adept at processing high-resolution\n> images, thereby eliminating the necessity for windowing or group cached\n> operations. Experimental results on both condition and unconditional image\n> generation tasks demonstrate that Diffison-RWKV achieves performance on par\n> with or surpasses existing CNN or Transformer-based diffusion models in FID\n> and IS metrics while significantly reducing total computation FLOP usage.\n\nSubjects:| Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.04478 [cs.CV]  \n(or arXiv:2404.04478v1 [cs.CV] for this version)  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Zhengcong Fei [view email] [v1] Sat, 6 Apr 2024 02:54:35 UTC (18,551 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Diffusion-RWKV: Scaling RWKV-Like Architectures\nfor Diffusion Models, by Zhengcong Fei and 4 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * HTML (experimental)\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
