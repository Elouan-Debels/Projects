Now anyone on the social\nmedia platform can use them.\n\nPasskeys are both easier to use and more secure than passwords because they\nlet users sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices:\nWith Face ID, Touch ID, or a device passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to\nonline attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS\none-time codes.\n\nApple integrated passkeys into iOS in 2022 with the launch of iOS 16, and it\nis also available in iPadOS 16.1 and later as well as macOS Ventura and later.\n\nTo set up passkeys in X on iPhone, follow these steps:\n\n  1. Log in to the X app.\n  2. Click Your account in the navigation bar.\n  3. Select Settings and privacy, then click Security and account access, then Security.\n  4. Under Additional password protection, click Passkey.\n  5. Enter your password when prompted.\n  6. Select Add a passkey and follow the prompts.\n\n> Update: Passkeys is now available as a login option for everyone globally on\n> iOS! Try it out.https://t.co/v1LyN0l8wF \u2014 Safety (@Safety) April 8, 2024\n\nX is just one of several companies to implement support for passkeys in recent\nmonths, with other supporting apps and websites including Google, PayPal, Best\nBuy, eBay, Dashlane, and Microsoft.\n\nTags: Passkeys, Twitter\n\n[ 24 comments ]\n\n## Top Rated Comments\n\nmystery hill\n\n2 hours ago at 02:27 am\n\nWhen will MacRumors roll out passkey support?\n\nScore: 9 Votes (Like | Disagree)\n\nhagar\n\n2 hours ago at 02:43 am\n\n> We need to set a date to drop the \u201cformerly Twitter\u201d out of the lexicon.\n\nWhy?
