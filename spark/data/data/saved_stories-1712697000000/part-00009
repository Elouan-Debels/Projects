JEAN-CHRISTOPHE BOTT/\u00a9 KEYSTONE / JEAN-\nCHRISTOPHE BOTT\n\nIn a much-anticipated ruling, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg\nwill decide on Tuesday whether Swiss authorities are responsible for not\nimplementing efficient climate change policies and violating the right to life\nof a group of elderly women in Switzerland. The verdict could set a precedent\nand have worldwide repercussions.\n\nThis content was published on April 8, 2024 - 16:37\n\n4 minutes\n\nA journalist from Ticino resident in Bern, I write on scientific and social\nissues with reports, articles, interviews and analysis.

It comes eight years after\nthey called on the Swiss federal government to adopt more ambitious emissions\nreduction targets, and a series of defeats in the Swiss courts.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)\nwill deliver its verdict on the lawsuit launched by the Swiss association and\nfour plaintiffs. This is the first time in its history that the ECHR has to\nrule on the impacts of climate change on citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\nMore\n\n## More\n\n### Newsletters\n\nSign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your\ninbox.\n\nRead more: Newsletters\n\nAt the same hearing, the court will also rule on two other climate-related\ncases. One of them accuses Switzerland along with 31 other nations of not\ndoing enough to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C compared with preindustrial\nlevels, as inked in the binding Paris Agreements signed in 2015.\n\n\u201cSince I know the date [of the ruling], I\u2019m having a little more trouble\nsleeping,\u201d Rosmarie Wydler-W\u00e4lti, co-chair of the association, said in recent\ndays. \u201cIf we win, we all win.\u201d\n\n## Climate policy and the European Convention on Human Rights\n\nThe elderly women are accusing Swiss authorities of pursuing a climate policy\nwith insufficient goals and measures. They say this violates the right to life\nof women of old age. The association argues that if all countries followed\nSwiss policy, then global warming could reach 3\u00b0C by 2100.\n\nHowever, the request to adopt more ambitious targets in reducing emissions was\nrejected first by the Federal Administrative Court in Switzerland and then by\nthe Federal Supreme Court, the country\u2019s highest ruling body.\n\nIn 2020, the association, supported by Greenpeace Switzerland, decided to turn\nto the ECHR, which decided to accept the case. To back their cause, the\nelderly women denounced that Switzerland was violating several rights\nenshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, including the right to\nlife (Article 2) and the right to respect for private and family life (Article\n8).\n\nMore\n\n## More\n\n### Is the climate crisis a threat to human rights?\n\nThis content was published on Dec 4, 2020 The prosecution of the Swiss\ngovernment at the European Court of Human Rights by a climate association\ncould set a European...\n\nRead more: Is the climate crisis a threat to human rights?\n\nIn support of its argument, the association presented scientific evidence\nshowing that elderly people are more vulnerable to the effects of the climate\ncrisis and heat waves in particular. According to some studiesExternal link,\nwomen are more affected than men.\n\n## An important signal to all Council of Europe countries\n\nIf the ECHR were to find a violation of Articles 2 and 8 of the convention,\nSwitzerland\u2019s obligation to protect the elderly women would be established.\nStrasbourg could call on the Swiss government to formulate more concrete\nclimate goals or draft legislation to that effect.\n\nFurthermore, a positive decision would have repercussions for numerous other\ncountries as well. The ECHR verdict would set a precedent, and national courts\nin all Council of Europe member states would be called upon to apply that\njurisprudence when ruling on similar cases.\n\n\u201cThe ECHR verdict will send an important signal worldwide,\u201d says Rapha\u00ebl\nMahaim, a lawyer accompanying the case and a Green Party member of the Swiss\nparliament.\n\n## Climate change\u2019s risk to human rights\n\nEven if the court does not find a violation of the rights to life and health,\nthe \u201cSenior Women for Climate Protection\u2019s\u201d lawsuit could still be important\nin other respects, says Corina Heri, a researcher at the University of Zurich\nLaw Institute.\n\nFor example, the lawsuit also alleges violations of procedural human rights,\nclaiming that the Swiss legal system has not guaranteed the plaintiffs\nsufficient access to justice (Article 6 of the Convention) or the possibility\nof an effective appeal (Article 13).\n\n\u201cEngaging with these arguments could strengthen the role of domestic courts in\nfuture climate litigation cases both in and outside Switzerland,\u201d according to\nHeri.\n\nRegardless of their outcome, the jurist says, the Swiss association\u2019s case and\nthe related cases draw attention to the very real risk to human rights posed\nby climate change.\n\nEdited by Virginie Mangin\n\nMore\n\n## More\n\n### Climate litigation comes to Switzerland\n\nThis content was published on Dec 21, 2022 For the first time, a climate\nlitigation case has opened in Switzerland.
