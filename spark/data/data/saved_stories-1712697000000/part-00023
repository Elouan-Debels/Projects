Manage SAST,\nsecrets, and supply chain security in a single platform that eliminates\ndeveloper friction.\n\nStart scanning for freeBook a demo\n\nLeading engineering teams choose semgrep\n\n## Developers trust findings from Semgrep\n\n### Say bye to false positives\n\n  * Get findings you actually trust with high-confidence Pro rules, written to be accurate and actionable for developers.\n\n  * Reduce false positives in high/critical dependency vulnerabilities by up to 98% with reachability analysis.\n\n  * Build the lowest noise solution possible for your codebase with easily customizable rules.\n\n### Eliminate developer friction\n\n  * Present findings to developers in their workflows (PR comments, Jira, IDE) - but only if they are accurate.\n\n  * Give developers the context they need to action on findings without hours of research and context-switching.\n\n  * Speed up triage and make remediation effortless for developers with Semgrep Assistant, powered by GPT-4\n\n### Fix issues before build time\n\n  * Don\u2019t slow down a developer\u2019s commit flow - Semgrep scans run in minutes, even with cross-file analysis enabled.\n\n  * Find and fix common issues like the OWASP Top Ten before compiling to speed delivery and reduce tech debt.\n\n  * Easily enforce secure practices and policies specific to your organization with custom rules.\n\nEasy to customize, easy to use\n\n### Give engineers everything they need to build the optimal AppSec program\nfor your codebase\n\nExtensible\n\nSemgrep runs anywhere you need it, from CLI to CI/CD. Findings can be surfaced\nin developer workflows, our cloud platform, or ingested into your existing\ntools via API.\n\nCustomizable\n\nSemgrep is built with the capabilities needed to enforce any type of AppSec\nprogram, and designed to let teams tailor these capabilities to their needs as\nthey grow.\n\nTransparent\n\nSemgrep rules are visible to users and their syntax is similar to source code.\nAnyone can understand why findings are surfaced and how they can be optimized.\n\nLudicrously Fast\n\nSemgrep's median CI scan time is 10 seconds. Building an optimal AppSec\nprogram is an iterative process, and Semgrep doesn't just help you get there,\nit helps you get there fast.\n\nWorks with 30+ frameworks and technologies\n\n### Great out-of-the-box, even better when customized\n\nWrite or extend rules to find bugs and enforce practices specific to your\ncodebase. Rules look like source code so any developer can build on Semgrep.\n\nTry it in your browser\n\nprint(...)\n\n$X == $X\n\nboto3.client(...)\n\nhello('world')\n\nfoo(1)\n\n\u201c\n\nFigmates get actionable security feedback in their PRs, while rule analytics\ngive security feedback on their effectiveness.

This flexibility is a huge\nwin, and the library of managed rules means we only have to write our own when\nwe have custom problems.\n\nMake shift left work\n\nProducts\n\nSemgrep Code\n\nSemgrep Supply Chain\n\nSemgrep Cloud Platform\n\nSemgrep Pro Engine\n\nCommunity\n\nBlog\n\nResources\n\nDocs\n\nROI Calculator\n\nPricing\n\nGetting Started With Semgrep\n\nRegistry\n\nPlayground\n\nBook a demo\n\nHelp Center\n\nCompany\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nContact us\n\n###### Stay up to date\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n\u00a9 2024 Semgrep, Inc.
