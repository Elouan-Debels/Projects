However, many\nof them were also having a tough time setting up the environment to run the\nscripts: Python, libusb, Windows drivers, and all that complicated stuff: the\nuser experience was completely off.\n\nThis led me to the idea of creating a multiplatform web UI that could simplify\neverything. I developed a prototype and shared the link on a Facebook group\nfor repair technicians, where it was warmly (..really warmly!) received.\n\nFew days later, I noticed that the beta link spread on Reddit, where non-\ntechnical users (gamers) were able to solve minor analog stick drifting issues\nin a matter of seconds thanks to this tool!\n\nOverall, I\u2019m thrilled that this website is helping so many people in repairing\ntheir controllers and, at the same time, reducing e-waste from worn-out\ncontrollers!\n\n## Current challenges\n\nCurrently, the primary focus is ensuring a highly reliable platform for all\nusers, without risking any damage on their controllers.\n\nAt the moment I tried to handle this by performing many checks before and\nafter each calibration step. If any of these checks fails, the whole process\nis halted to prevent any potential harm.\n\nAdditionally, the platform has a detection mechanism to identify non-original\nDualShock4. In such case, all functionalities are disabled. This is because\nthese clones only support a fraction of the commands available in the original\ncontrollers: they are essentially designed to mimic the original DS4 only to\ntrick the PS4 into believing the controller is authentic.\n\nThe calibration wouldn\u2019t work anyway, because those commands (as you may\nguess) have not been replicated. Probably they would do some random action,\nwith the risk of bricking it.\n\nIf any developer of the clones reads this and wants to help me figuring out\nwhich commands should be sent to calibrate them, I would be happy to upgrade\nthe web-ui .\n\n## Future steps\n\nCurrently, there are four major tasks on my to-do list, each of which will\nrequire a substantial amount of time to accomplish:\n\n  * Add other undocumented commands to the web-ui, so that this website may become a full-fledged repair tool for both DS4 and DS5 controllers.\n  * Obtain a DS Edge and reverse-engineer it, to add calibration support also for it.\n  * Reverse engineer the XBox Controller provided by GsmHack4You. This will take lot of time.\n  * Reverse engineer the PlayStation3 controller to figure out how to calibrate it.\n\nWhile all these tasks are currently in the ideation phase, I\u2019m open to any\nother suggestions or ideas that may contribute to the enhancement of the tool!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn closing, I want to express my gratitude to all the readers and people who\ncontributed and are supporting it.\n\nI remain open to ideas, suggestions, and feedback from all of you. If you\nencounter any issues or have ideas for improvement, please don\u2019t hesitate to\ncontact me!\n\nThanks\n\n~~~\n\nIf you want to get in touch, drop me an email at ds4@the.al or ping me on IRC\n(the_al@freenode|libera|hackint) or Discord (the_al).\n\n", "frontpage": true}
