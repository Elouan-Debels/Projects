The\nfirst aircraft, the VVA-14M1, was to be a proof-of-concept aircraft, designed\nto test both the overall aerodynamics and additional technology which might be\nused. At first the VVA-14M1 was fitted with rigid pontoons on the ends of the\ncentral wing section, and later with these replaced by inflatable pontoons.\n\nThe VVA-14M2 was to be more advanced, with two engines providing thrust into\nthe cavity under the wing to give lift, and later a series of lift engines\nwere to be installed which would provide VTOL capability. Additionally, the\nVVA-14M2 was intended to be equipped with fly-by-wire flight controls.\n\nThe VVA-14M3 was the final aircraft. This would be a combat-ready, VTOL\nvehicle, fully equipped with weapons and with the Burevestnik computerised ASW\n(anti-submarine warfare) system, Bor-1 MAD (magnetic anomaly detector) and\nother operational equipment.\n\nUnfortunately the three-stage development never materialised. Instead, after\nextensive research, including the development of the small prototype Be-1 wing\nin ground effect aircraft, the first VVA-14 prototype was completed in 1972.\nIts first flight was from a conventional runway on 4 September 1972.\n\nIn 1974 the aircraft was retro-fitted with inflatable pontoons, but these\nproved to be rather troublesome. The first amphibious test flights started in\nJune of 1975.\n\nDue to the problems with the inflatable pontoons, they were soon ditched in\nfavor of the original rigid ones. At the same time the fuselage was lengthened\nand additional engines added. Unfortunately the bureau which was supposed to\ndeliver the engines to enable VTOL flight never made good on their promise.\nThis meant VTOL testing of the Bartini Beriev VVA-14 was never undertaken.\n\nIn 1974, after Bartini died, the Bartini Beriev VVA-14 was gradually wound\ndown. In total the aircraft made 107 flights, and spent a combined 103 hours\nin the air.\n\nIn 1987, the only remaining Bartini Beriev VVA-14, serial number 19172, was\nsent to the Russian Federation Central Air Force Museum in Monino. The\naircraft is still at the museum, where it sits in a rather sorry-looking semi-\ndismantled state. Sad considering what a remarkable aircraft it could have\nbeen.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n  * https://hague6185.wordpress.com/2014/04/06/russias-flying-submairne/\n  * https://hague6185.wordpress.com/2014/04/05/russian-cold-war-ingenuity/\n  * https://hague6185.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/the-final-objective-connect-sercet-submarine-base-to-object-221/\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Twitter\n  * Facebook\n  * Email\n  * Print\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Reddit\n  * Tumblr\n  * Pocket\n  * More\n\n  * Pinterest\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### Related\n\n#### Russia\u2019s \u2013 \u201cCaspian Sea Monster\u201d\n\nThe Caspian Sea Monster This aircraft, it is an aircraft takes off from the\nsea and carries 6 missile launch tubes.
