In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for\n> enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring,\n> grounding, and reasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically\n> exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of\n> interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate \"any\n> resolution\" on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual\n> features. Specifically, each screen is divided into 2 sub-images based on\n> the original aspect ratio (i.e., horizontal division for portrait screens\n> and vertical division for landscape screens). Both sub-images are encoded\n> separately before being sent to LLMs. We meticulously gather training\n> samples from an extensive range of elementary UI tasks, such as icon\n> recognition, find text, and widget listing. These samples are formatted for\n> instruction-following with region annotations to facilitate precise\n> referring and grounding. To augment the model's reasoning ability, we\n> further compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed\n> description, perception/interaction conversations, and function inference.\n> After training on the curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding\n> comprehension of UI screens and the capability to execute open-ended\n> instructions. For model evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark\n> encompassing all the aforementioned tasks. Ferret-UI excels not only beyond\n> most open-source UI MLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary\n> UI tasks.\n\nSubjects:| Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Computation and\nLanguage (cs.CL); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)  \n---|---  \nCite as:| arXiv:2404.05719 [cs.CV]  \n(or arXiv:2404.05719v1 [cs.CV] for this version)  \nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.05719arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite  \n  \n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Keen You [view email] [v1] Mon, 8 Apr 2024 17:55:44 UTC (23,745 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Ferret-UI: Grounded Mobile UI Understanding\nwith Multimodal LLMs, by Keen You and 7 other authors\n\n  * View PDF\n  * TeX Source\n  * Other Formats\n\nview license\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.CV\n\n< prev | next >\n\nnew | recent | 2404\n\nChange to browse by:\n\ncs cs.CL cs.HC\n\n### References & Citations\n\n  * NASA ADS\n  * Google Scholar\n  * Semantic Scholar\n\na export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nTXYZ.AI (What is TXYZ.AI?)\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\n  * Author\n  * Venue\n  * Institution\n  * Topic\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new\narXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and\naccepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.\narXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to\nthem.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
