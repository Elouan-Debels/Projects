View interactive zoomable image on Motic's\nserver.\n\nIn 2022, I was contacted and asked if I could produce a picture of an aspen\nleaf enlarged to 40 feet tall. The image was to be a photographed with a light\nmicroscope at 200X so that the individual cells and organelles with the leaf\ncould be seen when standing close to the enlarged image. Many images would\nneed to be taken of the leaf and then stitched together to form a giant\npanorama. This seemed like it should be straight forward, but it wasn\u2019t.\n\nAspen leaves were collected in September around Calgary with the help of my\nfather and wife.\n\nI have made many large panoramas before some of them 10 feet tall and 30 feet\nwide with no problem using Photoshop. But these photos were all landscape\npanoramic images or pictures of the night sky and aurora. I have also taken\nthousands of photomicrographs and with several kinds of light microscopes and\nall of my microscopes had attached high resolution Nikon or Canon digital\nsingle lens reflex cameras (DSLRs).\n\nHere I describe methods I used to make a large panorama of a leaf and some of\nthe challenges I had to overcome in doing so. I also show one system by Motic\nthat automatically stitches images from prepared specimens on microscope\nslides. The use of digital images taken with a microscope is referred to as\nvirtual microscopy. An automatic scanning system is more costly, but it saves\na tremendous amount of time when compared to stitching images manually. I also\nfound one free software program that could handle large numbers of images and\nalso produce panoramic images from a video taken of the specimen (Microsoft\nICE \u2013 image composite editor). Eventually, I was able to produce a large image\n40 feet tall at 300 dpi (dots per inch) using a combination of Adobe Photoshop\nCS2023 and Topaz Gigapixel.\n\nTo make large panoramas with a light microscope a mechanical stage with XY\ntranslation is necessary to move the microscope slide. Smaller pans of 20-30\nimages can be made by moving the slide by hand, but it is easier with a\nmechanical stage. It is important that adjacent images overlap on all four\nsides by 25-30%. I used a software program to capture images from my cameras\ncalled Digicam control which is free. The program offers a viewing grid to\nensure that each photo I took had sufficient overlap. It took me several hours\nto capture images of a single leaf. I first began by doing some preliminary\ntests on only part of the leaf.\n\nImage Capture\n\nI captured RAW image files primarily using a Nikon D500 at IS0 200 using a\nZeiss Axioscope microscope with bright field and DIC (Differential\nInterference Contrast optics). I kept the microscope light constant and the\nmicroscope was set up for K\u00f6hler illumination (R. Berdan 2022). I tried\nseveral different software programs to stitch the images. My computer was a\nWindows 10 PC, with 64 GB RAM and a 4 TB solid state drive, AMD Ryzen 2700X\n3.7 GHz, 8 core processor.\n\nMicroscopes I use in my home laboratory with DSLR cameras connected to a\ncomputer\n\nScreen capture of Digicam control software showing an aspen leaf at 200X. This\nsoftware is used to capture images from my Nikon D500 camera attached to my\nmicroscope while viewing the image live on a computer screen. Using live view\nI avoid vibration from the camera mirror \u201cslap\u201d while making exposures. For\ncritical focus the software allows me to zoom in on the screen.\n\nAbove is a screen capture of Digicam control with the image of an Aspen leaf\nat 200X. A grid can be turned on and off to ensure adequate overlap of\nadjacent images. The lighter regions of the images above shows how adjacent\nregions need overlap by about 25-30% on all sides to guarantee a good blending\nof the images. The white overlay is just a graphic representation of the\namount of overlap needed between adjacent images you can also see the light\ngray grid.\n\nI tried several panoramic stitching programs: Photoshop, Microsoft ICE (Image\nComposite Editor), Autopano giga, and PTGui. Motic also scanned some Aspen and\nElodea leaves for me using their automated turn-key stitching microscope and\nsoftware that permits taking a focus stack of each image and then stitching\nthem (see below).\n\nAspen Leaves\n\nAfter collecting leaves I flattened them for several days between glass\nmicroscope slides using a paper clip.\n\nI began collecting aspen leaves in September when they began to change colour.\nAspen leaves vary in size from about 1\\2 inch to several inches. I selected\nthe smallest leaves I could find. I first stitched a leaf taken at 50X, then\n100X and finally 200X. The leaves were not as flat as I hoped. At high\nmagnifications the small depth of field made blending the images more\ndifficult. I tried flattening the leaves between two microscope slides with\nlarge paper clips. On top of this problem, aspen leaves turned out to be\nseveral cell layers thick making it difficult to see the individual cells and\norganelles clearly.\n\nIn order to make the aspen leaves transparent I soaked them in various\nsolutions, and also boiled them in water.\n\nI tried clearing the leaves using several solvents e.g. distilled water\n(control), Hydrogen peroxide 30%, Glacial acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide\n1:1 (Franklin\u2019s solution), glacial acetic acid, household bleach (5% sodium\nhypochlorite), 70% isopropyl alcohol, lactic acid, and methyl salicylate.\nThese chemicals were chosen on the basis of previous studies describing\nclearing methods for plant leaves (J.M Heer, 1993, E Garcia\u2013Gutierrez et al.\n2020).\n\nSome methods I used on the leaves required fixing them first \u2013 I tried both\nBouin\u2019s fixative and 2.5% glutaraldehyde. I left the leaves for several days\nin the clearing solutions. Franklin\u2019s solution worked the best and resulted in\nwhite leaves with a mesh network but most of the cellular components were\nextracted (E. Garcia-Gutierrez etal., 2020).\n\nAspen leaves mounted on microscope slides. I selected the smallest leaves I\ncould find, about 1\\2 an inch in size. The aspen leaves turned out to be too\nthick (about 6 cells deep) and their lack of leaf transparency made the\nobservation of intracellular details difficult.\n\nClearing the aspen leaves was not helpful for making panoramic photos as no\ncellular detail was visible. Therefore I then began to explore the use of\nsmaller thinner leaves from a water plant Elodea.\n\nManual panoramic images of Elodea\n\nAbove image shows the tip of a live Elodea canadensis leaf taken with\ndifferential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (panorama). This plant\nleaf is only two cell layers thick and intracellular organelles and\nchloroplasts are visible - 200X.\n\nI recalled studying Elodea leaves in a first year university biology lab.\nElodea is a common fresh water plant found in ponds in North America. The\nlarge size of the cells makes this plant ideal for studying cytoplasmic\nstreaming of chloroplasts which can be seen moving around the edges of the\ncells \u2013 see movie below. Unfortunately in October I was not able to collect\nany Elodea plants in ponds around Calgary.\n\nTwo species of Elodea I ordered from Carolina Biological - Elodea canadensis\nand Elodea densa\n\nI visited an aquarium store in Calgary called Pet Emporium. Unfortunately they\ntold me that Elodea was no longer allowed to be sold in Canada because it is\nconsidered an invasive plant (see Wikipedia). I contacted Boreal labs in\nOntario which provides science supplies for educational use in schools and\nthey also told me they were not allowed to sell Elodea. I then contacted\nCarolina Biological in the US via Merlin.ca located in Toronto and ordered\nElodea. I ordered two species of Elodea, and had to pay $100 extra for\ninspection at the US border. I received Elodea plants about a week later and\nthey are still living in my aquarium (in January 2023). I cut off small leaves\nwhere they are attached to the stem and began photographing them. I placed the\nlive leaves in water under a coverslip. I sometimes sealed the coverslip with\nclear nail polish so that water would not evaporate while taking the pictures.\nLight and heat from the microscope light stimulated more movement of\nchloroplasts around the cells. The smaller size of the Elodea canadensis\nleaves made it the better choice.\n\nCytoplasmic streaming in Elodea 200X DIC Microscopy\n\nWatch movie on YouTube: https://youtu.be/p9-Ob9M6LX4\n\nElodea canadensis leaf panorama, the leaf was photographed by moving the leaf\nwith a mechanical stage, and photographing them by DIC microscopy and\nstitching the individual images.\n\nElodea canadensis leaf panorama, the leaf was photographed manually by bright-\nfield microscopy. Using Photoshop and Topaz Gigapixel I was able to make\nseveral panoramic images 40 feet tall at 300 dpi.\n\nPhotographing Panoramic Images\n\nWhen photographing panoramas of landscapes I use a special tripod which allows\nme to rotate my camera 360 degrees at specific intervals and I orient my\ncamera in the vertical position. This keeps the camera and lens level, and it\nensures I get about 30% overlap between frames. The camera is focused to\ninfinity and I use a small F-stop (e.g. F11 or F16) to maximize the depth of\nfield. I set the camera to M or manual shooting mode so the exposure does not\nchange as the camera is rotated 360 degrees. The initial exposure should be\nbased on the scene in the direction away from the sun. I do not use a\npolarizing filter on a sunny day, because it makes the sky difficult to blend\nevenly. I also make spherical panoramas with PTGui software - if interested\nyou can view some of my spherical pans.\n\nIn microscopy, to photograph a panorama you set the camera to manual mode,\nlock the exposure, and white balance so all exposures are the same. You\nusually choose one focus point and keep it. It is possible to focus stack the\nadjacent images manually if you are only working on a few images .e.g. a\ndozen, but if you are going to try to stitch 500 or more images, focus\nstacking isn\u2019t practical unless you use an automated stacking solution.\n\nSome panoramic software requires more computer memory than others, e.g.\nPhotoshop only allows stitching images of a certain size depending on the file\ntype you use e.g. .jpg vs .tif vs RAW etc. If you are not trying to make\nreally large panoramic images, you shouldn\u2019t have problems, but when I tried\nto stitch more than 500 raw files Photoshop would lock up. Older versions of\nPhotoshop could handle files up to 2 GB and newer versions up to 4 GB.\nPhotoshop\u2019s PSD files are limited in size to 30,000 x 30,000 pixels (2GB). The\n.psb file format by adobe will support up to about 300,000 x 300,000 pixels. I\nhave been able to save files up to about 50 GB with the .PSB format.\n\nThere are dozens of software programs that can stitch images together\nincluding several free programs. See software reviews on panoramic software if\nyou are considering a stitching program (e.g. P. Skidmore 2022 , D. Coleman,\n2022, Wikipedia). I have used Photoshop for over 25 years so this was my first\nchoice. Unfortunately Photoshop has some limitations when it comes to making\nvery large panoramic images. In the end I used Microsoft ICE and also a\ncombination of Photoshop and Gigapixel to achieve 40 foot tall images. One\nprogram I tested, Autopano giga was easy to use, and it stitched images\nquickly without having to make any input changes. Unfortunately I learned that\nthis excellent program was discontinued in 2015 after it was purchased by\nGoPro. I used a free trial version still available for download. Another\nprogram called Microsoft ICE (ICE \u2013 Image Composite Editor) can stitch very\nlarge images and was free. I was pleasantly surprised how well this program\nworked stitching a large number of images. PTGui is a popular and relatively\ninexpensive program I tried, but with the default settings it failed to stitch\nthe leaves properly. I have since found an instructional PDF that describes\nhow to configure PTGui to stitch photomicrographs and the best settings to use\nfor making panoramas of wood sections taken with a microscope (G. on Arx,\n2017).\n\nMost stitching software can process a few dozen images without any problems \u2013\nit\u2019s when you exceed a certain size that issues arise. Sometimes images fail\nto stitch because of insufficient overlap of the images, or there wasn\u2019t\nsufficient information in the images to blend them e.g. clear skies or sold\ncoloured backgrounds.\n\nPhotoshop offers the ability to save very large files in a large file format\nwith the extension .PSB which has a maximum size of 300,000 pixels in one\ndimension (File Format). PSB files can be converted to other file formats\n.TIF, .JPG, though some of these file formats have maximum dimensions e.g. JPG\nJPEG/JFIF supports a maximum image size of 65,535\u00d765,535 pixels, hence up to 4\ngigapixels for an aspect ratio of 1:1 (Wikipedia). The largest files I could\nsave on my computer were about 50GB. To make larger files I combined the use\nof Topaz Gigapixel with Photoshop. This versatile software program seems to\nwork well with both low and high resolution images. This software, however is\nnot good for enlarging images containing text (e.g. maps).\n\nWhen I first started stitching images with Photoshop I tried parts of leaves\nto see if the software was working. I occasionally missed some sections, but\nafter a bit of practice and using a grid I began to get better results. I\nattempted whole leaves with 500 to 1000 images but Photoshop would lock up\nwhen stitching more than 500 images. I had set Photoshop to use 75 \u2013 80% of my\ncomputer's memory (64 GB) and it still locked up. I also configured my\ncomputer to use virtual space on another hard drive containing several\nterabytes of free space but this did not seem to help.\n\nAbove is a stitch of an aspen leaf using Microsoft ICE \u2013 it did a nice job,\nand the software is easy to use, and can be downloaded for free. MS ICE can\nalso make panoramas from a video of the specimen \u2013 move the slide while taking\na video. Be sure to move the slide slowly and then import the video or drag it\ninto the main window.\n\nLow resolution image of Elodea stitched using a trial version of Autopano giga\nsoftware. The inset on the lower right corner shows a higher magnification of\nthe image and the green water marks left by the trial version.\n\nSummary for making panoramas with a microscope manually\n\nMaking panoramas with a microscope using less than 50 images is simple\nprovided you follow a few guidelines below. When using a large number of\nimages (hundreds) you need more patience and concentration and it can take\nseveral hours to take all the images required.\n\n> 1\\. The microscope field should be illuminated evenly (K\u00f6hler illumination),\n> don\u2019t change the intensity of the illumination or the white balance while\n> making exposures.\n>\n> 2\\. Set the camera to manual exposure mode, use a constant shutter speed and\n> white balance so the images blend evenly.\n>\n> 3\\. You need to ensure that the images overlap by 25 to 30% on all edges\n> (top, bottom and sides). I use a grid on my free Digicam control software to\n> ensure this. If small areas are missed they can sometimes be repaired using\n> Photoshop\u2019s content aware fill.\n>\n> 4\\. An XY mechanical stage to move the slides makes it easier to maintain\n> image overlap. A grid on your computer monitor or in your eyepiece will also\n> make it easier to ensure you have sufficient image overlap.\n>\n> 5\\. Make sure your specimen is flat. Prepared specimens mounted in Canada\n> balsam or other mounting media should work nicely. It is only practical to\n> do focus stacking on adjacent images if you are using a small number of\n> images. Alternatively use an automated stacking system like that described\n> below by Motic.\n>\n> 6\\. For large panoramas, ensure your computer has sufficient random access\n> memory (RAM) and hard drive space. An SSD (solid state drive) will speed up\n> image processing.\n\nStitching panoramas on a microscope works well for small insects, crystals and\nhistology slides. Specimens need to be stationary while you are taking\npictures.\n\nAutomated Microscope Slide Scanning by Motic\n\nThere are several companies that offer microscopes that will automatically\nscan and digitize microscope slides. These microscopes are used in\nhistopathology, teaching, virtual microscopy and biomedical research. These\nmicroscopes use a motorized XY microscope stage and some include a motorized Z\nstacking option (vertical movement). Z stacking permits the investigator to\nview different layers and focus on a specific layer in the specimen to view\n(provides depth in the image).\n\nAn automatic stitching system is useful for scanning large numbers of slides\nand it saves time. The higher cost of these systems is targeted at hospitals,\nuniversities and research labs However, Motic also offers stand-alone scanning\nsoftware that stitches large panoramas without the requirement of automated\nscanning stage and it is available for use on other microscopes but requires\nthe use of their digital cameras (Motic Analysis software). I asked Motic\nmicroscopy in Vancouver if they could scan some prepared leaf samples for me\nwith their automated microscope system.\n\nMotic Easy scan microscope for automated panoramic stitching\n\nMotic easy scan slide scanner offers automated XY scanning and Z stacking \u2013\nDownload Motic PDF. They offer several slide scanning solutions. For pricing\nand more information contact Motic Microscopy. Below I show a few images from\nMotic\u2019s scanning microscope. The interactive images can be viewed directly by\nclicking on the links below.\n\nMotic's digital images are stored in a secure database which can be linked to\nfor observation by other doctors and researchers via the internet. The images\ncan also be viewed from a desk top computer using their viewing software.\n\nAbove image from Motic Easy scan brochure (by permission) showing their set up\ncan scan slides in different modes and then merge the layers into one final,\nfully in focus image.\n\nMotic Easy stitch Pro software demonstration see - YouTube. Their scanning\nsoftware requires the use of a Motic camera and software \u2013 download Easy\nstitch software PDF. The image files are proprietary .mdsx. These files can\nonly be opened by Motic DSA software, though you can export images in JPEG\nformat with DSA software. Easy Stitch software does not have a limitation in\nsize or number of images that can be stitched. Images produced with Easy\nStitch software do not need DSA software which only applies to the scanner\nimages.\n\nBelow I show a prepared slide of an aspen leaf I prepared. Motic kindly\nscanned the aspen leaf and a few other slides for me with their automated\nslide scanning microscope.\n\nSmall aspen leaf fixed and mounted as a permanent slide in Canada balsam.\n\nBelow are screen captures of the Aspen and Elodea leaves as viewed in Motic\u2019s\nturn-key solution. Below that are links to the interactive images on Motic\u2019s\nimage database. You can view these images in your browser, change the\nmagnification, rotate the specimens and view different focus levels (Z stack)\nin the leaves. Institutions and researchers can share images like this of\nvarious pathology slides with other doctors, researchers and students.\n\nScreen captures of an Aspen leaf as viewed on the Motic online database,\nshowing them at different magnifications.

If you are interested in learning\nmore about Motic\u2019s automated slide scanning hardware and software contact\nMotic.\n\nZoomify\n\nZoomify is a program that allows photographers to insert large high resolution\nimages in a web page. The zoomify export module was installed in earlier\nversions of Photoshop and it exported files in Flash format for web pages.\nFlash was an animation program that was discontinued in 2022. It originally\nsupported large zoomable images. Since then zoomify now makes a version that\nuses javascript and it does not require a plugin. Zoomify is an excellent way\nto show large images embedded in a web page. They also offer a free version of\ntheir software with basic features like that below. Additional features,\nincluding the ability to zoom to full screen can be purchased on their web\nsite Zoomify.com.\n\n-\n\nZ\n\n+\n\nZoomify Image of Elodea leaf - zoom in and move the image with your mouse\n\nSummary\n\nI describe methods and software for making large panoramic images using a\nlight microscope, software and a digital camera. Some software allows you to\nmake large panoramas, but the process for large files requires lots of\ncomputer memory, and time to photograph the images. Image size is limited by\nthe software and hardware. Most subjects must be thin, flat, stationary and\nrequire an XY translation control to move slides on the microscope stage.\nAdjacent images need to overlap by about 25-30% with most stitching software.\nSome of the largest panoramas made can involve over 1000 images and reach 365\nmegapixels in size (NASA 2009, 2019, Zang, 2015). Zoomify permits the\ninsertion of large high resolution images in a web page for viewing, and this\nonly requires knowledge of a little bit of coding.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to thank Renzo Gavilanez, Alex Lobozar and Joe Wu at Motic\nMicroscopy in Vancouver for providng panoramic images made with their Motic\nEasy scan and the links to their interactive images in their database.
