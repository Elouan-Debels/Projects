A\nstrong consensus has built that the answer to the question is a clear no,\ncapped off by a Nobel in Economics given to one of the people whose work was\nkey to building that consensus.\n\nWhile most academics may have considered the argument put to rest, it has\nenjoyed an extended life in the political sphere. Large unknowns remain about\nboth the costs and benefits, which depend in part on the remaining\nuncertainties in climate science and in part on the assumptions baked into\neconomic models.\n\nIn Wednesday's edition of Nature, a small team of researchers analyzed how\nlocal economies have responded to the last 40 years of warming and projected\nthose effects forward to 2050. They find that we're already committed to\nwarming that will see the growth of the global economy undercut by 20 percent.\nThat places the cost of even a limited period of climate change at roughly six\ntimes the estimated price of putting the world on a path to limit the warming\nto 2\u00b0 C.\n\n## Linking economics and climate\n\nMany economic studies of climate change involve assumptions about the value of\nspending today to avoid the costs of a warmer climate in the future, as well\nas the details of those costs. But the people behind the new work, Maximilian\nKotz, Anders Levermann, and Leonie Wenz decided to take an empirical approach.\nThey obtained data about the economic performance of over 1,600 individual\nregions around the globe, going back 40 years. They then attempted to look for\nconnections between that performance and climate events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrevious research already identified a number of climate measures\u2014average\ntemperatures, daily temperature variability, total annual precipitation, the\nannual number of wet days, and extreme daily rainfall\u2014that have all been\nlinked to economic impacts. Some of these effects, like extreme rainfall, are\nlikely to have immediate effects. Others on this list, like temperature\nvariability, are likely to have a gradual impact that is only felt over time.\n\nThe researchers tested each factor for lagging effects, meaning an economic\nimpact sometime after their onset. These suggested that temperature factors\ncould have a lagging impact up to eight years after they changed, while\nprecipitation changes were typically felt within four years of climate-driven\nchanges. While this relationship might be in error for some of the economic\nchanges in some regions, the inclusion of so many regions and a long time\nperiod should help limit the impact of those spurious correlations.\n\nWith the climate/economic relationship worked out, the researchers obtained\nclimate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)\nproject. With that in hand, they could look at future climates and estimate\ntheir economic costs.\n\nObviously, there are limits to how far into the future this process will work.\nThe uncertainties of the climate models grow with time; the future economy\nstarts looking a lot less like the present, and things like temperature\nextremes start to reach levels where past economic behavior no longer applies.\n\nTo deal with that, Kotz, Levermann, and Wenz performed a random sampling to\ndetermine the uncertainty in the system they developed. They look for the\npoint where the uncertainties from the two most extreme emissions scenarios\noverlap. That occurs in 2049; after that, we can't expect the past economic\nimpacts of climate to apply.\n\nKotz, Levermann, and Wenz suggest that this is an indication of warming we're\nalready committed to, in part because the effect of past emissions hasn't been\nfelt in its entirety and partly because the global economy is a boat that\nturns slowly, so it will take time to implement significant changes in\nemissions. \"Such a focus on the near term limits the large uncertainties about\ndiverging future emission trajectories, the resulting long-term climate\nresponse and the validity of applying historically observed climate\u2013economic\nrelations over long timescales during which socio-technical conditions may\nchange considerably,\" they argue.\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive Audio\n\n#### reader comments\n\n46\n\nJohn Timmer John is Ars Technica's science editor.
