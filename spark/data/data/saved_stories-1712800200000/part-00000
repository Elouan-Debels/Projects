Saudi Arabia \u2018forced to scale back\u2019 plans for desert\nmegacity\n\nCrown prince\u2019s pet project was sold as a 105-mile-long city of the future, but\nfinances may have led to a rethink\n\nPeter Beaumont\n\nWed 10 Apr 2024 19.23 CEST\n\nShare\n\nIt was billed as a glass-walled city of the future, an ambitious centrepiece\nof the economic plan backed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to transition\nSaudi Arabia away from oil dependency.\n\nNow, however, plans for the mirror-clad desert metropolis called the Line have\nbeen scaled down and the project, which was envisaged to stretch 105 miles\n(170km) is expected to reach just a mile and a half by 2030.\n\nDreamed up as a linear city that would eventually be home to about 9 million\npeople on a footprint of just 13 sq miles, the Line is part of a wider Neom\nproject. Now at least one contractor has begun dismissing workers.\n\nA promotional image of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Neom shows the design plan for the\nparallel structures, known collectively as the Line. Photograph:\nNEOM/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe scaling down of Prince Mohammed\u2019s most grandiose project was reported by\nBloomberg, which said it had seen documents relating to the project.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s being built on our blood\u2019: the true cost of Saudi Arabia\u2019s $500bn\nmegacity\n\nRead more\n\nThe project, which had been slated to cost $1.5tn (\u00a31.2tn), was pitched as a\nreinvention of urban design. However, it has long attracted scepticism and\ncriticism, not least after the reported execution of several members of the\nHoweitat tribe who had protested over plans to construct on their ancestral\nlands.\n\nThen there were reports of Prince Mohammed\u2019s changing vision for the project,\nbudget overspends and an ever-changing roster of key staff, with some who have\nworked on the project describing it as \u201cuntethered from reality\u201d.\n\nThe city was envisaged as being car-free and connected by one of the world\u2019s\nfastest trains.
