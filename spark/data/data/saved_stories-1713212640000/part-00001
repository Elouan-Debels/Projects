Rio Grande Valley residents opposed the exchange, arguing that Boca\nChica is sacred to the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas and that the public\npark has long been a favorite recreational outpost for the majority Hispanic\ncommunity in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed last week in the district court of Travis County,\nenvironmental groups argue that the exchange is unlawful because the state\nfailed to consider alternatives to giving away public land and failed to\nensure the minimization of harm to public land. The groups also argue that the\nstate did not consider the best interests of the local community. The suit\nstates that SpaceX does not own the land the state would receive in the swap.\nThe Texas Standard reported in January that Musk was still negotiating the\npurchase of the private land.\n\n\"This is just the latest example of our state officials failing to fulfill\ntheir obligations to Texans, whenever SpaceX is involved,\" Marisa Perales, an\nattorney representing the three Rio Grande Valley organizations who filed the\nlawsuit, said in a statement. \"Protecting public park land and the public's\ninterest means saying 'no' to the demands of SpaceX, whose space flight\nactivities have caused harm to public lands and wildlife habitats.\"\n\nThe Texas Parks and Wildlife Department acquired Boca Chica State Park,\nlocated at Texas' southernmost point along the Gulf Coast, in 1994 through a\nfederal program aimed to preserve the land. The area provides habitat for some\nendangered species.\n\nSpaceX began purchasing land in the area in 2012 to build a rocket\nmanufacturing and test launch facility. The lawsuit alleges that SpaceX's\noperations have caused damage to public lands by increasing runoff of\nstormwater and creating pollution.\n\nThe Texas Parks and Wildlife Department declined to comment on the lawsuit but\nsaid the agency has, for many years, been interested in the 477 acres they\nwill acquire through the land swap.\n\n\"The 477 acres offered to TPWD near Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge\nencompass one of the most biologically diverse regions in North America,\nsheltering endangered species, winter fowl, and other migratory birds,\" said\nCory Chandler, an agency spokesperson. \"The land has been of interest to us\nand the conservation community for many years and an exchange would create a\ntenfold return while allowing TPWD to work with partners in the region to plan\nfor a new state park for public enjoyment with access for fishing, kayaking,\nwildlife viewing, hiking, biking, and family gatherings in a rapidly\ndeveloping region of Texas.\"\n\nThe Texas Tribune is a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs\nTexans - and engages with them - about public policy, politics, government,\nand statewide issues.\n\nReport a correction or typo\n\n## Related Topics\n\n  * SCIENCE\n  * TEXAS\n  * ENVIRONMENT\n  * SPACEX\n  * ELON MUSK\n  * TEXAS TRIBUNE\n  * SPACE\n\nby Taboolaby Taboola\n\nSponsored LinksSponsored Links\n\nPromoted LinksPromoted Links\n\nFROM THE WEB\n\nPro Verbraucher\n\nBestatter packt aus: Anspruch auf Sterbegeld ist vielen unbekanntPro\nVerbraucher\n\naudibene\n\nExpertin warnt: Niemals H\u00f6rger\u00e4te testen ohne diesen Tippaudibene\n\nTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nRentner in Riesa: So kosten Treppenlifte fast nichtsTreppenlift-Vergleich\n\nWomen may have been targeted as more details emerge about Syndey mall attack\nvictims, police say\n\nLakesha Williams charged: Bond set at $25K for mom accused of leaving her\nchildren unattended while on cruise, court records show\n\nWife of Harris County judge accused of killing nephew during fight about\noverstaying welcome\n\nApotheken Magazin\n\nPrivatversichert?
