At the request of the English National\nHealth Service, the senior pediatrician Hilary Cass has completed the most\nthorough consideration yet of this field, and her report calmly and carefully\ndemolishes many common activist tropes. Puberty blockers do have side effects,\nCass found. The evidence base for widely used treatments is \u201cshaky.\u201d Their\nsafety and effectiveness are not settled science.\n\nThe report drew on extensive interviews with doctors, parents, and young\npeople, as well as on a series of new, systematic literature reviews. Its\npublication marks a decisive turn away from the affirmative model of\ntreatment, in line with similar moves in other European countries. What Cass\u2019s\nfinal document finds, largely, is an absence. \u201cThe reality is that we have no\ngood evidence on the long-term outcomes of interventions to manage gender-\nrelated distress,\u201d Cass writes. We also don\u2019t have strong evidence that social\ntransitioning, such as changing names or pronouns, affects adolescents\u2019\nmental-health outcomes (either positively or negatively). We don\u2019t have strong\nevidence that puberty blockers are merely a pause button, or that their\nbenefits outweigh their downsides, or that they are lifesaving care in the\nsense that they prevent suicides. We don\u2019t know why the number of children\nturning up at gender clinics rose so dramatically during the 2010s, or why the\ndemographics of those children changed from a majority of biological males to\na majority of biological females. Neither \u201cborn that way\u201d nor \u201cit\u2019s all social\ncontagion\u201d captures the complexity of the picture, Cass writes.\n\nWhat Cass does feel confident in saying is this: When it comes to alleviating\ngender-related distress, \u201cfor the majority of young people, a medical pathway\nmay not be the best way to achieve this.\u201d That conclusion will now inform the\ncreation of new state-provided services in England. These will attempt to\nconsider patients more holistically, acknowledging that their gender distress\nmight be part of a picture that also includes anxiety, autism, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, eating disorders, or past trauma.\n\nThis is a million miles away from prominent American medical groups\u2019\nrecommendation to simply affirm an adolescent\u2019s stated gender\u2014and from common\npractice at American gender clinics. For example, a Reuters investigation\nfound that, of 18 U.S. clinics surveyed, none conducted the lengthy\npsychological assessments used by Dutch researchers who pioneered the use of\nmedical gender treatments in adolescents; some clinics prescribe puberty\nblockers or hormones during a patient\u2019s first visit. Under pressure from its\nmembers, the American Academy of Pediatrics last year commissioned its own\nevidence review, which is still in progress. But at the same time, the group\nrestated its 2018 commitment to the medical model.\n\nThe Cass report\u2019s findings also contradict the prevailing wisdom at many media\noutlets, some of which have uncritically repeated advocacy groups\u2019 talking\npoints. In an extreme example recently noted by the writer Jesse Singal, CNN\nseems to have a verbal formula, repeated across multiple stories, to assure\nits audience that \u201cgender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-\nbased care.\u201d On a variety of platforms, prominent liberal commentators have\npresented growing concerns about the use of puberty blockers as an ill-\ninformed moral panic.\n\nRead: The power struggle over transgender students\n\nThe truth is that, although American medical groups have indeed reached a\nconsensus about the benefits of youth gender medicine, doctors with direct\nexperience in the field are divided, particularly outside the United States.\n\u201cClinicians who have spent many years working in gender clinics have drawn\nvery different conclusions from their clinical experience about the best way\nto support young people with gender-related distress,\u201d Cass writes. Her report\nis a challenge to the latest standards of care from the U.S.-based World\nProfessional Association for Transgender Health, which declined to institute\nminimum-age limits for surgery. The literature review included with her report\nis notably brutal about these guidelines, which are highly influential in\nyouth gender medicine in America and around the world\u2014but which, according to\nCass, \u201clack developmental rigour.\u201d\n\nThe crux of the report is that the ambitions of youth gender medicine\noutstripped the evidence\u2014or, as Cass puts it, that doctors at the U.K. clinic\nwhose practices she was examining, although well-meaning, \u201cdeveloped a\nfundamentally different philosophy and approach compared to other paediatric\nand mental health services.\u201d How, she asks, did the medical pathway of puberty\nblockers and then cross-sex hormones\u2014a treatment based on a single Dutch study\nin the 1990s\u2014spread around the world so quickly and decisively? Why didn\u2019t\nclinicians seek out more studies to confirm or disprove its safety and utility\nearlier? And what should child gender services look like now?\n\nThe answer to those first two questions is the same. Medicalized gender\ntreatments for minors became wrapped up with a push for wider social\nacceptance for transgender people, something that was presented as the \u201cnext\nfrontier in civil rights,\u201d as Time magazine once described it. Any questions\nabout such care were therefore read as stemming from transphobic hostility,\nfull stop. And when those questions kept coming anyway, right-wing politicians\nand anti-woke comedians piled on, sensing an area where left-wing\nintellectuals were out of touch with popular opinion. In turn, that allowed\nmisgivings to be dismissed as \u201cfascism,\u201d even though, as the British\njournalist Sarah Ditum has written, \u201cit is not damning of feminists that they\nare on the same page as Vladimir Putin about there being two sexes. That is\njust how many sexes there are.\u201d\n\nIn Britain, multiple clinicians working at the Gender Identity and Development\nService (GIDS) at the Tavistock and Portman Trust, the central provider of\nyouth gender medicine, tried to raise their concerns, only to have their fears\ndismissed as hostility toward trans people. Even those who stayed within the\nservice have spoken about pressure from charities and lobbying groups to push\nchildren toward a medical pathway. As Cass notes, \u201cThere are few other areas\nof healthcare where professionals are so afraid to openly discuss their views,\nwhere people are vilified on social media, and where name-calling echoes the\nworst bullying behaviour.\u201d\n\nThis hostile climate has hampered attempts to collect robust data about real-\nworld outcomes. The report\u2019s research team at the University of York tried to\nfollow up on 9,000 former GIDS patients but was informed by National Health\nService authorities in England in January that \u201cdespite efforts to encourage\nthe participation of the NHS gender clinics, the necessary cooperation had not\nbeen forthcoming.\u201d Cass has since wondered aloud if this decision was\n\u201cideologically driven,\u201d and she recommends that the clinics be \u201cdirected to\ncomply\u201d with her team\u2019s request for data.\n\nAs I have written before, the intense polarization of the past few years\naround gender appears to be receding in Britain. Kamran Abbasi, the editor in\nchief of The BMJ, the country\u2019s foremost medical journal, wrote an editorial\npraising the report and echoing its conclusion that many \u201cstudies in gender\nmedicine fall woefully short in terms of methodological rigour.\u201d The country\u2019s\nleft-wing Labour Party has already accepted that feminist concerns about\ngender self-identification are legitimate, and its health spokesperson, Wes\nStreeting, welcomed the Cass report as soon as it was published. (The ruling\nConservatives have also enthusiastically embraced its conclusions, and the\nformer health secretary Sajid Javid pushed through a law change that made its\ndata collection possible.) The LGBTQ charity Stonewall responded to the report\nby saying that some of its recommendations could be \u201cpositive,\u201d and urged\npoliticians to read it. Even Mermaids, the charity most associated with\npushing the affirmative model in Britain, offered only lukewarm criticism that\nmore gatekeeping could further increase waiting times.\n\nThe Cass report is a model for the treatment of fiercely debated social\nissues: nuanced, empathetic, evidence-based. It has taken a political debate\nand returned it to the realm of provable facts. And, unlike American medical\ngroups, its author appears to have made a real effort to listen to people with\nopposing views, and attempted to reconcile their very different experiences of\nthis topic. \u201cI have spoken to transgender adults who are leading positive and\nsuccessful lives, and feeling empowered by having made the decision to\ntransition,\u201d she writes in the introduction. \u201cI have spoken to people who have\ndetransitioned, some of whom deeply regret their earlier decisions.\u201d What a\ndifference from America, where detransitioners are routinely dismissed as\nRepublican pawns and where even researchers who are trans themselves get\npushback for investigating transition-related regret\u2014and where red states have\npassed laws restricting care even for transgender adults, or have proposed\nremoving civil-rights protections from them.\n\nDaniela Valdes and Kinnon McKinnon: Take detransitioners seriously\n\nHas the Cass report gotten everything right? The methodology and conclusions\nof its research should be open to challenge and critique, as with any other\nstudy. But it is undoubtedly the work of serious people who have treated a\ndelicate subject seriously. If you still think that concerns about child\nmedical transition are nothing more than a moral panic, then I have a\nquestion: What evidence would change your mind?\n\nHelen Lewis is a staff writer at The Atlantic.\n\n", "frontpage": false}
