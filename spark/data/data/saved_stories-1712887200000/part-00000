With 5G service it\u2019s easy to do plenty of things\non-the-go that would have been difficult or impossible even with a broadband\nconnection to a home computer two decades ago. But it\u2019s still reliant on being\nclose to cell towers, which isn\u2019t true for all locations. If you\u2019re traveling\noff-grid and want to communicate with others, this guide to using Winlink can\nhelp you send emails using a ham radio.\n\nWhile there are a number of ways to access the Winlink email service, this\nguide looks at a compact, low-power setup using a simple VHF/UHF handheld FM\nradio with a small sound card called a Digirig. The Digirig acts as a modem\nfor the radio, allowing it to listen to digital signals and pass them to the\ncomputer to decode. It can also activate the transmitter on the radio and send\nthe data from the computer out over the airwaves. When an email is posted to\nthe Winlink outbox, the software will automatically send it out to any\nstations in the area set up as a gateway to the email service.\n\nLike the cellular network, the does rely on having an infrastructure of\nreceiving stations that can send the emails out to the Winlink service on the\nInternet; since VHF and UHF are much more limited in range than HF this\nspecific setup could be a bit limiting unless there are other ham radio\noperators within a few miles. This guide also uses VARA, a proprietary\nprotocol, whereas the HF bands have an open source protocol called ARDOP that\ncan be used instead. This isn\u2019t the only thing these Digirig modules can be\nused for in VHF/UHF, though. They can also be used for other digital modes\nlike JS8Call, FT8, and APRS.\n\nPosted in Radio HacksTagged amateur radio, digirig, digital, email, ham radio,\nmobile, QRP, radio, uhf, VHF, Winlink\n\n## 32 thoughts on \u201cEmails Over Radio\u201d\n\n  1. okto says:\n\nApril 9, 2024 at 4:54 pm\n\nWhy use a proprietary protocol when AX.25 has already been the standard for\nthirty years? APRS has email entry nodes, doesn\u2019t involve proprietary\nanything, and leverages an existing network of thousands of nodes\nworldwide\u2014including several HF nodes.\n\nAmateur radio should never involve proprietary algorithms, codecs, or\nprotocols. That is entirely opposed to the entire purpose and spirit of\namateur radio.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. Joshua says:\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 2:26 am\n\nSpeaking of AX.25, there\u2019s FX.25 now. It adds an FEC frame, for better\nreliability. It\u2019s fully backwards compatible, too. Soundmodem and Direwolf\nhave it as an option. Vintage hardware (old TNCs, PTCs etc) doesn\u2019t see FX.25\nand continues working as usual. There\u2019s no special support in the applications\nneeded, also. It\u2019s ideal to bring APRS and Packet-Radio into early 21th\ncentury. :)\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    2. RF Dude says:\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 6:13 am\n\nAX.25 and Aloha are not a hill worth fighting for. 5W on APRS is extremely\nlimited in range due to competing digipeaters doing WIDE3, WX stations with 1m\nupdates, and other OTA abuse. Any improved standard would be a great benefit.\nSure there would be an uptake delay... perhaps even indifference, so a\nreplacement should be faster, more robust, and still inexpensive to implement.\nAND individual HAMS have to see the benefit/incentive to get onboard.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      1.

This causes interference to anyone\nelse who is using the frequency.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. Paul says:\n\nApril 9, 2024 at 7:56 pm\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nAmateur radio regulations are clear, and Winlink plainly reminds you, it is\nthe responsibility of the operator (the one initiating contact with a Winlink\ngateway) to make sure the frequency is clear before transmitting.\n\nWinlink even helps you by displaying an indication if the channel is busy.\n\nAnd, in HF anyway, Winlink maintains and regularly updates a list of gateways\nyou can (probably) work (and therefore HEAR) given current propagation, and\nwon\u2019t even LET you transmit on frequencies you probably can\u2019t hear.\n\nI\u2019d say Winlink is doing its due diligence here.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      1.

Joshua says:\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 6:32 pm\n\nI\u2019m just a CBer, but.. I think it\u2019s still the responsibility of any radio\namateur to make sure transmissions are clean and causing no interference of\nany kind.\n\nAutomated stations have to be supervised by the amateurs who\u2019re maintaining\nthem, too. They can\u2019t be left alone all day, legally speaking.\n\nThe person responsible for a local FM repeater must be around (in reach) to\nmonitor the repeater, strictly speaking, and he/she must be available anytime\n(in person, via radio, phone or e-mail etc).\n\nThat\u2019s necessary, for example, if suddenly troublemakers (licensed or\nunlicensed) do appear on the local repeater and start to misbehave (hate\nspeech, propaganda, utter nonsense).\n\nIn such a situation, the responsible amateur must be available to react ASAP\nand for example, shut the repeater down (fellow amateurs who are standby on\nthe repeater may report the current situation to the amateur in charge who\nthen checks the repeater).\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s not unlike a moderator on a forum or of a comment section.\n\nReport comment\n\n  3. Josiah David Gould says:\n\nApril 9, 2024 at 6:12 pm\n\nI didn\u2019t think you could transmit encrypted anything on amateur bands in the\nUS. How does Winlink get away with being proprietary?\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    1. N1UGK says:\n\nApril 9, 2024 at 7:18 pm\n\nWinlink isn\u2019t encrypted \u2013 the commands to post, list, retrieve, delete, etc\nare in plain text. Winlink command set isn\u2019t obscured or hidden, which is all\nthat is required of any amateur radio protocol. Winlink is similar to any\nother personal bulletin board system found in TNCs for example, except that it\nadds structured routing between nodes.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    2. Paul says:\n\nApril 9, 2024 at 7:45 pm\n\nProprietary does not mean encrypted.\n\nWinlink is neither proprietary or encrypted. Heck, in the interest of\ntransparency they even go so far as to publish on the open web all the (US)\ntraffic it passes.\n\nThe (optional) VARA software modem is proprietary, closed source and sold for\nmoney. Don\u2019t buy it if that irks you, but it has a free tier if you want to\nsit on the fence. If you choose to use the more open, slower protocols you\nmight find some people don\u2019t want to talk to you.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    3. Panondorf says:\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 5:43 am\n\nI could have sworn that the law said something like \u201cYou cannot use codes or\ncyphers meant to obscure the meaning\u201d. The last time I went looking for this\nlanguage I couldn\u2019t find it though. Did Part97 get changed?\n\nI point this out because if that is what the law says... technically it\u2019s not\na ban on encryption. It\u2019s a ban on hiding the meaning of your message. The\ndifference? What if control codes were transmitted using public/private key\nencryption? What if the decryption key was sent clear-text right along with\nthe encrypted content. This could prove the sender is really who they say they\nare as no one else would have that encryption key. But the message would still\nbe readable by anyone who wanted to.\n\nAdd a timestamp to the encrypted portion to prevent replay attacks and this\ncould be useful.\n\nI\u2019ve never heard anyone else talk about encryption in ham radio in this way. I\nthink it would make amateur radio a lot more interesting to the HaD crowd, or\nat least those frequencies which are available for auxiliary station use.\n\nI also think I remember there being a carve out, allowing encryption for the\ncontrol of space stations. But with this you don\u2019t have to do that. Unless...\nthe command being sent to the space station needs to be secret. I\u2019m pretty\nsure I remember reading that this space station carve out had been interpreted\npretty liberally to include things like earth-bound repeaters that weren\u2019t\nconveniently located for a control operator to access directly. Again...\nwouldn\u2019t be necessary. Most repeaters I know of though either just use DTMF\ncodes and trust the only people who even know they are there are other hams\nwho don\u2019t typically want to do bad things to the repeaters.. or they use\nlandlines for the control signals.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      1. TG says:\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 9:55 am\n\nI have heard of this, of people trying to pry open a loophole by using\nencryption (literal translation is \u201cto hide\u201d) to save on bandwidth instead of\nexplicitly to obscure comms. I\u2019m not sure how it worked out for them.\n\nI wonder if anybody tries to encrypt their encrypt so to speak, for example by\nmasking an encrypted datastream by hiding it in background noise of a voice\nconversation\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n        1. Joshua says:\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 6:40 pm\n\nThat reminds me of higher PACTOR modes using compression.\n\nI once read the compression isn\u2019t being allowed on the ham bands.\n\nPACTOR 1 using FSK and no compression is safe to use, though.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n      2. Brian W says:\n\nApril 10, 2024 at 11:52 am\n\nI think you are talking about authentication.\n\nNormally when people talk about \u201cencryption\u201d, they are referring to the use of\ncryptography to protect the confidentiality of data. This is not allowed in\namateur radio.\n\nI am not aware of any rule that prohibits the use of crypto simply to protect\nthe authenticity of data on ham bands.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n  4.

It\u2019s okay if\nthe control signals aren\u2019t human- or machine-legible and are intended for\nmachine use only. You may still have to beacon a callsign every few minutes,\nthough, and many RC controllers with amateur band capability will accept a\nprogrammed callsign and will beacon on your behalf.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n        1.

I remember this, too.\n\nThough I\u2019m more used to homebrew r/c projects using the old 27,12 MHz r/c\nfrequency (used in my place here).\n\nThe frequency was in 11m ISM/CB band and could be used by model makers and\ntinkerers.\n\nBack in the day, even building your own remote control was being allowed, if\nit was being quarz stabilized and if a registration formular was being filled\nout. A small fee was also necessary. If everything went okay, a license then\nwas sent back to you via snail mail.\n\nReport comment\n\nReply\n\n    2.
