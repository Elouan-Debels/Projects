Photograph: Eyebyte/Alamy\n\nStonehenge\n\n# Once-in-a-generation lunar event to shed light on Stonehenge\u2019s links to the\nmoon\n\nArchaeologists and astrologers to study Wiltshire site\u2019s lesser understood\nconnection to the moon\n\nSteven Morris\n\nMon 15 Apr 2024 06.00 CEST\n\nShare\n\nThe rising and setting of the sun at Stonehenge, especially during the summer\nand winter solstices, continues to evoke joy, fascination and religious\ndevotion.\n\nNow a project has been launched to delve into the lesser understood links that\nmay exist between the monument and the moon during a once-in-a-generation\nlunar event.\n\nA \u201cmajor lunar standstill\u201d, which takes place once every 18.6 years, when\nmoonrise and moonset reach their farthest apart points along the horizon, will\ntake place in January 2025.\n\nThis will give archaeologists, astronomers and archaeoastronomers a rare\nchance to explore theories surrounding the event and the ancient people of\nStonehenge. Some experts believe the people who built the monument were aware\nof the major lunar standstill and may have buried their dead in a particular\npart of the site because of its relationship to the phenomenon.\n\nIt is also possible that four \u201cstation stones\u201d forming a rectangle at the site\n\u2013 two of which are still standing \u2013 may have been positioned to mark the major\nlunar standstill.\n\nWithin a year or so either side of a major lunar standstill the moon can be\nseen from time to time rising or setting unusually far to the north or south,\ngiving a healthy window for studies to be made.\n\nEnglish Heritage is planning to livestream the southernmost moonrise and host\na series of events throughout the standstill season, including talks, a pop-up\nplanetarium, stargazing and storytelling sessions and a new display in the\nexhibition space.\n\nClive Ruggles, emeritus professor of archaeoastronomy at Leicester University,\nsaid the alignment of the monument to the sun at midsummer and midwinter meant\nthere was little doubt of its significance to the builders of Stonehenge. \u201cBut\nwhat we\u2019re a lot less clear about is whether there\u2019s any physical connections\nbetween the monument and the moon,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the early phase of Stonehenge, between about 3000 and 2500BC, people\nwere burying the cremated remains of the dead and placing offerings in the\nditch and bank of the henge, and in the so-called Aubrey Holes \u2013 56 pits\nwithin the ditch that may originally have held upright timber posts.\n\nMany of these cremations were concentrated in the south-east of the monument,\nbroadly aligning with the most southerly rising position of the moon.\n\nThe station stones were probably put in place around the same time as the\nlarge sarsen stones as they came from the same spot, West Woods in\nMarlborough.\n\nRuggles said: \u201cThe station stones align with the moon\u2019s extreme positions, and\nresearchers have debated for years whether this was deliberate, and \u2013 if so \u2013\nhow this was achieved and what might have been its purpose.\u201d\n\nHe said it would be no surprise if ancient people did take notice of the moon.\n\u201cPeople have been conscious of the phase cycle of the moon going back tens of\nthousands of years. What I think may have been the case at Stonehenge, and\nthis is what we\u2019re interested to explore, is that around the time of a major\nstandstill people noticed the moon rising or setting unusually far to the\nnorth or south, realised this was something special, and came to venerate and\neventually to monumentalise the directions concerned. You can imagine the\nelders recalling a time when they saw the moon in a sacred direction and then,\na generation later, people\u2019s awe at starting to see this again.\u201d\n\nJennifer Wexler, a Stonehenge historian for English Heritage, said: \u201cWe\u2019re\nexcited to be working with a brilliant team of archaeoastronomers to explore\nthe fascinating link between Stonehenge and the major lunar standstill. This\nopportunity allows us to delve deeper into the monument\u2019s ancient mysteries\nand its relationship with celestial phenomena.\u201d\n\nEnglish Heritage is also working with counterparts at the University of\nColorado, Boulder, and the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s forest service for a\nseries of events comparing lunar alignments at Stonehenge and at Chimney Rock,\nColorado, a Chacoan ancient settlement. \u201cI think it will really surprise\npeople,\u201d said Wexler. \u201cWe\u2019re so focused on the sun at Stonehenge. We almost\nnever mention the moon.\u201d\n\nAmanda Chadburn, an archaeologist and member of Kellogg College, University of\nOxford, said: \u201cObserving this connection first-hand in 2024 and 2025 is\ncrucial. Tracking the moon\u2019s extremes isn\u2019t straightforward, requiring\nspecific timing and weather conditions. We want to understand something of\nwhat it was like to experience these extreme moonrises and sets and to witness\ntheir visual effects on the stones, for example, patterns of light and\nshadow.\u201d\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Stonehenge\n  * Archaeology\n  * The moon\n  * Astronomy\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## Most viewed\n\n## Most viewed\n\n  * UK\n  * UK politics\n  * Education\n  * Media\n  * Society\n  * Law\n  * Scotland\n  * Wales\n  * Northern Ireland\n\n  * News\n  * Opinion\n  * Sport\n  * Culture\n  * Lifestyle\n\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every\nmorning\n\nSign up for our email\n\n  * Help\n  * Complaints & corrections\n  * SecureDrop\n  * Work for us\n  * Privacy policy\n  * Cookie policy\n  * Terms & conditions\n  * Contact us\n\n  * All topics\n  * All writers\n  * Digital newspaper archive\n  * Facebook\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Twitter\n  * Newsletters\n\n  * Advertise with us\n  * Search UK jobs\n\nBack to top\n\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
