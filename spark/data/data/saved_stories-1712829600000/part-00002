So I removed all references\nto it from Sequel's repository a couple weeks ago in e393663  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

There was a treasure trove of prior suggestions and\ndiscussions that were incredibly valuable. I referenced it a few times a week\nsometimes.I'm assuming you still don't have access as an Admin?  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

I guess there are not\nmany options unless we can get our request to unban escalated somehow. :(  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?

So there is a\nfair amount of email archived. The URL is: https://www.mail-\narchive.com/sequel-talk@googlegroups.com/Backscrolling through the date view,\nit only starts around May 2017, but searching yields content back to 2007.\nThis might serve as a reasonable replacement and perhaps would be valuable to\nadd to the documentation.Hopefully, mail-archive doesn't disappear.  \n---  \n  \nBeta Was this translation helpful?
