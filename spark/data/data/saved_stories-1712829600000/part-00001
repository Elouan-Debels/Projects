Let\u2019s try it out with a real story that I wrote\nas a student \u201cjournalist,\u201d many years ago. Let\u2019s use that to investigate the\nhidden biases in AI as it exists today.\n\nI actually wrote this before Uri Berliner wrote his insightful article about\nhuman bias at NPR:\n\n> An open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR, and now, predictably, we\n> don\u2019t have an audience that reflects America.\n>\n> That wouldn\u2019t be a problem for an openly polemical news outlet serving a\n> niche audience. But for NPR, which purports to consider all things, it\u2019s\n> devastating both for its journalism and its business model.\n\nThose same biases infect ChatGPT, and the now-deleted Bard, from Google.\n\n###\n\nMy Brilliant but Short Career in Journalism\n\nWhen I started at the University of Illinois, I had dreams of working on the\nschool paper, something I\u2019d never done in high school. The Daily Illini (or\n\u201cthe DI\u201d as everyone called it) had a recruiting session for incoming\nfreshman, I went to it, and I was hired!\n\nOne of the things they told me right away was that Roger Ebert\n\nhad worked on the DI; in fact, he\u2019d been the editor-in-chief. I said, \u201cWho\u2019s\nRoger Ebert?\u201d He\u2019d graduated and moved on by then.\n\nEven before the Siskel and Ebert TV show, he was locally famous as a movie\ncritic for the Chicago Sun-Times. My bad. I\u2019m so glad I got to tell him that\nstory many years later at a book signing.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize that DI writers were nearly all liberal arts majors who had\nlots of spare time. There were no Engineering majors like me, because those\nguys (they were nearly all guys) had no time at all. I didn\u2019t know that I\ndidn\u2019t, either, until I got the midterm grades for my first semester. They\nactually mailed those to your parents in those days.\n\nWere you imagining I did the adult thing and quit, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I need\nto devote more time to my coursework. It\u2019s been fun and I\u2019ve learned a lot,\nthanks!\u201d ?\n\nOf course not. I was 18 years old. I just quit coming. I hope they were\naccustomed to that kind of behavior from kids. If not: I\u2019m sorry.\n\nAnyhow, I got to do lots of fun things in my brief career as a journalist:\n\n  * I typed a story over the phone from Roger Simon, who went on to fame and fortune as a writer for Politico. This was before the Internet, of course. I don\u2019t remember where he was or what the story was about.\n\n  * I wrote headlines! The main consideration was: will it fit? I needed to fill the available space, but not go over. I had a table of how wide each letter was: \u201cW\u201d and \u201cM\u201d were 2, \u201ci\u201d and \u201cl\u201d were 1/2, and so forth.\n\n  * But most of all, I had a beat to cover! I actually wrote bylined articles (see below).\n\n###\n\nThe Mean Streets: Champaign\n\nThe DI devoted some pages to the local city governments, not just University\naffairs. I imagine this was not a prestige beat that every student wanted, so\na beginning freshman like me still had a shot at it. Champaign was mine!\n\n####\n\nThe Park District\n\nI remember covering a Park Board meeting. If you\u2019ve never gone to one of\nthose: let me tell you, they rank at the very top for high drama. I was on the\nedge of my seat.\n\n> By BOB PURVY\n>\n> D. F. Bresman , president of the Champaign Park board, announced Tuesday\n> that Mr and Mrs. Stanley Kaufman have donated eight acres of land to the\n> Park District. The land is located along Kaufman\u2019s Clear Lake in the western\n> part of the city, and it is expected that the lake itself will be donated at\n> some future date. The lake could be suitable for swimming, among other\n> things, said Commisioner O . F . Bartholow. He indicated that the land will\n> probably not be developed until the lake is donated. The announcement was\n> made at the park board\u2019s monthly meeting, which was delayed a day so that\n> the news could be released at the meeting. It was also announced that a\n> tract of land along Prospect Avenue at the southern limits of Champaign was\n> acquired by the park board. The land, previously unincorporated, was\n> recently annexed by the City of Champaign.\n>\n> The new land increases the acreage of the Champaign Park District to 345.\n> This represents a 225 per cent increase in the last five years. New lands\n> are almost always added by donations of private citizens, because the Park\n> District does not have the money to buy land outright. Board President\n> Bresnan said, \u201dChampaign has less park acreage than most downstate cities of\n> its size . Decature [sic] residents have six times more acreage than\n> Champaign residents for park purposes . The gift is the beginning of the\n> Greenbelt idea proposed by the University in 1965.\n\nAs an example of journalistic objectivity, what does ChatGPT say about my work\nhere?\n\n> In analyzing the article for journalistic bias, we should consider several\n> factors such as language choices, tone, framing, sources, and omissions.\n>\n> Language and Tone: The language used in the article seems neutral and\n> straightforward, without obvious loaded terms or emotionally charged\n> language. However, phrases like \"The gift is the beginning of the Greenbelt\n> idea proposed by the University in 1965\" could be interpreted as subtly\n> promoting the idea, though it's not overtly biased.\n\nThanks for reading Life Since the Baby Boom!

Those same biases led Bard, the defunct Google AI entry, to\nproduce this:\n\nThose Asian women and black men who served in the German Army in 1943 are so\nunder-represented.\n\n##### A bias towards portraying the donation and conservation efforts\npositively\n\nWell, duh. Let me see if I can satisfy it and rewrite that (additions in\nbold):\n\n> D. F. Bresman , president of the Champaign Park board, announced Tuesday\n> that the wealthy Mr and Mrs. Stanley Kaufman have donated eight acres of\n> land to the Park District.

The gift is the beginning of the\n> controversial Greenbelt idea proposed by the University in 1965, although\n> some say there has been little follow-through on this.\n\nRats! Now I\u2019ve made it even worse:\n\n> In this article, there are several elements that could indicate potential\n> journalistic bias:\n>\n> Language and Tone: The language used, particularly in describing the donors\n> as \"wealthy,\" may imply a certain level of privilege associated with their\n> donation. This could subtly influence readers' perceptions of the Kaufmans\n> and their motivations for donating the land.\n>\n> Framing: The article frames the donation of land by the Kaufmans as a\n> positive development for the Champaign Park District, highlighting the\n> increase in acreage and the potential benefits of acquiring land along Clear\n> Lake. However, the mention of the controversial nature of the Greenbelt idea\n> proposed by the University in 1965 introduces a hint of skepticism or\n> criticism towards the broader initiative, which may not fully align with the\n> overall positive tone of the article.\n>\n> Sources: The primary source cited in the article is D. F. Bresman, president\n> of the Champaign Park board. While Bresman provides valuable information\n> about the donation and its significance, it's important to consider\n> potential biases associated with his role as a representative of the Park\n> District.\n>\n> Omissions: One potential omission is the absence of perspectives from\n> individuals or groups who may have concerns or criticisms about the\n> acquisition of land by the Park District or the broader Greenbelt\n> initiative. Including such perspectives could provide a more balanced\n> understanding of the implications and challenges associated with these\n> developments.\n>\n> Overall, while the article presents the donation of land by the Kaufmans in\n> a generally positive light, there are elements that could indicate potential\n> bias, particularly in the framing and language choices. To provide a more\n> comprehensive and balanced view, the article could benefit from including a\n> wider range of perspectives and addressing potential criticisms or concerns.\n\nSo I asked it: can you rewrite this to be fair and unbiased? It did.\n\n> D. F. Bresman, president of the Champaign Park board, announced Tuesday that\n> Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Kaufman have generously donated eight acres of land to\n> the Park District. The land, situated along Kaufman\u2019s Clear Lake in the\n> western part of the city, is expected to enhance the park district's\n> recreational offerings. Commissioner O. F. Bartholow remarked that the\n> donation includes a lake that could potentially be utilized for swimming and\n> other activities. It was also announced at the park board\u2019s monthly meeting\n> that a tract of land along Prospect Avenue at the southern limits of\n> Champaign was acquired by the park board. This land, previously\n> unincorporated, was recently annexed by the City of Champaign.\n>\n> The addition of the donated land increases the acreage of the Champaign Park\n> District to 345, marking a significant expansion over the last five years.\n> It's worth noting that new lands are often acquired through donations from\n> private citizens due to financial constraints faced by the Park District in\n> outright land purchases.\n>\n> Board President Bresnan emphasized the importance of the donation,\n> highlighting that Champaign lags behind other downstate cities of similar\n> size in terms of park acreage. He referenced Decatur residents having\n> significantly more park acreage, underscoring the need for such\n> contributions to bolster the local park system.\n>\n> Additionally, the donation is viewed as a step towards the implementation of\n> the Greenbelt idea proposed by the University in 1965. However, there are\n> differing opinions on the progress made towards this initiative, with some\n> suggesting there has been limited follow-through.\n>\n> Overall, the donation of land by the Kaufmans and the acquisition along\n> Prospect Avenue represent positive developments for the Champaign Park\n> District, providing opportunities for expanded recreational activities and\n> potentially contributing to the realization of longstanding community\n> initiatives.\n\nI don\u2019t recall who at the DI, if anyone, edited my article, but I\u2019d hope he\nwould have cut the bold parts, maybe asking, \u201cWho the hell asked you to\nevaluate this donation? Or the University\u2019s Greenbelt idea? And who cares\nabout people\u2019s \u2018perspectives\u2019 on it? Just write the facts, little freshman\nperson.\u201d It was fine the way I had it.\n\n###\n\nNot All \u201cJournalists\u201d Buy Into This\n\nThe Stanford Daily published a debate on this. Here are some highlights:\n\n> Wesley Lowery, who has served as a national correspondent for the Washington\n> Post, has been a prominent voice in the moral clarity versus objectivity\n> debate.\n>\n> Lowery wrote in a tweet, \u201cAmerican view-from-nowhere,\n> \u201cobjectivity\u201d-obsessed, both-sides journalism is a failed experiment...The\n> old way must go. We need to rebuild our industry as one that operates from a\n> place of moral clarity.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the New York Times weighed in as well. An excerpt:\n\n> \u201cWe focus on fairness and fact-checking and accuracy, and we don\u2019t try to\n> suggest to our students that opinions they have should be hidden ,\u201d said\n> Sarah Bartlett, the dean of the City University of New York Craig Newmark\n> Graduate School of Journalism. \u201cWe embrace transparency.\u201d\n>\n> Steve Coll, her counterpart at Columbia, who announced on Thursday that he\n> was stepping down in June after nine years as dean, said that Columbia\n> Journalism School tries to teach fairness and intellectual honesty \u2014 adding\n> that the old way of thinking has morphed into something new. \u201cThe church is\n> gone, and there\u2019s no orthodoxy left,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s many journalisms,\n> and that\u2019s kind of liberating.\u201d\n\nWhat utter crap. \u201cMoral clarity\u201d means \u201cmy opinion is better than yours.\u201d And\nyes, your opinion should be hidden.\n\n####\n\nMaybe We Have Our Answer\n\nGallup tells us that trust in the media is near an all-time low.\n\nThis viewpoint that denigrates objectivity as \u201cbothsidesism\u201d is completely an\nelite belief. The public doesn\u2019t share it.\n\n> A little more than half of the journalists surveyed (55%) say that every\n> side does not always deserve equal coverage in the news. By contrast, 22% of\n> Americans overall say the same, whereas about three-quarters (76%) say\n> journalists should always strive to give all sides equal coverage\n\n####\n\nBut...\n\nDid I just contradict myself? I and my editor rejected the notion that this\nland donation should be examined for \u201cboth sides\u201d i.e.\n\n  * Maybe it was not a good thing?\n\n  * Maybe the University\u2019s \u201cgreenbelt\u201d idea wasn\u2019t being implemented?\n\nUnfortunately, journalism is not mathematics and there are establishment\nbeliefs, \u201cdonating land to the public is good\u201d being one of them. Some issues\ndo have two sides (minorities\u2019 treatment by the police, the Vietnam War\u2019s\njustification) and there is a need to present both. Others do not, and the\nreading public isn\u2019t normally interested in the writer inventing one.\n\nThanks for reading Life Since the Baby Boom!

Located\n> at 201 E . Park St., Champaign, in what formerly was a church, it has been\n> open since Sept. 21 and now has a membership of 180 boys.\n>\n> About 60 boys attend the center daily, David Lawrence, executive director,\n> said. The club has a gymnasium, game room, library, woodshop, arts and\n> crafts laboratory, and a small radio station for the use of its members.\n> Much of the equipment still is being installed, although the center already\n> is in use.\n>\n> The club has two full-time professionals supervising activities. Volunteer\n> workers from the community and from Volunteer Illini Projects and paid part-\n> time workers in the college work-study program also help staff the club.\n> Because of its location in Champaign\u2019s near North End 80 per cent of the\n> members are black Lawrence stressed that every effort is being made to\n> maintain and, if possible, increase the number of white youths .\n>\n> Bus cards are provided for boys living a considerable distance away,\n> enabling them to ride the buses free of charge. The directors hope an\n> integrated group will create a more healthy atmosphere. A more healthy\n> atmosphere is one of the principal aims of the program. Lawrence said the\n> club will work closely with the families, schools and churches. Parental\n> consent is requested before a boy can join the Boys Club. Parents are\n> notified when they can expect their boy home and boys are required to leave\n> at what the supervisor feels is a reasonable hour.\n>\n> Lawrence said he doesn\u2019t let the boys do whatever they want while at the\n> club, but rather plans recreation for them. In this way he hopes to provide\n> more balanced and beneficial activities for the boys.\n>\n> Tutors also are available for boys who have difficulty in school. The Boys\n> Club however, by no means is a counselling office, Lawrence said. The\n> majority of boys need no help from the staff , and come just for the fun of\n> it . He hopes these boys will help the members who do need it .\n>\n> WPGU\n>\n> Radio station WPGU located on the University campus, this week donated more\n> than 500 records to the Champaign-Urbana Boys Club. The records, provided by\n> WPGU through Music Director Rick Sallinger, will be used in conjunction with\n> the club radio station. One of the newest ideas attempted at any boys club\n> in the nation, the station is piped throughout the building and eventually\n> will broadcast outside by way of external speakers.\n>\n> Under direction of UI math major Denny Werner, the station BCCU ( Boys Club\n> of ChampaignUrbana), is used as a training ground for those interested in\n> radio-tv. Programming consists of a variety of music and athletic events.\n>\n> Executive Director Dave Lawrence pointed out that since opening only last\n> September the club must depend on the services of existing community\n> functions such as WPGU. The club has a current enrollment of approximately\n> 200 members with an average of four to six members joining each week. BCCU\n> is located at the Champaign-Urbana Boys Club at 201 E . Park St., Champaign,\n> and serves the community\u2019s predominantly Negro North End although membership\n> is not limited by race.\n\n### Subscribe to Life Since the Baby Boom\n\nBy Albert Cory \u00b7 Launched 2 years ago\n\nAmusing stuff from a Boomer Fl\u00e2neur in high tech\n\nShare this post\n\n#### AI Does Journalism\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\nShare\n\nComments\n\nNo Source Code == No Patent\n\nHow we know you \"have' the invention\n\nApr 17, 2023 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n4\n\nShare this post\n\n#### No Source Code == No Patent\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n10\n\nBring Back Private Offices\n\nOpen Office Sucks\n\nMar 4 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n19\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Bring Back Private Offices\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n14\n\nWorking at Google: Maps\n\n\"Oh, I Love Google Maps!\"\n\nFeb 13, 2023 \u2022\n\nAlbert Cory\n\n5\n\nShare this post\n\n#### Working at Google: Maps\n\nalbertcory50.substack.com\n\n3\n\nReady for more?\n\n\u00a9 2024 Albert Cory\n\nPrivacy \u2219 Terms \u2219 Collection notice\n\nStart WritingGet the app\n\nSubstack is the home for great writing\n\nShare\n\n## Create your profile\n\n## Only paid subscribers can comment on this post\n\nAlready a paid subscriber?
