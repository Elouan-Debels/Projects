Much of this\nsoftware is rarely reevaluated, reinvigorated, or reanimated.\n\nIn 2019 a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the\nfederal government spends more than $100 billion on IT and cyber-related\ninvestments annually. Of this amount, agencies have typically spent about 80%\non the operations and maintenance of existing IT investments, including legacy\nsystems.^1 Enterprises find themselves in a similar situation.\n\n> On average, 31% of an organization\u2019s technology is made up of legacy\n> systems.\n\nMaintaining those systems can be a costly burden, with an average of 60-80% of\nIT budgets allocated to keeping them running.^2 A 2018 Deloitte survey found\nthat the average enterprise spends 57 percent of its IT budget on supporting\nbusiness operations and only 16 percent on boosting innovation.^3 The 16%\nspent on innovation is only 25% as effective as it could be because of the\noverheads of working with inflexible legacy systems such as the extra costs of\ntesting or building scaffolding to the legacy systems. Organizations would be\nable to innovate much faster and keep up with customer demands if they had the\nability to spend even 50% of their budget on innovation and be 100% productive\nwith that spend.\n\n## The Present\n\nLegacy technologies hamper efficiencies and restrict growth in an estimated\n88% of businesses.^4 In many global 2000 companies, most of whom have been in\nexistence for decades, one of today\u2019s greatest technology challenges lies in\nthe large body of legacy systems. Exacerbating this challenge, developers who\nunderstand how to maintain these systems may have transitioned to working on\nmore modern technology, or are contemplating retirement. Many of these systems\nrun on obsolete or unsupported platforms. For some, the source code is lost.\n\nLift-and-shift to the cloud is not an option for many of these systems and\nmodernizing them is not trivial. It isn\u2019t uncommon to see mission critical\nsystems operating this way with one band-aid solution layered on top of\nanother.\n\n#### Some of the impacts of relying on frozen legacy systems are:\n\nInnovation Opportunity Cost - Organizations are severely impaired in their\nability to effectively respond to evolving customer demands instead spending\ntime and resources attempting to keep legacy systems alive. They miss the\nopportunity to take advantage of the latest technology which might allow them\nto operate a similar system that is more manageable and upgradeable, and that\nmight allow IT teams to add modern features to improve efficiency, lower risk,\nreduce costs, and be responsive to a rapidly changing market.\n\nBusiness Risk - As these systems age and get harder to maintain the\nprobability of system failure increases. Typically these systems are mission\ncritical and any downtime has a costly business impact.\n\nSecurity Risk - Legacy systems run code or rely on libraries that might\ncontain known security vulnerabilities with no way to patch these. Dated,\ninsecure code increases the attack surface for a business. This not only\nincreases the risk of a cybersecurity incident which could result in sensitive\ndata being stolen and the ensuing fallout, but it also has real and present\ncosts in terms of higher insurance premiums. In its 2019 study of several\ncritical federal government systems, GAO noted that several of the legacy\nsystems were operating with known security vulnerabilities and unsupported\nhardware and software.\n\nTechnology and Talent Risk - Legacy systems often require older hardware or\nsoftware tools to support them. As the rest of the industry moves away from\nthese systems, businesses must rely on a shrinking number of vendors with\ninordinate market power. Similarly, the talent pool available to maintain\nthese obsolete systems and platforms shrinks due to retirement and a lack of\nnew developers entering the space.\n\nThere are an estimated 240 billion lines of COBOL in operation in America. The\ncommunity of COBOL programmers is shrinking faster than the open positions\nthey create can be filled. The average age of a COBOL programmer is 58, and\nroughly 10% are retiring each year. It is estimated that there were 84,000\nunfilled mainframe positions in 2020, and that number goes up every year.^5\nGAO reported instances where federal government agencies were using systems\nthat had components that were at least 50 years old or the vendors were no\nlonger providing support for hardware or software. Similarly, in June 2019 GAO\nreported that several of the federal government's most critical legacy systems\nused outdated languages, had unsupported hardware and software, and were\noperating with known security vulnerabilities.^1\n\nEmployee Motivation and Attrition - Research suggests that 91% of employees\nare frustrated with workplace technology. A significant amount of frustration,\n57%, stems from legacy technology. Amidst the current talent war 71% of\nmanagers say employees will switch jobs if they don\u2019t have the tools to do\ntheir jobs well.^6\n\nProductivity Losses - Studies in the UK indicate that 48% of the study\npopulation wasted 3 hours or more per day due to inefficient systems. Slow,\nold technology impairs employee productivity.^7\n\nSquandered Data - Most enterprises are adopting big data analytics to guide\nbusiness decisions. Legacy systems do not lend themselves to easy data\nextraction, leading to data silos and incomplete data for reports. An\nestimated 62 billion data and analytic work hours are lost annually worldwide\ndue to such analytic inefficiencies, according to the \u2018Data and Analytics in a\nDigital-First World\u2019 Report.^4\n\nCosts - U.S. business and government spending on technology products, services\nand staff was estimated at USD 2 trillion in 2022.^8 By conservative\ncalculations at least $1.14 trillion is spent on maintenance of existing IT\ninvestments including legacy systems. The cost of maintaining legacy systems\nbecomes a drag on a nation\u2019s economy and can hinder innovation over time.\n\n## The Future\n\nWorldwide investment in Digital Transformation for 2022-2024 is expected to be\n$6.3 trillion per IDC^9, which indicates the urgency enterprises are\nexperiencing to rid themselves of the shackles of legacy systems. Many of\nthese projects will fail, the investment wasted.\n\n> Research from the Boston Consulting Group shows that 70% of all digital\n> transformation projects fail.^10\n\nBjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, stated \"Legacy code often differs from its\nsuggested alternative by actually working and scaling.\u201d^11 Drawing inspiration\nfrom Bjarne\u2019s observation, Mechanical Orchard recognizes that legacy systems\nthat have survived the test of time often have valuable patterns that should\nbe studied and replicated on a modern stack running on an easy-to-manage,\nsecure, and scalable cloud environment. Hence an older mission critical\nsystem, which is next to impossible to change, and weighs down the\norganization like a boat anchor, is turned into a powerful sail that pulls the\norganization into the future.\n\n#### Contact Us.\n\n### Conversation\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
