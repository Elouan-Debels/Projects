One lunchtime I borrowed some one\u2019s Amiga (probably Gary\u2019s, although\nit might have been a spare), and set about trying to prove him wrong. The\nresulting image is shown above, which only took an hour or so to make. I\ncreated the men at the bottom, the gun, and the 10 ton weight. Once everyone\nhad seen it had a good old laugh, Gary Timmons added the mouth, the clapping\nhand and the rotating thing \u2013 and everyone had another chuckle.\n\nGary also made significant improvements to the character, and you can see\nGary\u2019s almost complete lemming, just right of the chewing mouth. My one, is a\nbit \u201cstiff\u201d, while Gary\u2019s is clearly the one that was used in the game.\n\nMy Walker on the left, and Gary\u2019s improved one on the right.\n\nIt was actually Russell Kay (author of PC lemmings), that first laughed\n\u201cThere\u2019s a game in that!\u201d rather than Dave Jones, he\u2019s also the one that did\nthe first demo which was shown to Psygnosis in late September of 1989 at the\nPCW show. It was also Russell that coined the phrase \u201cLemmings\u201d when talking\nabout these little guys.\n\nThe Original Demo Disk\n\nThe demo itself came about for a couple of reasons; first I had just done the\nanimation, and Russell was keen to use the little guys in something, but the\nsecond reason is probably the more interesting.\n\nRussell and Dave were having a discussion about weapons in Blood Money, and\nDave was thinking of adding \u201csalamander\u201d style missiles that followed the\nlandscape, but didn\u2019t really know how best to implement it. Russell however,\nhad figured out a way, and used the Lemmings to demonstrate it. Dave decided\nagainst it though, and added the bombs that are in there today.\n\nThere\u2019s been much debate over the choice of colours as well, but the colours\nwere selected, not because they were the easiest to choose, but because of the\nPC EGA palette. With the limited choice, it was decided the green hair was\nnicer than blue, and with that, the final Lemming was born.\n\nI was actually the next person to code up a demo on the Commodore 64, but I\nonly got so far as having a single Lemming walking over the landscape before\nDave put me onto another project.\n\nThe Lemmings Editor\n\nDave was now at a lose end after just losing the race to build the first Amiga\nAction Replay cartridge, and so decided he now had time to start another game,\nand finally picked Lemmings \u2013 which is probably the best decision he ever\nmade.\n\nAfter coding the defender style explosion, Brian Watson ( who wrote most of\nthe Atari ST version \u2013 I started it... he did most of it), almost fell\nbackwards off his chair laughing!\n\nGary did all the animations, and Scott drew all the background. This was\nmainly because Gary insisted that he couldn\u2019t draw backgrounds, so Scott\nproduced the first earth and rock style, and Dave decided to let him do them\nall. Gary meanwhile, set about creating the animations the game needed.\n\nDeliuxe Paint\n\nThe level editor was built around the Deluxe Paint interface; a program\neveryone at DMA was very familiar with. It was incredibly easy to use, and\nbeing built directly into the game it allowed for a very quick turn around on\nlevel creation. Dave needed floppy disk routines for his editor, so dragooned\nBrian into writing them, however there were reliability problems, so Dave took\nit over and DMA Dos was born. This was a full set of disk routines, controlled\nfrom a command line program to read/write etc. I wish I stull had this command\nline program!\n\nGary, Scot and myself were the ones that did the bulk of the levels, But Dave\ndid manage to sneak a couple in as well; although it was probably because he\ntold us too and we couldn\u2019t really argue with him.\n\nHaving said that, it did take him ages to get any that were even worth while\nconsidering! He used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger\nat the screen and saying \u201cThere! Beat that!\u201d, we\u2019d calmly point out a totally\nnew way of getting around all his traps, and doing it in a much simpler\nmethod. \u201cOh...\u201d, he\u2019d mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it.\n\nOf course, this was the beauty of Lemmings; there were so many ways of\ncompleting a level. I can\u2019t remember if anyone else managed to get levels into\nthe final game, Steve tried hard but just couldn\u2019t get to grips with it, so\nfailed to get any levels in. He did manage to get some levels into later\nversion though\n\nWe all actually had great fun doing levels, and were always trying to beat\neach other by doing the most fiendish design we could. This never happened of\ncourse, and by the end of Lemmings we were all so good at the game, it would\nonly be a matter of seconds before we figured out how to complete a new level.\n\nIt\u2019s Hero Time!\n\nWe did manage to fox Psygnosis now and then, and I can lay claim that it took\nJohn White an hour to figure out \u201cIt\u2019s hero time\u201c. When ever Psygnosis did\nsome testing, we\u2019d get back a fax with the level name, time taken to complete,\nand some comments and a difficulty rating. These were usually around 3-6\nminutes, and some general comments on how they found it.\n\nEvery now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the\ntime and comment\u2019s crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving\nfor while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy\nfeeling inside.\n\nHunt the Nessy \u2013 I loved how this looked in the mini map at the bottom\n\nYou could always tell the levels Gary did, as they were very minimal, a few\nblocks and that was about it. My own (and Scott\u2019s to some degree) tended to\nlook like pictures, or at the very least pretty. Scott\u2019s levels tended to be\npacked together better than mine, but I liked drawing huge levels; \u201cHunt the\nNessy\u201d and \u201cThe Steel Mines of Kessel\u201d were mine for example.\n\nThis was the kind of level Gary presented to us, and although challenging,\nthey were never pretty.And this was what it looked like after Dave told Gary\nto go and improve them.\n\nI also loved making the user do multiple things at once. \u201cThe Fast Food\nKitchen\u201d was one of mine, and required the player to jump back and forth to\ncomplete the level.\n\nThe Fast Food Kitchen\n\nAfter I created the \u201cThe Art Gallery\u201d Dave did in fact tell Gary to go and\nmake them a bit more pretty, as he could now see what was possible, and\ncouldn\u2019t imagine people paying for bland looking levels, and 3 blocks on\nscreen was just that. So Gary went off and put lots of fluff around the edges\nto make them more appealing, but nothing that interfered with the playing of\nhis level.\n\nThe Art Gallery\n\nYou can see examples of this in levels like \u201c Lemmingology\u201c , \u201cWe all fall\ndown\u201d and \u201cAll or Nothing\u201d. All of these have very simple play areas, while\nthe surrounding detail is meaning-less to the level itself. Still, it didn\u2019t\nstop Gary from producing some great levels.\n\nI also liked to give small clue\u2019s in the name( \u201cIt\u2019s Hero Time\u201d referring to a\nsingle Lemming going \u2018over the top\u2019 as it were), while Gary used to try and\nmake clever references to things (\u201cI have a cunning plan\u201d \u2013 Black Adder),\nwhere as Scott just tended to make up nice sounding names. Of course we all\ndid a bit of everything, my \u201cThe Island of the Wicker people\u201d being a\nreference to a line from Batman.\n\nAll of Nothing\n\nI should also mention here, that Gary did push the engine quite a bit with one\nof this levels \u201cAll of Nothing\u201d. Lemmings would fall into a single pixel\nspace, and would all stack up on top of each other, and you\u2019d have to click\nthe right one, going in the right direction to solve the level. Most would end\nup solving this level by pure chance, but Dave refused to put in any level\nthat could only be solved by chance.\n\nGary however, had discovered, that if you place the cursor on the opposite\nside of the way you were wanting to click, the cursor would \u201cflash\u201d briefly\nwhen a lemming was under it, and if you clicked at that exact moment, it would\nselect that lemming \u201cjust\u201d as he turned around. Using this method, Gary showed\nthe level could be done perfectly \u2013 every time, so Dave let the level in. In\nretrospect, I suspect it probably shouldn\u2019t have gone in, as 99.999999% of\npeople would have solved this level through pure luck and frustration.\n\nI was also the one responsible for creating all the \u201ccustom\u201d levels for the\ngame. We picked games that used the Amiga\u2019s dual-playfield system as they only\nused 16 colours, this ruled out games like Blood Money which was a full 32\ncolours. We did a test with a Menace level since we already had all the\ngraphics to that, and once we saw how this looked, we went hunting for others.\n\nFun: A Beast of a Level\n\nTaxing: MENACING\n\nAn AWESOME Level\n\nA Beast II of a Level\n\nWe were then lucky enough to get some graphics from Psygnosis and Reflections\nfor Beast, Beast II and Awesome which then made up the rest of these levels.\nThe special levels were very basic, as they couldn\u2019t have traps of any kind\n(due partly to the change in colour palette), which meant I had to try and\nmake hard levels using only the skills and backgrounds only; never an easy\nthing to do.\n\nAs we started to close in on a final version, Dave said he\u2019d pay us \u00a310 for\nevery level that got in \u2013 splashing the big bucks! I got 16 levels in so got a\nwhopping \u00a3160. Most levels were used at least twice \u2013 once for hard, and then\nby adding more skills, a simpler version was then made. Interestingly.... I\ncan\u2019t remember getting any kind of bonus for lemmings like I did for Ballistix\nand Blood Money, perhaps Gary did.....\n\nJust Dig\n\nThe problem was now that we had all these really hard levels, but no easy\nones. So, Gary then set about making simple ones; either by making easier\nversions of hard ones, or brand new levels. Levels like \u201cJust Dig\u201d (Lemmings\nlevel 1) were example of the new, simple levels. Designed to ease the player\nin, these levels were so simple, that some under 5\u2019s managed to play the first\nfew levels unaided.\n\nThis I believe is where many games fall down today, they don\u2019t spend the time\nmaking a good learning curve. Its also one of the reasons why I think the game\ndid so well, everyone could do at least a few levels.\n\n2 player lemmings\n\nI\u2019ve since met many people that were around 6 or 7 years old at the time, who\nhave told me they used to play it. There have been very few games with such a\ncross section of players; Mario games are the only other ones I can think of\nsince not even the Sonic games are played by such a wide cross section of\nages.\n\nThe music and particularly the sound effects have to get a mention, so crucial\nto were they to the game. Both were created by Brian Johnson (Scott\u2019s younger\nbrother), and the reason the tunes were, well \u2013 basic, was to avoid any\ncopyright problems.\n\n2 player status bar\n\nThis was around the time when games first started to worry about such things,\nwhere as before they would have just happily ripped them off, but not now.\nThis is why were were stuck with such timeless classics as \u201cHow much was that\ndoggie in the window?\u201d etc. However, I do seem to recall that Gary Timmons did\nthe intro music, for some reason. Speaking of that tune however.... it turned\nout this one is still in copyright! Who knew! Well, the owners did! They sued\nPsygnosis and they had to settle with them for the use of the song. I don\u2019t\nthink it was that much in the grand scheme of things, but no one realised\nso....\n\nThe sound effects were superb however and deserve a special mention, since the\ngame wouldn\u2019t have been the same without them. Scott\u2019s mum Carol, was the\nfirst voice of the lemmings, and while they got sped up a little, they were\npretty much unchanged. Years later a DMA Employee (and another Uni friend of\nDave\u2019s), Alastair Houston, managed to a pretty fair impersonation of a\nLemming.\n\nThe other great thing with the original lemmings was the 2 player option. This\ncame about because of games like Populous and Stunt Car Racer. These were the\ngames we were playing in the office at the time, and they were the first to\nuse Null-Modem cables for multi-player action. Gary created all 20 two player\nlevels used in the game, these had different goals from the single player\nlevels, so required a bit more thought.\n\nWe tried this as well, and I actually coded up a Null-Modem cable routine up\non my Amiga, and even managed to get a mouse moving around on Dave\u2019s A2000\nmachine, being controlled by me on mine. However, since the Amiga could have 2\nmice plugged in, Dave decided to go with the split screen option instead.\n\nAtari ST Lemmings\n\nThis was a great addition, and one I\u2019ve been very sorry not to see again\nsince. On the PC however, all mice were controlled by DOS drivers and they\nwere hardwired to a single port. This meant PC had simply couldn\u2019t control\nmore than once mouse at all, so it was dropped from that version, but the\nAtari ST version did managed to retain it.\n\nSpeaking of the Atart ST version, after doing the front end and coms test,\nDave set me doing the ST version. I really didn\u2019t have much experience with\nthe ST, just doing some basic demos when Brian had loaned me his machine, but\nI knew enough 68000 to get going, and Wayne Smithson of WJS Design was good\nenough to help me out getting interrupt driven mouse and keyboard working.\n\nThe Arcade version of Lemmings\n\nAfter that, I spent some time writing an ST replacement for Dave\u2019s \u201cBlit\u201d\nfunction, which was his blitter code. That way I could take the Amiga 68000\ncode directly, and it should \u201cjust work\u201d. I got the levels being loaded and\ndrawn and finally got a Lemming walking over the background when Dave pulled\nme from this to work on Shadow of the Beast on the PC Engine, and this port\nwas given over to Brian. He pretty much rewrote everything I think, but it\ngave him a good start\n\nWhen the Arcade machine was being written, the CEO of Data East apparently\nwouldn\u2019t start a meeting without challenging the person to a 2 player version\nof lemmings (according to Dave that is).\n\nI\u2019ve never been quite sure why no one has ever done a proper multiplayer\nLemmings game since, and these days with and internet connection, it would be\na great game to play.\n\nThe arcade version is also where the fast forward of Lemmings 2 came from,\nonce we saw it in the Arcade version, we realised we just had to have it. It\u2019s\nnow very hard to play the original Lemmings without the fast forward. The\narcade version was controlled with the joystick or a trackball and was still\nin the very early stages when it was cancelled. I still have the original\nprototype here, rescued from the skip when DMA moved from Dundee to Edinburgh.\n\nAnother little known fact, was that Psygnosis also did a book of solutions,\nwritten by Mark Tsai (current owner of Lemmings.com), and A.J. Aranyosi, it\nincluded 16 new levels from the \u201coh no, More lemmings\u201d level set. This book is\nnow well out of print, but is ISBN:1-55958-188-3 in case you want to look for\nit. It was printed in black and white pages, and gave detailed descriptions on\nhow to complete each level from Lemmings and the new bonus levels.\n\nFrontEnd Lemming\n\nThe Lemmings front end was also going to look very different initially. We\ncame up with the idea of lemmings holding up cards, like in stadiums to spell\nstuff out. The rest of the lemmings were going to be doing lots of other funny\nanimations. So I set about doing this. I had a screen full of lemmings, all\nanimating differently, and some holding up cards. This was neat, but\nconfusing... so it was eventually dropped.\n\nThe official drawings were done by Gary, however they were done well after the\ngame was underway. They had to be drawn since Psygnosis kept asking us what\nthey really looked like for boxes and adverts, and we couldn\u2019t tell them. So\nGary knocked up these sketches to give them the basic idea.\n\nOriginal Lemmings Concept Drawings by Gary Timmons\n\nAll the 6\u2019s....\n\nWe also received various comments back from the public, one of which sent our\neyes rolling! The level 666 was received very badly in places, since many\nthought this was a direct effort to put the devil over as being \u201ccool\u201d or\nwhatever.\n\nHowever, it all started out as me trying to get a level full of \u201cfives\u201d, but\nwhile I could get 55 of each skill, 5min, 55 seconds for the timer, I couldn\u2019t\nget 55% of lemmings to save; only 66% (it has since been pointed out that if\nI\u2019d change the number of lemmings, I could have easily gotten 55%). So it\nchanged to 6. Then since it was in the hell level, I though of 666.\n\nI never thought it would cause quite the stir it did, although I still say\nyour helping them escaping from hell it to a far better land\n\nLastly the DMA Design logo used in this game was created by Geoff Gunning \u2013 a\nschool friend of mine, who drew on Dave\u2019s request. Dave had this idea about\nanimating it later on so wanted these 2 characters facing each other \u201cready to\nfight\u201d.\n\nGeoff never really liked it, but Dave was paying him so.... Geoff never put it\non the computer, that was done by Scott, I then spent days anti-aliasing it\nall and smoothing it out.\n\nLemmings Intro\n\nOn launch day, Psygnosis would phone almost every hour telling Dave the latest\nsales figures. 10,000! 20,000! 30,000! 35,000! 45,000! In the end, the game\nwould ship over 55,000 copies of the Amiga version in the first day alone. To\nput this into some sort of perspective, Dave\u2019s first game Menace sold a\nwhopping 20,000 copies, while Blood Money sold double that at 40,000. This was\nthe full life of the product, and not first day sales!\n\nIt has since been estimated that the sales of the original Lemmings, after all\nthe conversions had been done would have topped a whopping 15,000,000 copies\nworldwide. Very few games, even in today\u2019s mass market climate, sell anywhere\nnear this amount.\n\nMy original Lemming art\n\nWhen you finished, you were presented with the picture below. We had received\na load of shop PR material up, and I had been drawing some it. Dave then came\nup with the idea of using the Amiga\u2019s GenLock to composite a \u201cwell done\u201d\nscreen. Scot game me the lemming logo to add on, and then Dave Loaded the\nLemming onto the GenLock screen and we\u2019d sit in front of the camera, and we\u2019d\nget told to lift our hands higher... lower... etc. Gary then composited the\npicture together. If you look really closely, you can see my initials on the\nLemming at the bottom.\n\nHe then got everyone to clap and cheer and he played this back with the\nmessage below. End sequences weren\u2019t huge back then, but this was still pretty\npoor really \u2013 although it was really nice seeing the devs for a chance, we\u2019re\nalways hidden from the final product.\n\nCongratulations! Everybody here at DMA Design salutes you as a MASTER Lemmings\nplayer. Not many people will complete the Mayhem levels, you are definitely\none of the elite\n\nNow prepare to receive rapturous applause from all here.\n\nLemmings End Screen\n\nThe number of people that claim to have been involved in the original\nLemmings, is huge. The actual number isn\u2019t.\n\nThe main folk were Dave Jones (Amiga), Russell Kay (PC), Gary Timmons\n(Animations), Scott Johnston(Backgrounds), Me (Mike Dailly), Brian Watson(ST),\nBrian Johnson (Music+SFX) and Steve Hammond (PC EGA/CGA Graphics conversion),\nJon Dye (Spectrum version and Amiga/PC work). Adrian Powell did the box cover\nart, Tim Write (Amiga music), Tony Williams (PC Music), oh and Carol Johnston\n(Scott\u2019s Mum, who did the original Lemmings Voice!)\n\nIf I\u2019ve missed anyone and you think you know some one else who should be on\nthis list, then please let me know \u2013 but I reserve the right to laugh at you.\n\nThis list obviously doesn\u2019t include any Psygnosis staff, since during the\nfirst lemmings game, they only really gave feedback, and tested \u2013 although\nJohn Whyte\u2019s level feedback was excellent. He used to draw up a lovely grid\nwith level names and then rated them and gave some comments back. I also\nhaven\u2019t included Geoff Gunning, as although he did the logo, it wasn\u2019t\nspecifically for Lemmings, and he never actually touch a computer doing it...\nGeoff would however end up doing a lot of Lemmings work with Visual Sciences\nin years to come!\n\nAnd so there we have it \u2013 the full story of Lemmings. I\u2019m sure that this will\nbe added to as the others read it and remember little stories of their own, or\ncorrect some small points listed here, but this is pretty close.\n\nHope you enjoyed it!\n\nHere are some more Lemmings images....\n\nMy Lemmings Editor DiskMy initials in the End ScreenThe Lemmings LogoThe\nscrolly messageGoing Up!A WalkerSplash screen used on the EditorThe last level\n\u2013 Rendezvous At The MountainCGA, EGA and VGA graphicsMy Lemming image used for\nthe Well Done screenEnd Screen Recreation\n\n(c) Copyright Mike Dailly 2006 By Mike Dailly.
