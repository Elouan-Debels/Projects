In addition to cycle paths, new concepts\nare required if an increasing number of bicycles in urban areas are to be\naccommodated compactly and safely.\n\nTogether with the Zurich start-up v-locker, we developed an automated parking\nsystem. This couples simple technology with demanding design and smart\nmobility solutions.\n\nThe intuitive handling is done by using a smartphone app. This app displays\nthe nearest station with free parking spaces, reserves a box and opens the\naccess door.\n\nThe modular towers fit into the local environment optimally by means of\nindividual facade design. With this project we make our contribution to\nattractive town planning and support a sustainable traffic transition.\n\n#### Customer\n\n  * v-locker\n\n#### Sector\n\n  * Smart City & Mobility Solutions\n\n#### Services\n\n  * Design Research\n  * Concept Design\n  * Customer Journey\n  * Industrial Design\n  * App Design\n  * Logo Design\n  * Visualisation\n\n#### Awards\n\nGerman Ecodesign Award Nominee 2022\n\nv-locker.ch\n\n### More Projects.\n\nvisit Projects\n\n### Launch your project\n\nproject@meyer-hayoz.com\n\nMeyer-Hayoz Design Engineering AG Technoparkstrasse 2 8406 Winterthur Schweiz\n+41 52 209 01 01 info.ch@meyer-hayoz.com\n\nMeyer-Hayoz Design Engineering GmbH Salmannsweilergasse 36 78462 Konstanz\nDeutschland +49 7531 90 93 0 info.de@meyer-hayoz.com\n\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Vimeo\n  * Instagram\n\n", "frontpage": false}
