Simpson murder trial 20 years ago changed the media landscape\n\nBy Kent Babb\n\nJune 9, 2014 at 6:23 p.m. EDT\n\nThe O.J. Simpson trial, in 60 seconds\n\n1:00\n\nO.J. Simpson was found not guilty of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and\nRonald Goldman in 1995. The investigation and trial lasted more than a year\nand included a number of memorable moments. Here are a few of them, starting\nwith O.J.'s infamous car chase which took place June 17, 1994. (Video: The\nWashington Post)\n\nShare\n\nComment0\n\nSave\n\nThe cameras came on, and America stopped to watch. O.J. Simpson was in the\nback of a white Ford Bronco, former college and National Football League\nteammate Al Cowlings behind the wheel, and police cars were trailing slowly\nbehind. Around 95 million viewers tuned in, reality playing out on jostling\nhelicopter cameras, on handmade signs draped onto overpasses of Los Angeles\nfreeways, Friday night programming interrupted on televisions across America.\n\n\u201cWhite, black, immigrants who were from different races, women and men, rich\nand poor \u2014 and everyone was glued to the television,\u201d said Charles Ogletree, a\nprofessor at Harvard Law School who directs the school\u2019s Institute for Race\nand Justice.\n\nTwenty years ago this Thursday, Simpson\u2019s ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and a\nfriend, Ronald Goldman, were found stabbed to death in the Brentwood area of\nLos Angeles. Simpson, a famous actor, running back and Heisman Trophy winner\nwho was one of the most recognizable personalities in the country, was\nimplicated in the killings and would soon be charged with double murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhat came next \u2014 the slow-speed white Bronco chase, round-the-clock television\ncoverage, a riveting trial and not-guilty verdict that split the country along\nracial lines \u2014 offered the United States a gateway drug its residents\neventually couldn\u2019t live without.\n\n\u201cWhat I realized is, this is entertainment,\u201d said Gerald Uelmen, one of\nSimpson\u2019s defense attorneys. \u201cThis is not news.\u201d\n\nO.J. Simpson criminal trial timeline\n\n+12\n\nThe \u201ctrial of the century\u201d captivated the nation as the former football star\nwas accused of murdering his ex-wife and her friend.\n\nIn the years since, the lineage of so many cultural phenomena \u2014 the 24-hour\nnews cycle, a never-ending stream of reality television shows and many\nAmericans\u2019 unquenchable thirst for celebrity gossip \u2014 can be traced to this\nnearly 16-month span.\n\nBefore the killings on June 12, 1994, CNN was 14 years old and had a foothold\nin households but wasn\u2019t yet appointment viewing; Court TV was a startup\nnetwork with a niche of drawing legal die-hards into courtrooms. Fox News and\nMSNBC were two years from their cable debuts. Prime-time programming in those\ndays consisted of scripted entertainment; no one then could imagine that, two\ndecades into the future, televising the trivialities of daily life would\ncaptivate the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSimpson was one of the most marketable ex-athletes in the country. One of the\ngreatest running backs of all time, Simpson built a successful post-playing\ndays career as an actor and a pitchman. He was an African American who\ntranscended race and became known for his upbeat, everyman smile as he jogged\nthrough the airport, leaping over suitcases in Hertz rental car commercials.\n\nBut soon after the killings, the landscape began changing. Players in the\nSimpson drama, large and small, quickly became international celebrities,\nmillions glued themselves to televisions for the case\u2019s next twist, and TV\nproducers and sports agents began preparing for a country whose trust in the\ncriminal justice system and professional athletes had taken a direct hit. As\nfor Simpson, he would be acquitted in October 1995, a verdict that split the\nnation, before losing a civil jury trial that ordered him to pay $33.5 million\nto the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman, who were both white.\nSimpson, now 66, is currently serving prison time on a 2008 armed robbery\nconviction.\n\n\u201cIt made a lot of things look pretty rotten, made things look pretty raw,\u201d\nsaid Greta Van Susteren, a former adjunct law professor at Georgetown\nUniversity who became a star for her legal analysis on CNN during the Simpson\nproceedings and now hosts a nightly show on Fox News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut amid all the grime, if the proliferation of reality shows, the\ntabloidization of the media and the insatiable appetite for celebrity news can\nbe called that, some good was done, too. Inspired by the use of DNA evidence\nduring the Simpson trial, more than 300 wrongfully convicted inmates rode the\nrelatively new science to freedom.\n\n\u201cThere will never be another case that has the combination of circumstances,\nfacts and timing that allowed this case to explode,\u201d television commentator\nDan Abrams said.\n\n###\n\nA different landscape\n\nAbrams was 28 when the assignment came: Get to Los Angeles to cover the\nSimpson case.\n\nHe was the junior correspondent for Court TV, and he drew the job only because\nthe network\u2019s two other field reporters were busy. A few months later, before\nthe trial began, he opened People magazine to read that he was listed among\nthe \u201cWho\u2019s who\u201d in the Simpson case, alongside prosecutor Marcia Clark, judge\nLance Ito and Brian \u201cKato\u201d Kaelin, a little-known actor who lived on the\nSimpson property and became a prosecution witness and media darling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cAs more and more people were watching,\u201d said Abrams, now a co-anchor on ABC\u2019s\n\u201cNightline,\u201d \u201cit became clear this was different.\u201d\n\nCourt TV and CNN had made the bold decision to cover every turn of the case,\nno matter how meaningless. Back then, this was revolutionary and maybe even a\nlittle risky; never had one news event been covered so continually. But rather\nthan recoil, TV viewers barely noticed they were ignoring their soap operas\nand prime-time dramas because this one beat them all. Here was a celebrity on\ntrial for murder \u2014 with race and sex providing colorful sidebars \u2014 with a cast\nof newly familiar faces as its central characters. Suddenly the decision to\ncarry the case around the clock seemed brilliant; in the days before live\nstreams, constantly updated Web sites and social media, the two channels were\nfeeding a national hunger.\n\nThe Simpson case was a \u201charbinger of an entirely different media landscape \u2014\nan event that preoccupies everyone full-time for months on end,\u201d said Mark\nCrispin Miller, a professor at New York University who studies media and\nculture. \u201cYou have to become gradually acclimated to this kind of spectacle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAfter the Simpson verdict, when public interest in trial coverage eventually\nweakened, Court TV rebranded itself in 2008 as TruTV, which broadcasts\nsomething called \u201cactuality\u201d television. The major broadcast and cable\nnetworks, meanwhile, turned to unscripted contest shows and programs featuring\nthe adventures of families with 17 or more children, friends living together\nalong the New Jersey coast, and the mostly bearded family of a duck-call\ncompany in Louisiana.\n\n\u201cFifty years ago, what you would\u2019ve turned away from as outrageous, you turn\nto as kind of normal and interesting,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd then you can\u2019t do\nwithout it.\u201d\n\n###\n\nA lasting impact\n\nAfter Simpson\u2019s criminal case closed, many key players in the drama moved on\nto even bigger stardom. A few, including Uelmen and Clark, wrote books. Van\nSusteren began co-hosting a nightly legal analysis program. Harvey Levin, who\nhad covered the trial for a Los Angeles news station, appeared on reality\nshows and eventually founded the celebrity Web site TMZ.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSports agent Leigh Steinberg, who represented many of the 1990s\u2019 biggest\nnames, adjusted his marketing strategy to convince companies that Simpson was\nan aberration; that an endorsement from a famous athlete was still solid. But\neven Steinberg couldn\u2019t sell a client with a history of domestic violence.\n\u201cAdvertisers were not looking for players who reminded them of the Simpson\nsituation,\u201d Steinberg said.\n\nTrust in athletes took years to rebuild, Steinberg said, and even now, major\nincidents such as those involving football players Michael Vick and Aaron\nHernandez in recent years are setbacks. Athletes are now more closely vetted\nby sponsors and their own teams.\n\n\u201cIn the viewers\u2019 mind\u2019s eye, this was not an isolated event,\u201d Steinberg said\nof the Simpson case. \u201cOne event has the psychological impact of a thousand\nevents.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe case, and in particular the not-guilty verdict, also fanned leftover\nracial tension from the 1991 police beating of Rodney King, which triggered\nrace riots in Los Angeles. Race had been a key topic during the trial \u2014 a\nblack defendant, two white victims, Los Angeles detective Mark Fuhrman\u2019s use\nof a racial slur (a revelation Simpson\u2019s lawyers used to question his\nmotives), even the jury\u2019s racial diversity (nine blacks, two whites and a\nHispanic).\n\nIts conclusion quieted little of the talk that America remained divided;\nopinions on the case and verdict traveled racial lines, and two decades later,\nthey often still do.\n\n\u201cWhen you ask people today, African Americans will overwhelmingly say that,\nnot that he\u2019s not guilty, but the government didn\u2019t prove that he was guilty,\u201d\nsaid Ogletree, the Harvard law professor. \u201cWhite people will say that he\nkilled two white people and got away with it.\u201d\n\n###\n\nUse of DNA evidence\n\nSome who followed the case were watching for more than just entertainment. The\nproceedings were shown on televisions in prison day rooms and inside cells,\nwhere hundreds saw an opportunity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTwo members of Simpson\u2019s defense team, Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, had\nearlier founded the Innocence Project, a nonprofit that assigned law students\nto use DNA evidence to free wrongfully convicted inmates. Before the trial,\nthis relatively new science was seen as confusing and expensive; the Simpson\ntrial demonstrated it could be available to everyone.\n\n\u201cDNA was so complex and complicated that nobody really asked for it,\u201d Van\nSusteren said. \u201cThey might find some man or woman, usually man, sitting in\nsome country jail someplace in the middle of some state, and all of a sudden\nafter watching O.J. Simpson \u2014 because the world did \u2014 he asks for a DNA test.\u201d\n\nOne of those was Marvin Anderson, who at age 18 was convicted of a rape he\ndidn\u2019t commit. After a decade in prison and letters to politicians and talk-\nshow hosts, a counselor suggested he contact Scheck and Neufeld. At that time,\nAnderson was one of a handful to pursue exoneration through DNA evidence.\nAfter the Simpson coverage, the entire country \u2014 along with its falsely\naccused and wrongfully convicted \u2014 knew of this new frontier.\n\n\u201cThe O.J. Simpson trial made the world know about DNA,\u201d said Anderson, now a\n50-year-old volunteer firehouse captain in Hanover, Va. He was exonerated in\n2002, two decades after the rape victim incorrectly identified him in a police\nlineup.\n\nIn total, the Innocence Project has helped to overturn 316 convictions,\nincluding some that led to death sentences. Without the awareness generated by\nthe Simpson case, Van Susteren said, some might still be sitting in prisons or\nawaiting for their final punishments.\n\n\u201cI know there are a lot of warts and scars and everything else about what\npeople say about the O.J. Simpson trial,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that everybody\nknew about DNA is huge to our criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nD.C. region\n\nLocal news, weather, sports, events, restaurants and more\n\nDavid Chang\u2019s Momofuku draws heat over its \u2018chile crunch\u2019 trademark\n\nThe Nationals were patient at the plate against Blake Snell.
