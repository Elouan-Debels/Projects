How does RUBYCARP Operate? RUBYCARP\u2019s\nMotivations Conclusion\n\nContent\n\n  * Attribution\n  * What is RUBYCARP?\n  * How does RUBYCARP Operate?\n  * RUBYCARP\u2019s Motivations\n  * Conclusion\n\nThe Sysdig Threat Research Team (Sysdig TRT) recently discovered a long-\nrunning botnet operated by a Romanian threat actor group, which we are calling\nRUBYCARP. Evidence suggests that this threat actor has been active for at\nleast 10 years. Its primary method of operation leverages a botnet deployed\nusing a variety of public exploits and brute force attacks. This group\ncommunicates via public and private IRC networks, develops cyber weapons and\ntargeting data, and uses its botnet for financial gain via cryptomining and\nphishing. This report explores how RUBYCARP operates and its motivations.\n\nRUBYCARP, like many threat actors, is interested in payloads that enable\nfinancial gain. This includes cryptomining, DDoS, and Phishing. We have seen\nit deploy a number of different tools to monetize its compromised assets. For\nexample, through its Phishing operations, RUBYCARP has been seen targeting\ncredit cards. As we have seen with other threat actors, it has a diversified\nset of illicit income streams.\n\n## Attribution\n\nRUBYCARP, the name we have given this group, is a financially-motivated threat\nactor group that is most likely Romanian. RUBYCARP may be related to the\nOutlaw advanced persistent threat (APT), as it does share many of the same\ntactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). However, since these shared TTPs\nare common across many botnet operators, we cannot definitively make this\nconclusion. RUBYCARP leverages Shellbot often during its operations, which can\nalso cause attribution confusion since this tool is a common choice among\nthreat actors.\n\nIn the murky world of cybercriminal threat intelligence, there is often a lot\nof crossover in both tools and targeting. In the recent advisory from CISA,\nthe Androxgh0st threat actor\u2019s choice to exploit Laravel is discussed. This is\nanother example of cybercriminal overlap, with RUBYCARP notably targeting the\nsame framework vulnerabilities. Many of these threat actors are fighting it\nout over the same target space, making it difficult to attribute attacks.\n\n## What is RUBYCARP?\n\nFor months, Sysdig TRT\u2019s has been tracking RUBYCARP through the targeting and\nexploitation of Laravel applications vulnerable to CVE-2021-3129. This led to\nevidence of SSH Brute forcing as another way the group gained access to its\ntargets. Recently, we also discovered evidence of the threat actor targeting\nWordPress sites using dumps of usernames and passwords. RUBYCARP continues to\nadd new exploitation techniques to its arsenal in order to build its botnets.\n\nOnce access is obtained, a backdoor is installed based on the popular Perl\nShellbot. The victim\u2019s server is then connected to an IRC server acting as\ncommand and control, and joins the larger botnet. During RUBYCARP\u2019s\nreconnaissance phase, we found 39 variants of the Perl file (shellbot), but\nonly eight were in VirusTotal. This means that only a few campaigns were\npreviously detected. The modifications of the files are:\n\n  * A nickname is used to join the IRC server\n  * The channel where the victim joins is often marked by either a platform name (e.g., apache) or a member name (e.g., juice)\n  * Sometimes auth is added\n  * The IRC server\n\n### Campaigns\n\nAfter connecting to the IRC server, we discovered the actual number of\ncompromised hosts at over 600. On the other hand, by not properly configuring\nthe connection to the server, RUBYCARP has a detection system to kick out\nunexpected/unwanted users of the server and ban their IP to prevent new\nconnections. It tries to keep the network hidden as much as possible.\n\nThe last active domain of this botnet is chat[.]juicessh[.]pro, and we were\nable to obtain the information below:\n\n  * It was created on Monday, May 1, 2023 at 04:30:05 UTC\n  * 624 nicks [2 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 622 normal]\n  * VICTIMS by channel at the moment of writing:\n\n    * #juscan1, 176 victims\n    * #cfs, 11 victims\n    * #php3, 34 victims\n    * #sb, 33 victims\n\nBased on naming schemes and connection configuration, the apparent group would\nbe composed of users like \u201cjuice,\u201d \u201ccartier,\u201d or \u201caridan,\u201d but there could be\nmore, where each one might be dedicated to a purpose, cryptomining, customized\ntools, etc. During our investigation, we determined that its IRC server of\nchoice for public and private hosting is undernet.org. The active private IRC\nnetworks are chat[.]juicessh[.]pro and sshd[.]run.\n\nThe infrastructure we discovered for RUBYCARP is comprised of a significant\nnumber of malicious IPs and domains, rotated regularly and often replaced and\nemptied of its malicious content as soon as any potential research activity\nwas detected. A full infrastructure list is available here.\n\n## How does RUBYCARP Operate?\n\nRUBYCARP uses multiple IRC networks for general communications, but also to\nmanage its botnets and coordinate cryptomining campaigns. An outline of its\norganization when managing botnets would be as follows:\n\nIn one of the logs we acquired, RUBYCARP tends to share the tools it is using,\nwhich include many of the tools we have been able to collect through our\nhoneypot, such as:\n\n  * Banner\n  * Masscan\n  * X (kernel module)\n  * brute\n\n### Communications\n\n#### Private IRC\n\nFor managing its botnet, RUBYCARP uses a collection of private IRC servers and\nseems to rotate them regularly. \u201cJuice.baselinux.net,\u201d \u201cchat.juicessh.pro,\u201d\nand others are the latest active ones at the time of writing. Each RUBYCARP\ncampaign gets its own IRC channel and the bots within each channel are then\nnamed according to a predefined scheme. We were able to map the observed\nservers and their respective channels, although, unfortunately, not all of\nthem are still active or accessible.\n\n#### Public IRC\n\n##### Members\n\nMembers of RUBYCARP mainly communicate through an Undernet IRC channel called\n#Cristi. Public logs for the channel show a user (and admin) \u201c_juice\u201d\ninteracting with other members of the group in Romanian; we can also see that\nthe channel topic is related to previous or current campaigns, available\nbelow.\n\nWhile we monitored the chats, both actors, juice and Eugen, who own the\nchannel #Eugen from which we collected most of the mining setup evidence, were\npresent in channel #Cristi.\n\nWithin the user base of the channel #Cristi, which at the time of writing\ncontained 280 users, we identified multiple familiar names of actors who\nattacked our honeypot. For example, \u201cCatalin\u201d attacked our honeypot on Jan. 8,\n2024 from IP 80[.]83[.]124[.]150. The following image is of the website hosted\nthere at the time of the attack. Notice the attribution to \u201cCatalin\u201d at the\nbottom.\n\nAnother one is \u201caridan,\u201d who we observed in previous attacks with the domain\n\u201caridan.men.\u201d\n\nThe most recurring IRC admins we found within the Shellbot configuration files\nare \u201cjuice,\u201d \u201cMUIE,\u201d and \u201cSmecher,\u201d who also each have their own respective\nchannels for malicious operations. \u201cjuice\u201d has been the most prolific in\nsetting up new malicious Shellbot configurations, new servers, and new victim\nchannels. Below is the WHOIS screenshot for the #Cristi channel members we\u2019ve\nidentified:\n\njuice_, admin\n\nSmecher, admin\n\nMUIE, admin\n\nAridan, member\n\nCatalin, member\n\nDog, developer\n\n#### Community\n\nWe identified a custom script that is plausibly circulated among the group\nmembers on how to set up the juice mining operation. It then lists the #redhat\nchannel hosted on undernet for support. This channel has no official relation\nto RedHat the business or software, and is likely just a nod to redhat\nvigilante hacking.\n\nThe redhat channel uses the undernet IRC network. Specifically, this group\nuses the Romanian server bucharest.ro.eu.undernet[.]org, where the username\n@juice_ is present.\n\nThe channel #Cristi is used to set up mining operations and keeps track of the\nmembers utilizing the custom malicious tools we encountered, often signed by\n\u201cJuice\u201d and \u201cCartier\u201d (aka \u201cdog\u201d and \u201cKartier\u201d) group members.\n\nWithin the channel #Cristi logs we were able to scrape, we found a reference\nto an external link http://physics.uctm.edu/funis/eugen. To our surprise, it\ncontained quite an extensive record of logs taken from the private channel\n#Eugen, which we had not seen before.\n\nBy investigating what we had found, we quickly discovered that the two people\ninvolved in most of the interactions within these logs were user \u201cKartier\u201d\n(signed as \u201cdog\u201d) and \u201cEugen.\u201d Both members were present, at different times,\nin the channel #Cristi. \u201cEugen\u201d seems to be a moniker for a Romanian\nindividual who also conducts malicious operations alongside the other members,\nas the logs containing their own miner setups attest.\n\nLink to the #Eugen channel logs found in #Cristi\n\nThe main domain where these logs are currently saved belongs to a legitimate\nBulgarian University, the University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy.\nThe subdomain physics.uctm[.]edu appears to be compromised by RUBYCARP and\ncontains detailed instructions and information on the tools used and the miner\nconfiguration.\n\nWe\u2019ve identified the user \u201cdog\u201d as the main malicious tool developer of the\ngroup, signing their tools with \u201cCartier\u201d and \u201cKartier.\u201d We have also found\ndirect evidence of tool developer, \u201cCartier,\u201d within the channel #Cristi, as\nshown below.\n\nDog\u2019s tool expertise is reflected in the way it instructs other members of the\ngroup how to set up and run the custom malicious tools. These malicious tools\nhave been found in almost all of the campaigns we were targeted in. This list\nincludes:\n\nHere, user \u201cEugen\u201d shows running miners, bash, and ld-linux-x8:\n\nThere is also a reference to malicious ELF \u201cplm,\u201d observed multiple times in\nattacks against our honeypot and also reported in past campaigns:\n\nBelow, there is an excerpt of how user \u201cdog\u201d is attempting to give access to\nuser \u201cEugen\u201d to a malicious domain containing a setup script for its\ninfrastructure.\n\nThe IP above corresponds to a malicious indicator on VirusTotal, identified as\nmalware.\n\nThere are also references to RUBYCARP\u2019s most commonly used tool, Mass Scanner\n(masscan), a tool omnipresent within its pre-exploitation activities and\nutilized to find new potential victims.\n\n## RUBYCARP\u2019s Motivations\n\n### Cryptomining\n\nRUBYCARP uses its own pools for mining that are hosted on the same domains\nwhere it has created the IRC server to control the bots. These custom mining\npools allow it to avoid detection from IP-based blocklists, and the usage of\ncommon and random ports provides another layer of stealth from simple\ndetection systems. We\u2019ve also discovered that it has not focused on a single\ncryptocurrency or mining tool but, instead, has several miners and wallets\nwith activity. All the following IoCs are related to the \u201cjuice\u201d threat actor.\n\nMining Pools:\n\n  * juicessh[.]space:443\n  * juicessh[.]space:4430\n  * juicessh[.]space:5332\n  * 91[.]208.206.118:443\n  * 194[.]163.141.243:4430\n  * sshd[.]baselinux[.]net\n  * run[.]psybnc[.]org:443\n\nKnown miners\n\n  * NanoMiner\n  * XMrig\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\n  * Monero\n  * Ethereum\n  * Ravencoin\n\nThe Ravencoin wallet has been particularly prolific. From a wallet checker,\nits total amount in USD would be over $22,800 received. The wallet has a large\nnumber of transactions associated with it and has been active since February\n2022, and the last available transaction was mined on March 12, 2024.\n\nThere are also several exchanges of wallet information among the members, in\nan attempt to show how much they have gained from these malicious campaigns.\nIn the excerpt below, user \u201cporno\u201d claimed to have gained 0.00514903 BTC,\naround $360 USD, within 24 hours.\n\n### C3Bash\n\nOn top of the already known miners we observed above, we also encountered a\ncustom command-line miner set up called simply \u201cminer,\u201d which we named\n\u201cC3Bash\u201d due to the self-labeling we found. The script in question is signed\nby \u201cJuice\u201d and it allows a potential user to set up its wallet address with a\ncommand line argument, as well as any miner of choice.\n\nOnce the user has set up its configurations, the script takes care of\ndownloading, installing, and running the miners in the background, also\nalerting the user if the script gets killed by an antivirus or simply removed.\nIt also suggests what the CPU usage should be compared to the host, probably\nto avoid detection. On a victim device, this may result in the running of\nmultiple miners at the same time, effectively reducing both the time it takes\nfor the attacker to execute the malicious payload and the chances of it being\ndetected, as the execution will now rely on a single script.\n\nThe script at the moment supports miners XMRig/Monero, and the script itself\nwas hosted on a now-dead domain \u201cdownload[.]c3bash[.]org.\u201d\n\n### Phishing\n\nWe found evidence that RUBYCARP also executes phishing operations to steal\nfinancially valuable assets, such as credit card numbers. Based on logs, it\nappears that it is using this to fund its infrastructure but it is reasonable\nto think RUBYCARP also uses these for other purposes, or possibly to sell.\n\nIn one of the attacks we received against our honeypot in December 2023, we\nidentified a phishing template (letter.html) targeting Danish users and\nimpersonating the Danish logistics company \u201cBring.\u201d\n\nWe also discovered a PHP script, named \u201cini.inc,\u201d used to send those phishing\nemails. An email.txt file was found that contained two potential compromised\nemail accounts from which the attackers would send emails:\n\u201ctest@lufaros[.]com\u201d and \u201cmaria@cenacop[.]com.\u201d At the time of this writing,\nthe domain \u201clufaros[.]com\u201d is marked as Malicious on VirusTotal.\n\nAnalyzing the shellbot code shows that it has specific commands to send\nemails, and it is likely that this is the template used in the campaigns:\n\nsendraw($IRC_cur_socket, \"PRIVMSG $printl :!u sendmail <subject> <sender>\n<recipient> <message>\");\n\nWe identified 36 text files containing hundreds of Danish email addresses,\nsome of which were present in both old and recent data leaks. It is reasonable\nto think that the email addresses may have been the target of the phishing\ntemplate shown above.\n\nWithin the same data, we also identified a Zip file named \u201cremote_code.zip.\u201d\nOnce extracted, the archive contains a logo image of the European bank Nets.\nWithin the same folder, there are also SVG files containing an \u201cID Check\u201d\nverification image and a Visa logo. More images were also found containing a\nmobile phone layout, as shown below, effectively emulating a Nets home banking\napplication. These would be used to build a convincing phishing landing page.\n\nArchivesArchive content\n\nFinally, we also found direct evidence of a new domain purchase. In an excerpt\nbelow, it is possible to see how the user \u201cdog\u201d/\u201dcartier\u201d is preparing to\npurchase a new potential domain with stolen credit card data.\n\nThe screenshot above shows a conversation where user \u201cdog\u201d lists files which\nwe believe it has stolen. The filenames seem a clear reference to Swedish bank\nSwish, and the timestamp in the filenames suggests they may have been stolen\nin 2016. \u201cDog\u201d also provided credit card information to be used, presumably,\nby other members. These were printed in clear text within the channel, and\nhave been redacted as they contained payment information.\n\nGiven the evidence above, it is plausible that the attackers may rely on\nphishing templates to collect payment information. It is safe to assume the\nphishing targets European entities, such as Swish Bank, Nets Bank, and Bring\nLogistics, among others.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRUBYCARP is a group of Romanian threat actors who have been active for almost\na decade. Attribution is always difficult, but they are most likely Romanian\nand may have some crossover with the \u201cOutlaw APT\u201d group and others who\nleverage the Perl Shellbot. These threat actors are also involved in the\ndevelopment and sale of cyber weapons, which isn\u2019t very common. They have a\nlarge arsenal of tools they have built up over the years which gives them\nquite a range of flexibility when conducting their operations.\n\nCommunications between threat actors hasn\u2019t changed very much over the years,\nwith IRC still being very popular. There is also a community aspect to\nRUBYCARP which is interesting, as they help mentor people who are new to the\nscene. This does provide some financial benefits to the group since it can\nthen sell them the toolset that it has made.\n\nWhile RUBYCARP targets known vulnerabilities and conducts brute force attacks,\nwhat makes it more dangerous is its post-exploitation tools and the breadth of\nits capabilities (i.e., Phishing). Defending against this group requires\ndiligent vulnerability management, a robust security posture, and runtime\nthreat detection.\n\nSubscribe and get the latest updates\n\nThank You For Signing Up!\n\nThis form failed to load.\n\nAn ad blocking extension or strict tracking protection is preventing this form\nfrom loading.
