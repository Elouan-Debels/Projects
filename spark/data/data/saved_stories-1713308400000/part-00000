The overall longevity of devices as\ncomplex as modern notebooks also depends on how long the software and firmware\ncontinues to be useful. That includes compatibility updates to support newer\ngenerations hardware modules, fixes for bugs or compatibility issues found by\nend users, and especially patches for security vulnerabilities. We recognize\nthat we have fallen short of where we need to be on software updates, and we\nare making the needed investments to resolve this.\n\nWe now have a dedicated team of engineers at our manufacturing partner and a\nset of internal stakeholders focused on ongoing software updates for all of\nour products, going back to our original Framework Laptop with 11th Gen Intel\nCore. In the past, we were reliant on ad-hoc availability of engineering time\nfrom our suppliers (basically borrowing staffing from whichever new product\ndevelopment we had ongoing). This was inconsistent and resulted in slow\nprogress. With a dedicated team, there is no longer resource contention, and\nwe are able deliver shorter turnaround times from discovering issues to\nresolving them.\n\nWe are rotating the team between each of our previously launched platforms\nbased on the updates we need to make, like security fixes from upstream\nsuppliers, community-reported bugs, and in some cases, new features and\nfunctionality. Our overall software release process for firmware and drivers\nis now as follows:\n\n  1. Identifying and prioritizing the issues and updates the sustaining engineering team will work on for a release for a specific platform.\n  2. A multi-week development and validation cycle.\n  3. Internal testing by additional Framework team members of a candidate release.\n  4. A Community Beta release, which we announce in the relevant sub-forum in the Community.\n  5. After a one to two week period of beta testing, if no substantial regressions are identified, public release onto our BIOS and Drivers download page.\n\nWe\u2019d love to provide a specific length of time we can commit to for ongoing\nBIOS updates for each generation, but we\u2019re dependent on the support lifetimes\nof our upstream silicon vendors who in some cases haven\u2019t shared public end of\nsupport dates. Instead, we can state that our intent is to provide security\nupdates for at least as long as our silicon vendors are able to. Note that\nthis specifically applies to the UEFI firmware and drivers that are provided\nto us as binaries. For the embedded controllers in our laptops and for\nFramework Laptop 16 Input Modules, our firmware is fully open source. This\nmeans we have full access to make updates as needed, and the broader community\ncan contribute as well. You can access the source for these on GitHub.\n\nIf you currently have a Framework Laptop, here\u2019s the latest firmware you can\npick up. We have updaters available for both Windows and Linux. We strongly\nrecommend always running the latest released BIOS and drivers, as there are\nboth security and bug fixes incorporated:\n\n  * Framework Laptop 13 (11th Gen Intel Core) - 3.19 is the latest release. We\u2019ll be doing a further release with additional security updates.\n  * Framework Laptop 13 (12th Gen Intel Core) - 3.08 is the latest release. This incorporates fixes for all known UEFI security issues, including LogoFAIL, and adds support for the 61Wh Battery. This is released for Windows, and for Linux we\u2019re developing a new updater to handle the specific firmware regions involved.\n  * Framework Laptop 13 (13th Gen Intel Core) - We\u2019re currently in development on a release that incorporates both bug fixes and security fixes.\n  * Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen 7040 Series) - 3.05 is the latest release, which we published earlier this week. This includes fixes for LogoFAIL along with assorted bug fixes. You can also pick up our latest driver bundle from that page.\n  * Framework Laptop 16 (AMD Ryzen 7040 Series) - 3.03 is the latest release, which we also published earlier this week. You can pick up the driver bundle there too.\n\nWith each of these complete, we've resolved both infrastructure and process\nissues that now make it faster for us to iterate on BIOS and driver updates on\neach platform. Obviously, our words here are not enough. We need to and commit\nto demonstrating this by actually improving both our iteration speed on\nsoftware updates and our communication processes around them. We\u2019re also\ncontinuing to grow our team\u2019s capabilities to support our products and\ncustomers. We currently have several team members we\u2019re actively recruiting\nfor who will join this effort:\n\n  * A Firmware/Software Engineer, bringing additional skills and adding bandwidth to the team.\n  * An Escalations Support Specialist, handling technical customer support escalations and bringing field issues to our engineering team.\n  * An Engineering Technician, adding validation and regression testing capabilities to the team.\n\nFinally, we have one last, completely unrelated update to share today: our\nproducts are now available for shipment to Poland. We had originally planned\nto share this today as part of a different newsletter topic, but rather than\nmaking our Polish customers wait, we\u2019re launching on schedule. We have a\nbigger update that we\u2019re looking forward to sharing with all of you next week.\n\nComment on this blog post in the Framework Community\n\nJoin the Discussion\n\n## Which Framework Laptop is right for you?\n\nBrowse Framework Laptops\n\n  * Company\n  * About Us\n  * Sustainability\n  * Our Blog\n  * We're Hiring 8\n  * Contact Us\n  * Framework for Business\n\n  * Social\n  * Twitter\n  * YouTube\n  * Instagram\n  * Facebook\n  * LinkedIn\n  * Discord\n  * Mastodon\n  * GitHub\n  * RSS\n\n  * Community\n  * Community Forum\n  * Support\n  * Repair Guides\n\n  * Marketplace\n  * View All\n  * Framework Laptop\n  * Expansion Cards\n  * Mainboards\n  * Memory & Storage\n  * Keyboards\n  * Parts\n  * Customization\n  * Tools\n  * Software\n  * Merch\n\nSubscribe\n\nStay up to date with the Framework Newsletter (a few times a month)\n\n\u00a9 2024 Framework Computer Inc\n\nTerms of Service\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWarranty\n\nTerms of Sale\n\nCookie Policy\n\nUSD\n\nUSD\n\n", "frontpage": false}
