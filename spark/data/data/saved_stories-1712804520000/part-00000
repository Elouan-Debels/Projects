This year, it\u2019s transitioning to a voltage\ntransformer supply. In a year or two, it\u2019s just electricity supply.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that Musk's crystal ball is free of cracks.\nGrady Booch, a frequent critic of AI hype on social media who is perhaps best\nknown for his work in software architecture, told Ars in an interview, \"Keep\nin mind that Mr. Musk has a profoundly bad record at predicting anything\nassociated with AI; back in 2016, he promised his cars would ship with FSD\nsafety level 5, and here we are, closing on an a decade later, still waiting.\"\n\nCreating artificial intelligence at least as smart as a human (frequently\ncalled \"AGI\" for artificial general intelligence) is often seen as inevitable\namong AI proponents, but there's no broad consensus on exactly when that\nmilestone will be reached\u2014or on the exact definition of AGI, for that matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you define AGI as smarter than the smartest human, I think it's probably\nnext year, within two years,\" Musk added in the interview with Tangen while\ndiscussing AGI timelines.\n\nEven with uncertainties about AGI, that hasn't kept companies from trying.\nChatGPT creator OpenAI, which launched with Musk as a co-founder in 2015,\nlists developing AGI as its main goal. Musk has not been directly associated\nwith OpenAI for years (unless you count a recent lawsuit against the company),\nbut last year, he took aim at the business of large language models by forming\na new company called xAI. Its main product, Grok, functions similarly to\nChatGPT and is integrated into the X social media platform.\n\nBooch gives credit to Musk's business successes but casts doubt on his\nforecasting ability. \"Albeit a brilliant if not rapacious businessman, Mr.\nMusk vastly overestimates both the history as well as the present of AI while\nsimultaneously diminishing the exquisite uniqueness of human intelligence,\"\nsays Booch. \"So in short, his prediction is\u2014to put it in scientific\nterms\u2014batshit crazy.\"\n\n### Further Reading\n\nElon Musk\u2019s new AI model doesn\u2019t shy from questions about cocaine and orgies\n\nSo when will we get AI that's smarter than a human? Booch says there's no real\nway to know at the moment. \"I reject the framing of any question that asks\nwhen AI will surpass humans in intelligence because it is a question filled\nwith ambiguous terms and considerable emotional and historic baggage,\" he\nsays. \"We are a long, long way from understanding the design that would lead\nus there.\"\n\nWe also asked Hugging Face AI researcher Dr. Margaret Mitchell to weigh in on\nMusk's prediction. \"Intelligence ... is not a single value where you can make\nthese direct comparisons and have them mean something,\" she told us in an\ninterview. \"There will likely never be agreement on comparisons between human\nand machine intelligence.\"\n\nBut even with that uncertainty, she feels there is one aspect of AI she can\nmore reliably predict: \"I do agree that neural network models will reach a\npoint where men in positions of power and influence, particularly ones with\ninvestments in AI, will declare that AI is smarter than humans. By end of next\nyear, sure. That doesn't sound far off base to me.\"\n\n### Ars Video\n\n### How Lighting Design In The Callisto Protocol Elevates The Horror\n\n#### reader comments\n\n328\n\nBenj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars\nTechnica.
