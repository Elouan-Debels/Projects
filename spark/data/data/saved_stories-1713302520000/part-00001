That came amid a\nwave of other layoffs in the tech, media, and finance sectors.\n\nDonahoe\u2019s strong endorsement of coming into the office is the latest salvo in\nthe debate over the future of work. Many workers insist they\u2019re more\nproductive from home, while return-to-office mandates are have been almost\nuniversally reviled.\n\nStill, in-office days at America\u2019s major companies have grown from 1.1 days\nper week on average in 2021 to 3.4 days in 2023. That\u2019s despite a recent\nsurvey showing that managers actually want to work from home more than their\nworkers.\n\nBut a separate study earlier this month found that for the first time since\nthe pandemic began, more workers are saying they prefer hybrid work to working\ncompletely remote.\n\nMeanwhile, the fruits of Nike\u2019s product innovation will be on a high-profile\nstage this summer, when top athletes will showcase its shoes and apparel\nduring the summer Olympics in Paris. That comes as emerging rivals have made\ninroads in key markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done more to advance running than any brand in the world over the last\n50 years and we continue to lead with elite runners,\u201d Donahoe told CNBC when\nasked about On Running and Hoka. \u201cInnovation has always been what\u2019s marked\nNike in running, as in other categories, and so we\u2019re not just going to copy\nwhat other people do.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to CHRO Daily, our newsletter focusing on helping HR executive\nnavigate the changing needs of the workplace.
