April 11, 2024 1 p.m.\n\n## The Clinton Triangle temporary shelter opened last summer and has seen\nsuccess slowed by funding gaps.\n\nCharlene Brown and her dog, Charlie, sit in front of her sleeping pod at the\nClinton Triangle shelter in Southeast Portland, Feb. 27, 2024. Brown has lived\nat the shelter since July, and is eager to move into permanent housing.\n\nAlex Zielinski / OPB\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:\n\nBecome a Sponsor\n\nCharlene Brown has lived in a 10-by-10-foot shed in an industrial lot in\nSoutheast Portland for seven months. It\u2019s one of 160 pods that make up the\ncity-owned Clinton Triangle shelter on a piece of property nestled between the\nrailroad tracks and Southeast Powell Boulevard.\n\nIt\u2019s where Brown has made new friends, adopted a dog named Charlie, and\ndaydreamed about moving into permanent housing after a decade on the streets.\n\nIt\u2019s also the same place where Brown nearly died.\n\nTwo months ago, Brown overdosed after taking meth that was laced with\nfentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid. Staff at the shelter had to use the\noverdose-reversing drug naloxone \u2014 often called by the brand name Narcan \u2014 on\nher six times.\n\n\u201cI felt like I just woke up from a nap,\u201d Brown recalled. \u201cI came to and, and\nam being told the words \u2018Narcan\u2019 and \u2018died\u2019 and I just remember crying,\nsaying, \u2018I don\u2019t understand.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrown has been sober ever since, and attends weekly recovery meetings off-\nsite. But it\u2019s not easy. The Clinton Triangle is a low-barrier shelter, which\nmeans people don\u2019t have to be sober to stay there. Guests aren\u2019t allowed to\ndrink or use drugs in public areas, but they do in the privacy of their pods.\n\nBrown said it\u2019s hard to remain sober at the shelter, as it seems to directly\ncontradict with her recovery process.\n\n\u201cThe first thing in treatment you learn is you gotta change your people,\nplaces and things,\u201d said Brown. \u201cBut it\u2019s a challenge, because I\u2019m living in,\nin the place where I OD-ed. I\u2019m freaking surrounded by the people that are\nusing [drugs], and I can\u2019t make them stop.\u201d\n\nBrown has been on a waiting list for a sober housing program since her\noverdose. But she still hasn\u2019t moved out of the shelter.\n\nLeaders at Clinton Triangle say that the key to their program\u2019s success is\noffering residents the help they need to better their lives when they\u2019re ready\nfor it. For people like Brown, that\u2019s a change of scenery. But those options\nare limited in Portland, where long-term funding for housing and addiction\ntreatment programs are hard to come by.\n\nAs the city moves to expand shelters like Clinton Triangle that reach people\nwho may be turned away from more traditional shelters, addiction experts\nbelieve it\u2019s important that they\u2019re matched with the housing and support\nneeded to truly leave homelessness behind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just waiting,\u201d said Brown. \u201cNervously waiting.\u201d\n\n### A new model\n\nThe origins and operations of the Clinton Triangle shelter have been baked in\ncontroversy. Plans for the shelter were first announced by Mayor Ted Wheeler\nin late 2022 in tandem with a polarizing plan to ban street camping citywide.\nWhile the camping ban was delayed by legal challenges, the shelter plan\nremained on track \u2014 but not without opposition. People experiencing\nhomelessness and advocates raised concerns about the scale of the shelters,\nwhich are far larger than any other city-run shelter. Wheeler eventually\noffered the hefty contract to a California-based organization called Urban\nAlchemy. The shelter opened in late July 2023.\n\nFILE - Portland politicians, with Mayor Ted Wheeler at the podium at a media\nevent in July 2023, preview the first large-scale alternative shelter at the\nClinton Triangle in Southeast Portland.\n\nAlex Zielinski / OPB\n\nSince its founding in 2018, Urban Alchemy has managed shelters and conducted\nstreet outreach in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Austin. It focuses on hiring\npeople who have lived experience with addiction, homelessness and\nincarceration. That resonates with some residents.\n\nTawshina Adams, a care coordinator at Urban Alchemy, is responsible for\nchecking in with 20 shelter residents regularly to make sure they are getting\nconnected to services they need. Adams was once homeless herself and said her\nbackground makes it easier for some residents to trust her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically how I am capable of doing my job,\u201d Adams said during an\ninterview at Clinton Triangle in late February. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to overwhelm\nguests. When they know that you\u2019ve been where they are, that really matters.\u201d\n\nRelated: Who is the California group bidding to operate homeless shelters in\nPortland?\n\nBut Urban Alchemy brought its own baggage to Portland. The nonprofit has been\nthe target of numerous lawsuits, alleging civil rights violations, physical\nand sexual harassment, and accusations of wage theft from staff. Urban Alchemy\nhas settled most of these lawsuits out of court. Most recently, two Urban\nAlchemy staff based in San Francisco accused their supervisor of sexual\nharassment. That supervisor was transferred to the Clinton Triangle in\nJanuary, following those complaints.\n\nKirkpatrick Tyler, Urban Alchemy\u2019s chief of community and government affairs,\nsaid that the nonprofit takes any allegations of misconduct against staff\n\u201cdevastatingly serious\u201d and investigates them thoroughly. The organization has\ndenied all accusations.\n\n### Reducing barriers, reducing harm\n\nThis shelter is not only unique for its size, but for what it allows. Many\nlocal shelters require sobriety, ban pets, prohibit couples from staying\ntogether, and have strict curfews. These rules can deter many people from\nseeking help. That\u2019s not the case at Clinton Triangle.\n\n\u201cWe tried to get rid of the stuff that kept people from coming inside,\u201d said\nAdams.\n\nClinton Triangle is considered a low-barrier shelter because guests can stay\nwith their pets and partners, and can come and go whenever they want. They\u2019re\nalso not expected to be sober while staying there. Residents say that most\nguests are using drugs inside their pods on a regular basis.\n\nA cluster of sleeping pods at the Clinton Triangle shelter on Feb. 27, 2024.\nThe shelter is the city's largest, offering space to more than 200 guests.\n\nAlex Zielinski / OPB\n\nShelter staff knock on guests\u2019 doors throughout the day to conduct wellness\nchecks, visits that have led to many overdose reversals. According to Portland\nFire and Rescue data, paramedics have been called to the shelter 24 times to\nrespond to overdoses between July 2023 and April 2024. Urban Alchemy says that\nno one has died from an overdose at the property.\n\nThis gives guests a sense of security that they never felt on the street.\n\n\u201cWe feel safe using here,\u201d said Kaleena, who moved into Clinton Triangle with\nher boyfriend in early March. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest things for us.\u201d\n\nKaleena and several other shelter residents who spoke with OPB declined to\nshare their last names out of privacy concerns. When Kaleena and her boyfriend\nlived out of a van in Southeast Portland, she said, they\u2019d frequently be\nharassed and threatened by people trying to steal drugs or money to buy drugs\n\u2014 or by people who appeared to be in a drug-induced psychosis. Urban Alchemy\nhas a no-tolerance policy for violence, meaning any violent guest will be\nimmediately evicted.\n\n\u201cThat changes everything,\u201d said Kaleena.\n\nIn many ways, Clinton Triangle could be considered a harm reduction model.\nHarm reduction is a term for programs that reduce the negative \u2014 and often\ndeadly \u2014 consequences associated with drug use.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept used to describe programs that distribute clean syringes or the\noverdose medication naloxone. It\u2019s also a term used for safe injection sites,\nfacilities where people can legally use hard drugs like fentanyl under the\nwatch of medical professionals who can reverse overdoses.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:\n\nBecome a Sponsor\n\nAvik Chatterjee is an addiction medicine physician at Boston University who\nfocuses on treating people experiencing homelessness. He said harm reduction\nis simply valuing the lives of people addicted to drugs over stigmatizing\ntheir addiction. It\u2019s also being able to swiftly offer people what they need \u2014\nwhether that\u2019s housing, treatment or other medical care \u2014 to help them move\npast addiction.\n\n\u201cIf you can keep people alive while they\u2019re going through whatever they\u2019re\ngoing through and help folks get onto the next thing in their life, that\u2019s\ncrucial,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s not dissimilar to the work being done by Urban Alchemy staff. But Tyler\nsaid they don\u2019t consider their work harm reduction. He instead characterized\nthe shelter as a \u201chealing space.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we get to call ourselves harm reduction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re\njust not othering and criminalizing people for challenges that they have and\nwe\u2019re not making them homeless because they\u2019re struggling in addiction.\n\n\u201cWe create spaces where people can safely work through their experience and\nhave a support system that can connect them to what\u2019s next, when they\u2019re ready\nfor what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nRelated: How fentanyl and social isolation have worsened youth homelessness in\nOregon\n\nAddiction experts agree that the Clinton Triangle falls short of offering true\nharm reduction, because of the inability of the program to always connect\npeople to that next step. Since January, the shelter has been unable to offer\nmost residents permanent housing. Space in local drug treatment facilities has\nbeen equally limited.\n\n\u201cIt is really key to have a good off-ramp,\u201d said Chatterjee. \u201cIf you set up\nthese programs and you don\u2019t have a way for folks to move into permanent\nsupportive housing, that is going to result in a problem.\u201d\n\nChatterjee said it\u2019s critical that people in low-barrier shelters are able to\nmove into housing or treatment after an overdose when they\u2019re ready. If that\noption isn\u2019t ready for them, those people could lose trust in the system,\npushing them further away from leaving homelessness behind.\n\n### Money problems\n\nThis has become the case for some at the Clinton Triangle.\n\nThe shelter was initially pitched as a temporary place for people moving from\nunsheltered homelessness into permanent housing. In October, the city was\ngranted $3.6 million from the state, funneled through Multnomah County, to\ncover up to a year\u2019s rent for people ready to move into their own place.\n\nThrough the rental program, administered by local homeless services nonprofit\nDo Good Multnomah, Portland has moved a little more than 100 people into\nhousing. But that money dried up in January. For nearly three months, most\nshelter residents seeking housing were told there was no money left to help\nthem.\n\n\u201cI feel left behind,\u201d said Maria, who moved into the Clinton Triangle the\nsecond day it was open. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be living like this forever.\u201d\n\nMaria, who uses a wheelchair due to knee pain, became homeless after fleeing\nan abusive relationship and used drugs to treat her mental and physical\nhealth. She asked OPB not to use her real name out of concern for her safety.\n\nSince moving into the shelter, Maria has dreamed of moving into permanent\nhousing, but she has been continuously told to wait until there\u2019s enough money\navailable. In the meantime, she\u2019s seen at least one close friend overdose. She\ndoesn\u2019t want to be next.\n\n\u201cI want to get clean someday,\u201d said Maria. \u201cI can\u2019t get clean here, there\u2019s no\nway. Drugs are everywhere.\u201d\n\nMichael Jones stands in a community room at his apartment complex in\nPortland's inner eastside, March 1, 2024. Jones moved from the Clinton\nTriangle shelter into a studio apartment in November, where his rent is paid\nfor an entire year.\n\nAlex Zielinski / OPB\n\nMichael Jones considers himself lucky. Jones was able to use state funding to\nmove into his own furnished studio apartment in Northeast Portland in\nNovember, before the money was used up. Since moving, he got a job as a cook\nand has been able to regularly attend alcohol recovery meetings and work on\nhis sobriety.\n\n\u201cI go to the meetings and I have three or four different mentors I talk to,\u201d\nJones said. \u201cEverybody says I\u2019m doing so good.\u201d\n\nHe said this would have been a lot harder to accomplish while living at a\nshelter, where he was surrounded by drug and alcohol use. But knowing he was\non the path toward stable housing helped make his time at Clinton Triangle\nmanageable.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I moved into my pod, they said, \u2018This is temporary. We\u2019re going to\nhelp you find housing and get into programs,\u2019\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd they did\nthat.\u201d\n\nBut the system that brought Jones success has been on pause for months at the\nClinton Triangle.\n\n### A short-term fix\n\nThere is some hope. After months of discussion, the city and Multnomah County\nreached a short-term funding plan last week. The county identified just over\n$1 million to cover a year\u2019s rent for 52 households at Clinton Triangle. That\nmoney comes from the supportive housing services measure, a regional tax meant\nto fund services that help keep people out of homelessness. While this tax has\nbeen unexpectedly flush with cash, the county has placed strict boundaries\naround what programs will be funded each year.\n\nThere\u2019s no plan for what happens when the funding to cover 52 housing\nplacements runs out.\n\nBoth the city and county pointed to their new joint plan to reduce unsheltered\nhomelessness in the metro region as a potential solution. That plan strives to\nmove nearly 3,000 people out of homelessness into shelter or permanent housing\nby the end of 2025 by investing in new shelter facilities, rent support, and\ndrug treatment programs. Both governments are still finalizing the details of\nthat strategy, which they say could establish a formal funding stream for\nhousing people as they leave shelters.\n\nAccording to county spokesperson Julia Comnes, Multnomah County Chair Jessica\nVega Pederson is looking into ways to fund this type of housing through the\ncounty budget for the next fiscal year, which begins in July.\n\nAll agree that a longer-term plan is critical for the longevity of the city\u2019s\nnew low-barrier shelter sites, especially as the region\u2019s unsheltered\npopulation continues to grow.\n\nThe Clinton Triangle is the first of six planned large-scale outdoor shelters,\ndubbed Temporary Alternative Shelter Sites, that Portland plans to open. The\ncity has no timeframe for opening the remaining five shelters, and has\nstruggled to locate property for future locations. But Mayor Wheeler is\nfocused on establishing the new shelters before he exits office at the end of\nthe year. In the interim, the city has begun to expand their smaller outdoor\nshelters, called Safe Rest Villages, with the Clinton Triangle shelter as a\nmodel.\n\nBrandy Westerman oversees the city\u2019s shelter programs, including the Clinton\nTriangle and Safe Rest Villages. She\u2019s worried that not investing in housing\nfor people in shelter will only exacerbate the growing clog in a system\nlacking housing options.\n\n\u201cRight now we still have thousands of people who don\u2019t even have shelter, not\nto mention those that are in shelter now needing that support,\u201d said Westerman\nin February. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to take a longer investment.\u201d\n\nThe entrance to the Clinton Triangle shelter in Southeast Portland on Feb. 27,\n2024. Guests are allowed to park their cars and other transportation outside\nthe shelter.\n\nAlex Zielinski / OPB\n\nBut back at Clinton Triangle, Urban Alchemy\u2019s Tyler is worried the money won\u2019t\nmaterialize and residents who have already been let down by social service\nproviders in the past will feel misled.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s our responsibility or not, people are going to hold us\naccountable for it, right?\u201d Tyler said. \u201cWe do have it at the forefront of\nevery conversation, we say, \u2018We\u2019re at capacity. We\u2019ve housed this many folks\n... where do we go from here?\u2019\u201d\n\nNewcomers at Clinton Triangle are already hesitant to trust the program\u2019s\npromises.\n\nMegan moved into the shelter in March, after spending two years living in a\ntent. She said she\u2019s relieved to have access to a shower and a warm bed. She\u2019s\nwary of the promise of permanent housing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m meeting people here who have been here since it opened,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not encouraging.\u201d\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:\n\nBecome a Sponsor\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:\n\nBecome a Sponsor\n\n### OPB\u2019s First Look newsletter\n\nSign up to get important news and culture from around the Northwest, delivered\nto your inbox six days a week.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n## Portland Mayor Wheeler unveils a new public camping ban policy\n\nAfter legal hangups skewered his first attempt, Mayor Ted Wheeler is giving a\nban on outdoor camping in Portland a second try.\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\n## How homelessness in Oregon started, grew and became a statewide crisis\n\nThe path out of Oregon's homelessness crisis isn\u2019t simple, nor is it direct.\nBut solutions do exist.
