Something like this terse, six-paragraph memo from the FTC, a\ndeceptively anodyne wrapper for an explosive moment:\n\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events/2022/05/ftc-justice-department-\nlistening-forum-firsthand-effects-mergers-acquisitions-technology\n\nHere's the crux: \"The FTC and DOJ will host a series of listening forums to\nhear from those who have experienced firsthand the effects of mergers and\nacquisitions beyond antitrust experts, including consumers, workers,\nentrepreneurs, start-ups, farmers, investors, and independent businesses.\"\n\nIf you aren't chest-deep in weird antitrust lore, this probably seems like\nit's par for the course. But believe me, this is a hell of a moment \u2013 a moment\nof restoration, a return to a vital, long-dormant principle in American\ngovernance: the idea that corporations should not be allowed to ruin the lives\nof the people around them.\n\nThis was the idea behind antitrust in the first place. As Senator John Sherman\nsaid to Congress as he labored to pass his landmark antitrust law in 1890: \"If\nwe will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King\nover the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life.\"\n\nhttps://marker.medium.com/we-should-not-endure-a-king-dfef34628153\n\n\"If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of\ntrade.\"\n\nThis was the foundation of American antitrust: the idea that companies of a\ncertain scale would, by dint of that size, be in a position to exercise the\nautocratic control of a monarch, and return America to a tyrannical monarchy\ncloaked in the pretense of industry.\n\nFor nearly a century, this was the bedrock of antitrust enforcement, the idea\nof \"harmful dominance\" \u2013 that companies could attain a scale that made them a\ndanger to the very idea of democratic control and legitimacy.\n\nRich people seethed and chafed and schemed to overturn this. They wanted to\nrule as if they were kings, wanted to avoid the scourge of what Peter Thiel\ncalls \"wasteful competition\" (\"competition is for losers\" \u2013 P. Thiel). They\nbankrolled and promoted a deranged conspiracist named Robert Bork \u2013 Nixon's\nsolicitor general \u2013 who advanced a truly bizarre theory of antitrust.\n\nBork was a conspiracist, whose book \"The Antitrust Paradox\" maintained the\nhistorically unsupportable nonsense that what Sherman, Clayton and the other\nlegislators behind America's antitrust laws really wanted was to block\n\"harmful monopolies\" and leave the \"efficient monopolies\" to grow and rule, as\nbenign kings:\n\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down\n\nNow, this is untrue. It's not just untrue, it is unhinged. No reading of\neither the laws in question or the debates preceding their passage supports\nthis idea. It is a fantasy, alternate history. A lie. But it was a convenient\nlie, because if it were true, then all the rich people promoting Bork's fringe\ntheory could create monopolies and rule as kings.\n\nRonald Reagan bought it. After a failed bid to put Bork on the Supreme Court \u2013\nhe failed his confirmation hearing so spectacularly that anyone who self-\nimmolates in DC is said to be \"borked\" \u2013 Reagan adopted his antitrust\ntheories. They spread around the world thanks to other monsters of the era,\nThatcher, Mulroney, Kohl, Pinochet.\n\nThe idea infected the judiciary: the cushy Manne seminars, held every summer\nat a luxury resort, flew in 40% of the Federal bench for indoctrination\nseminars on Bork's theories. These judges learned that the only people who\nshould be consulted on antitrust matters are economists, specifically the kind\nof economist who trades in the kinds of highly abstract, inscrutable\nmathematical models that Bork and his University of Chicago colleagues\nspecialized in.\n\nWhenever a merger was in question, the companies could pay a Chicago economist\nto build a model that proved that the merger was \"efficient\" and thus good for\n\"consumer welfare.\" If that merger resulted in prices skyrocketing \u2013 the one\nthing \"consumer welfare\" was supposed to concern itself with \u2013 those same\neconomists could be paid to produce a new model to prove that the price\nincrease wasn't the result of a monopoly \u2013 it was due to oil prices, or labor\nprices, or the phase of the moon.\n\nPre-Bork, everyone who was harmed by a monopoly had standing to seek redress\nfrom a regulator. If monopolies resulted in pollution, or unsafe working\nconditions, or corruption, or the annihilation of a city's character or a\ntown's way of life, the people affected could tell their stories to a\nregulator and expect that their experiences would be factors in the calculus\nas to whether to prosecute the monopoly.\n\nBut after Bork, the only people whose input mattered was Chicago-style\neconomists whose mathematical models couldn't be interrogated by laypeople.\nThey became court sorcerers to the competition regulators, and when\npetitioners came before the regulator, they would slaughter a goat, read its\nsteaming guts, and pronounce that \"consumer welfare\" was doing fine. If the\npetitioner had the temerity to say that they read something different in the\noffal, the sorcerer could smirk and dismiss them: \"Look who thinks he can read\nthe economy in the guts of a goat? He didn't even get an economics degree from\nthe University of Chicago!\"\n\nFor 40 years, antitrust has been a coma, sleeping while monopolies formed in\nevery sector, destroying our planet, our regulatory integrity, our national\nprosperity, our public safety and the confidence of people in their\ndemocracies.\n\nBut as Stein's Law has it, \"If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\"\nSomething has to give. A new crop of \"neo-Brandeisians\" \u2013 lawyers, economists,\nactivists, workers \u2013 has sprouted, insisting that Bork's ideas have failed us\nand that they need to be set aside.\n\nOne of the most prominent of these is Lina Khan. Today, Khan is the chair of\nthe FTC. Five years ago, she was a third year law student (!), whose landmark\nlaw review article, \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" was a scorching indictment\nof Bork that tore through legal circles and upended orthodoxy:\n\nhttps://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\n\nKhan hasn't been shy about her plans to restore American antitrust to its\nroots as a doctrine of economic liberty, in which workers and small business-\npeople do not have the course of their lives determined by Sherman's\n\"autocrats of trade.\"\n\nShe and the other top Biden antitrust enforcers \u2013 Tim Wu in the White House,\nJonathan Kanter at the DoJ \u2013 worked to produce the Biden executive order on\nantitrust, a genuine landmark document specifying dozens of specific actions\nthat the admin would take to blunt corporate power. Less than a year on,\nthey've hit every milestone in that document.\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-\nactions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-\neconomy/\n\nIn January, the FTC and DoJ announced that they would be reviewing the\nagencies' merger guidelines \u2013 again, something that sounds like business as\nusual to a layperson but really marks an enormous shift in American politics.\nThe new guidelines will make it much harder for big companies to grow by\nmerging with each other or gobbling up little businesses before they can\nbecome competitors.\n\nhttps://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/01/federal-trade-\ncommission-justice-department-seek-strengthen-enforcement-against-illegal-\nmergers\n\nAnd now there's this week's hearings, in which the FTC and DoJ will hear from\n\"who have experienced firsthand the effects of mergers and acquisitions beyond\nantitrust experts, including consumers, workers, entrepreneurs, start-ups,\nfarmers, investors, and independent businesses.\"\n\nWith the exception of \"consumers,\" these are the people who, for 40 years,\nhave been laughed out of the room by antitrust enforcers. The people who have\nbeen told that they have nothing to say when it comes to the way that giant\ncorporations undermine our quality of life, freedom of action, and economic\nchances.\n\nThis may sound like normal activity for a competition regulator (because it\nshould be normal), but this is extraordinary. For the first time in a\ngeneration and a half \u2013 in ten presidential administrations \u2013 everyday people\nwill get a say on whether corporate power should be blunted.\n\nThis is huge.\n\n# Hey look at this (permalink)\n\n  * Ben Franklin\u2019s Abortion Recipe https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/05/ben-franklin-american-instructor-textbook-abortion-recipe.html (\"deeply rooted\" h/t Naked Capitalism)\n\n  * Fuck Nfts Shirt https://tiotee.com/product/fuck-nfts-shirt-the-yetee-merch/\n\n  * Why I, As a Libertarian, Think You\u2019re Silly To Worry About Your So-Called Abortion Rights https://edroso.substack.com/p/why-i-as-a-libertarian-think-youre\n\n# This day in history (permalink)\n\n#20yrsago Virus infects worm\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20020803205728/http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992252\n\n#20yrsago Why Freenet?
