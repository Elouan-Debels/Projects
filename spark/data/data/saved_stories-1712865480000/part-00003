So if you\u2019re over 16\nyou can have an adult phone, but then under the age of 16, you can have a\nchildren\u2019s phone, which will not have all of the social media apps that are\nout there now.\u201d\n\nA March survey by Parentkind, of 2,496 parents of school-age children in\nEngland, found 58% of parents believe the government should ban smartphones\nfor under-16s. It also found more than four in five parents said they felt\nsmartphones were \u201charmful\u201d to children and young people.\n\nIf you really want kids to spend less time online, make space for them in the real world | Gaby Hinsliff\n\nRead more\n\nAnother survey by More in Common revealed 64% of people thought that a ban on\nselling smartphones to under-16s would be a good idea, compared with 20% who\nsaid it was a bad idea.\n\nThe curb was even popular among 2019 Tory voters, according to the thinktank,\nwhich found 72% backed a ban, as did 61% of Labour voters.\n\nBut the thought of another ban has left some Conservatives uneasy. One Tory\ngovernment source described the idea as \u201cout of touch\u201d, noting: \u201cIt\u2019s not the\ngovernment\u2019s role to step in and microparent; we\u2019re meant to make parents more\naware of the powers they have like restrictions on websites, apps and even the\nuse of parental control apps.\u201d\n\nThey said only in extreme cases could the government \u201cparent better than\nactual parents and guardians\u201d.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not comment on speculation. Our\ncommitment to making the UK the safest place to be a child online is\nunwavering, as evidenced by our landmark Online Safety Act.\u201d\n\nRishi Sunak is already braced for a backlash to his plan to ban the next\ngeneration from being able to buy cigarettes. Anyone born on or after 1\nJanuary 2009 \u2013 in effect anyone who is 14 or younger now \u2013 will not legally be\nable to buy cigarettes in England during their lives as the smoking age is\nraised by one year every year, subject to MPs\u2019 approval, under the plans first\nreported in the Guardian.\n\nThe policy was first announced at Conservative party conference last year. But\nsince, then, the Conservative government of New Zealand has said it will\nrevoke the country\u2019s own policy on banning smoking.\n\nExplore more on these topics\n\n  * Smartphones\n  * Social media\n  * Children\n  * Young people\n  * Digital media\n  * England\n  * Mobile phones\n  * news\n\nShare\n\nReuse this content\n\n## More on this story\n\n## More on this story\n\n  * ### Generation Anxiety: smartphones have created a gen Z mental health crisis \u2013 but there are ways to fix it\n\n24 Mar 2024\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncomments\n\n  * ### \u2018It went nuts\u2019: Thousands join UK parents calling for smartphone-free childhood\n\n17 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### \u2018Our kids are suffering\u2019: calls for ban on social media to protect under-16s\n\n11 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Social media algorithms \u2018amplifying misogynistic content\u2019\n\n6 Feb 2024\n\n  * ### Kids are on their phones more than ever.
