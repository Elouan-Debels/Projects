No upgrading\nprevious systems?\n\nImmediate draw backs that I can see 1) I would have to re-install every open-\nsource program I have installed. 2) I would have to back up all of my data. 3)\nI would have to restore all of the backed up data. 4) I would have to re-\ncreate every non-default account that I created.\n\nI am wanting to take courses for OpenVMS as it is very alien to Linux and\nWindows.\n\nIn order of how I want to take them IF people managing course sales ever get\nback to me.\n\n1) OpenVMS Fundamentals - Starting Point 2) OpenVMS System Management I:\nEssentials - Learn basics of system management 3) OpenVMS System Management\nII: Installation/Configuration/Customization - Install OpenVMS as I want it 4)\nDCL Command Procedures: Design and Implementation - Get my DCL abilities to\nfull capacity 5) Managing Complex OpenVMS Systems - Pre-requisite for other\nthings 6) TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS - It's important to software development\n7) OpenVMS Programming Features - Polish my basic programming in OpenVMS 8)\nInternals I - Start understanding lower levels of openvms programming 9)\nInternals II - Increase system programming internals knowledge 10) Internals\nIII - Finish off what is offered in learning the internals. 11) OpenVMS System\nPerformance Management - Optimize OpenVMS with code\n\nI definitely don't qualify for the Ambassador program as I'm too new to\ngetting into OpenVMS, I wanted to delve deep into it as it was the first\noperating system I ever touched as a kid.\n\nThis of course won't stop me. I have spent $1,200.00 a year on a Visual Studio\nProfessional license every year for over a decade for purely personal use. I\nhave dozen's of licenses for every possible version of Windows operating\nsystems since WIndows XP both consumer and Server.\n\nI will be pissed about it for a long time, but if you say it. I'll just buy\nthe commercial license.\n\nAdded in 4 minutes 43 seconds: That is of course assuming the price to buy a\ncommercial license for non-commercial use is only a couple thousand dollars.\nIf it's tens of thousands I'll be priced out.\n\nTop\n\njoukj\n\n    Master\n    Posts: 170\n    Joined: Thu Aug 27, 2020 5:50 am\n    Reputation: 0\n    Status: Offline\n\n### Re: Updates to the Community Program\n\n  * 0\n\n  * Quote\n\nPost by joukj \u00bb Wed Mar 27, 2024 10:48 am\n\nWhat does this mean for the short term? The X86 license will not work from\nnext week on and we'll have to wait till the pre-installed disk is ready. Do\nwe have to apply again. I did not get any mail (also not iy spam-boxes) about\nthis change.\n\nTop\n\nm_detommaso\n\n    Valued Contributor\n    Posts: 73\n    Joined: Thu Jun 06, 2019 6:57 am\n    Reputation: 0\n    Location: Brindisi (Italy)\n    Status: Offline\n    \n\nContact:\n\nContact m_detommaso\n\nWebsite Facebook Twitter\n\n### Re: Updates to the Community Program\n\n  * 0\n\n  * Quote\n\nPost by m_detommaso \u00bb Wed Mar 27, 2024 12:02 pm\n\nhttps://vmssoftware.com/about/news/2024 ... se-update/\n\n... \"Effective immediately, we will discontinue offering new community\nlicenses for non-commercial use for Alpha and Integrity.

There are unlikely to be\nmajor technical obstacles using LICENSE MOVE or LICENSE ISSUE to getting the\nlicenses from the vmdk system onto an existing system. Whether that's\nconsidered kosher is a different question; I don't see anything in the license\nagreement that expressly forbids it, but IANAL.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that you'll always be running stale software\nwith no way to patch or update it. It's probably only useful in the unlikely\ncase when the only thing interesting on a new vmdk is the new license.\n\nSo yes, it may be necessary to move accounts, queues, configurations, etc.,\nfrom an old system disk to a new one. It's certainly possible to do this but\nit's not going to be easy for a VMS newbie, so the folks who purportedly\nbenefit from this distribution mechanism are going to have a pretty tough time\nwhen the second vmdk distribution becomes available, at leat if they've done\nanything interesting with their systems that they want to carry forward.\n\nTop\n\npocketprobe\n\n    Valued Contributor\n    Posts: 60\n    Joined: Sat Apr 15, 2023 11:53 pm\n    Reputation: 0\n    Status: Offline\n\n### Re: Updates to the Community Program\n\n  * 0\n\n  * Quote\n\nPost by pocketprobe \u00bb Wed Mar 27, 2024 11:21 pm\n\nI'm interpreting this as no licensing for additional layered products,\nupdates, and eventual service portal lockout.

No\nway to entice people to get interested in it without having to explain a\nlaundry list of limitations.\n\nI've gotten bug reports for some strange cases from some strange areas and\nsome strange users for open-source stuff i've released\n\nI wonder how much feedback they've gotten so far about this....\n\nLast edited by gdwnldsksc on Thu Mar 28, 2024 8:12 am, edited 5 times in\ntotal.\n\nTop\n\nPost Reply\n\n  * Print view\n\n38 posts\n\n  * 1\n  * 2\n  * 3\n  * 4\n  * Next\n\nReturn to \u201cOfftopic\u201d\n\nJump to\n\n  * VMS Software Inc.\n  * \u21b3 News and Development\n  * \u21b3 General OpenVMS Questions\n  * Software and Layered Products\n  * \u21b3 VMS IDE\n  * \u21b3 OpenLDAP\n  * \u21b3 VMS WebUI\n  * \u21b3 Others\n  * OpenVMS System Management\n  * \u21b3 Installation and Configuration\n  * \u21b3 Security\n  * \u21b3 Disk and Volume Management\n  * \u21b3 Networking\n  * \u21b3 Clustering\n  * \u21b3 Backup and Restore\n  * Programming for OpenVMS\n  * \u21b3 C/C++\n  * \u21b3 Java\n  * \u21b3 DCL\n  * \u21b3 Python\n  * \u21b3 Other Languages\n  * OpenVMS V9.x\n  * \u21b3 Field Test\n  * \u21b3 Compilers\n  * \u21b3 x86 Porting\n  * \u21b3 Virtualization\n  * \u21b3 Cloud\n  * \u21b3 Databases\n  * OpenVMS-Compatible Hardware\n  * \u21b3 VAX\n  * \u21b3 Alpha AXP\n  * \u21b3 Integrity\n  * \u21b3 x86-64\n  * \u21b3 Hardware Emulators\n  * Miscellaneous\n  * \u21b3 Offtopic\n  * \u21b3 Ads and Employment Opportunities\n  * Ask the Wizard\n\n  * Home Board index\n  * Delete cookies\n  * Contact us\n\nFlat Style by Ian Bradley\n\nPowered by phpBB\u00ae Forum Software \u00a9 phpBB Limited\n\nPrivacy | Terms\n\n", "frontpage": false}
