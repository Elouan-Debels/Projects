In this article, we dive into the\npreference data from 6,000 position listings and 68,000 candidate profiles to\nhelp companies understand the current state of the remote market and how\noffering (or not offering) remote work will impact your hiring.\n\nThe key findings were:\n\n  * 67% of candidates are considering fully remote work, but only 16% of positions offer this\n\n  * Since December 2022 the percentage of positions offering fully remote has fallen by half\n\n  * Companies that offer fully remote positions on average see more views, applications, successful conversations, and a higher response rate to messages\n\n### What is the current remote landscape?\n\nWe compared what working arrangements are currently on offer from companies\nand how this differs from the demand from candidates.\n\nCandidates are more flexible with their preferences\n\nOn cord, positions and candidate profiles can list multiple remote working\noptions or preferences from on-site, hybrid or remote.\n\nCompanies are more specific about their requirements than candidates, with\nonly 5% of positions listed with all three working arrangements available,\ncompared to 1/3 of candidate profiles listing all three options.\n\nThere is a shortage of remote positions compared to demand\n\nLooking at the entire company landscape and comparing this to candidate\npreferences, there's a large disparity between what candidates are looking for\nand what\u2019s on offer on the market.\n\n67% of candidates list fully remote working as a preference, however just 16%\nof positions are currently offered as fully remote.\n\nThis gap has been increasing\n\nIn Dec 2022 there were twice as many fully remote positions advertised, with\n34% of positions listed as remote in comparison to 17% today.\n\nDuring that period, demand for remote working has fallen slightly by\ncandidates, but not to the same extent, meaning this gap between supply and\ndemand has widened.\n\nSmaller companies are more likely to offer remote work\n\nLooking into the data split by company size there is a trend that remote\nworking is more common with companies under 500 employees and sharply\ndecreases in 500+ companies.\n\nSummary\n\nThere now exists a major disparity between the number of remote positions and\nthe number of people considering remote roles, meaning talent teams can gain a\nsignificant advantage over competitors by offering fully remote work.\n\n### Remote companies have more hiring success\n\nWe compared the impact of working preferences on the outcomes of positions\nadvertised in the last 2 months, to reveal that fully remote positions perform\nbetter than hybrid or on-site.\n\nMore applications\n\nRemote positions received 44% more applications per position compared with\nHybrid and Onsite.\n\nHigher sourcing response rate\n\nSourcing messages sent about Remote and Hybrid positions have a higher\ncandidate acceptance rate.\n\nMore successful conversations\n\nRemote positions have twice as many successful conversations compared to\nOnsite, and 24% more than Hybrid\n\nIncreased visibility\n\nRemote positions received 37% higher views on their positions and were nearly\ntwice as likely to be favourited by candidates than Hybrid and Onsite\npositions\n\nSummary\n\nFully remote positions give you more visibility, are more favourable with\ncandidates, and result in better results with more applications and\nconversations with candidates in your pipeline. Offering remote work will\nlikely increase your chances of hiring success.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere is a disparity in the market between what candidates are looking for in\nfully remote working and what is on offer from companies. This disparity has\nincreased over the last year, with the number of remote positions available\ndecreasing by 50%.\n\nHiring metrics show that offering remote working significantly improves every\naspect of candidate attraction.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to stand out from your competitors and increase your chances\nof hiring success, offering fully remote work is a great way to achieve this.\n\nRebecca Ace, Hiring Insights Team\n\nThursday, 4 April 2024\n\nWas this content useful?\n\n### Table of contents\n\n### Start hiring on cord\n\n#### Get instant access and applications from thousands of active, responsive\ndevelopers and start making direct hires\n\n## You might also like\n\n#### Candidate insights\n\n### Engineer interviews: Building a process that attracts great candidates\n\nLessons from over 300 engineers on how to reduce your interview drop-out rate\n\nCandidate Preferences\n\nInterviews\n\nCandidate Experience\n\n#### Talent Landscape Reports\n\n### 2024 Hiring Playbook\n\nInsights & Strategies for Talent Managers\n\nSourcing\n\nGender diversity\n\nApplications\n\nHiring\n\nMarket Update\n\n#### Candidate insights\n\n### How to attract quality applications\n\nAnalysis of a recent candidate survey and company behaviour data to provide\nactionable advice for hiring-teams\n\n## Topics you may like\n\nTalent Landscape ReportsCandidate insightsDiversity & inclusionHiring leaders\nawardsProduct featuresWebinars\n\nYou're offline\n\n", "frontpage": false}
