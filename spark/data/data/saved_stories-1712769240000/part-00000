When\nlooking at a uniform or multimodal distribution, the concept of tails isn\u2019t\nreally useful for me. But I can see when a distribution looks more or less\npeaked in the middle, or wider toward the top. Try looking at the following\ngraph with that in mind and see what I mean:\n\nAlso this:\n\nHope someone else finds that useful!
