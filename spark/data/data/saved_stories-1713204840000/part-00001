So far, we have seen some\ntraffic shifts in both Israel and Iran, but we haven\u2019t seen a coordinated\nlarge cyberattack on Israeli domains protected by Cloudflare.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s discuss general Internet traffic patterns. Following reports of\nattacks with drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles, confirmed by\nIsraeli and US authorities, Internet traffic in Israel surged after 02:00\nlocal time on Saturday, April 13 (23:00 UTC on April 12), peaking at 75%\nhigher than in the previous week around 02:30 (23:30 UTC) as people sought\nnews updates. This traffic spike was predominantly driven by mobile device\nusage, accounting for 62% of all traffic from Israel at that time. Traffic\nremained higher than usual during Sunday.\n\nAround that time, at 02:00 local time (23:00 UTC), the IDF (Israel Defense\nForces) posted on X that sirens were sounding across Israel because of an\nimminent attack from Iran.\n\n> \ud83d\udea8Sirens sounding across Israel\ud83d\udea8 pic.twitter.com/BuDasagr10\n>\n> \u2014 Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) April 13, 2024\n\n(April 15 UPDATE: the Palestinian territories related part). At around the\nsame time, 01:25 local time (22:45 UTC), when the sirens were sounding in\nIsrael, we observed not an increase, but a clear drop in traffic in\nPalestinian territories. The noticeable drop was seen in all of the\nPalestinian governorates, although it was a bigger drop in the West Bank, than\nin the Gaza Strip.\n\nUsually, based on our past observations, drops in traffic unrelated to\nconnectivity issues can occur when people pause their online activities for\nsome reason (an eclipse or war, for example) or turn to television for news\nupdates instead of the Internet (common during election days when TVs\nbroadcast the latest exit polls).\n\nHere\u2019s the noticeable HTTP requests drop in Hebron, one of the most populated\nstates of the Palestinian territories, part of the West Bank. The noticeable\ndrops in the blue line from the previous week are related to the Ramadan, and\nthe Iftar, the first meal after sunset that breaks the fast and often also a\nfamily or community event. Ramadan ended on Tuesday, April 9, 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, in Iran, there has been a noticeable decline in traffic over the\npast few days in the early morning hours, around 04:30 local time (01:00 UTC),\nas compared to the previous week. However, this decline appears to be linked\nto the conclusion of Ramadan, which ended April 9. As we have written before,\nduring Ramadan, there is typically an increase in traffic around 04:00 in most\nMuslim countries for Suhur, the pre-dawn meal. Nevertheless, traffic was\nhigher in Iran early in the morning of Sunday, April 14 than the previous day,\nbetween 02:30 local time (23:00 UTC on April 13) and 07:00 (03:30 UTC).\n\nWhen analyzing application layer attacks, we haven\u2019t observed any significant\nchanges in those targeting Israel over the past few days. However, over the\npast month, the Government Administration sector emerged as the most targeted\nindustry, with blocked DDoS requests accounting for 46% of all traffic\ndirected towards it.\n\nBased on Cloudflare data, we have not yet seen a coordinated cyberattack\ncampaign targeting Israel. However, we saw a clear uptick in attacks back in\nOctober 2023, after the Israel-Hamas war started, as we noted in a blog post\nat that time.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation in the Middle East, and you can keep\ntrack of by country up-to-date trends visiting Cloudflare Radar, and following\nus on social media at @CloudflareRadar (X), cloudflare.social/@radar\n(Mastodon), and radar.cloudflare.com (Bluesky).\n\nWe protect entire corporate networks, help customers build Internet-scale\napplications efficiently, accelerate any website or Internet application, ward\noff DDoS attacks, keep hackers at bay, and can help you on your journey to\nZero Trust.\n\nVisit 1.1.1.1 from any device to get started with our free app that makes your\nInternet faster and safer.\n\nTo learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, start here.\nIf you're looking for a new career direction, check out our open positions.\n\nDiscuss on Hacker News\n\nCloudflare RadarIsraelInternet TrafficTrends\n\nFollow on X\n\nJo\u00e3o Tom\u00e9|@emot\n\nCloudflare|@cloudflare\n\nRelated posts\n\nApril 12, 2024 1:00 PM\n\n## Improving authoritative DNS with the official release of Foundation DNS\n\nWe are launching Foundation DNS \u2013 our new enterprise-grade authoritative DNS\noffering.
