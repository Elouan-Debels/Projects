BTS aims to\nsend tiny gram-scale, light sail picospacecraft to our neighbour, Proxima\nCentauri B. In BTS\u2019s scheme, lasers would propel a whole fleet of tiny probes\nto the potentially water-rich exoplanet.\n\nNow, another company, Space Initiatives Inc., is tackling the idea. NASA has\nfunded them so they can study the idea. What can we expect to learn from the\neffort?\n\nProxima b may be a close neighbour in planetary terms. But it\u2019s in a\ncompletely different solar system, about four light-years away. That means any\nprobes sent there must travel at relativistic speeds if we want them to arrive\nin a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThat\u2019s why Space Initiatives Inc. proposes such tiny spacecraft. With their\nsmall masses, direct lasers can propel them to their destination. That means\nthey must send a swarm of hundreds or even one thousand probes to get valuable\nscientific results.\n\nThis is much different than the architecture that missions usually conform to.\nMost missions are a single spacecraft, perhaps with a smaller attached probe\nlike the Huygens probe attached to the Cassini spacecraft. How does using a\nswarm change the mission? What results can we expect?\n\n> \u201cWe anticipate our innovations would have a profound effect on space\n> exploration.\u201d\n>\n> Thomas Eubanks, Space Inititatives Inc.\n\nA new presentation at the 55th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC)\nin Texas examined the idea. It\u2019s titled \u201cSCIENTIFIC RETURN FROM IN SITU\nEXPLORATION OF THE PROXIMA B EXOPLANET.\u201d The lead author is T. Marshall\nEubanks from Space Initiatives Inc., a start-up developing 50-gram\nfemtosatellites that weigh less than 100 grams (3.5 oz.)\n\nTiny probes like these can only do flybys. They\u2019re too tiny and low-mass for\nanything else. When designing a mission like this, the first consideration is\nwhether the probes will operate as a dispersed or coherent swarm. In a\ndispersed swarm, the probes reach their destination sequentially. In a\ncoherent swarm, the probes are together when they do their flyby. Both\narchitectures have their merits.\n\nIn either case, these tiny solar sail probes will be very thin. But thanks to\ntechnological advances, they can still gather high-resolution images by\nworking together.\n\nThe image below shows 247 probes forming an array as they fly by Proxima b.\nTogether, they have the light-collecting area of a three-meter telescope. This\narrangement should enable sub-arc-second resolutions at optical wavelengths.\nSpectroscopy should be equally as fine.\n\n\u201cWhile both erosion by the Interstellar Medium (ISM) and image smearing will\ndegrade imaging, we anticipate these systems will enable sub-arcsecond\nresolution imaging and spectroscopy of the target planet,\u201d the authors write.\n\nThis image from the presentation shows how the probe swarm would arrive at\nProxima b. (Note that the planned swarm dispersion is much smaller than is\nindicated here.) Image Credit: Eubanks et al. 2024.\n\nThese tiny spacecraft could do some course correction, but not much. So,\ngetting the navigation right is critical. Unfortunately, our data on Proxima\nb\u2019s orbit is not as well-understood as the planets in our own Solar System. It\nall comes down to ephemeris.\n\nEphemeris tables show the trajectory of planets and other objects in space.\nBut in Proxima b\u2019s case, the ephemeris error is potentially quite large.\n\nAdded to that is the distance. If the probes can travel at 20% of light speed,\nreaching the planet will take over 21 years. The authors calculate that if\nthey can restrict Proxima b\u2019s ephemeris error to 100,000 km and send 1,000\nprobes, at least one will come within 1,000 km of the planet. \u201cMeeting this\nephemeris error goal will require improved astrometry of the Proxima system,\u201d\nthe authors write.\n\nThe probes would perform science observations on their way to Proxima b. As\nthey travel, the swarm would have dozens or even hundreds of opportunities to\nuse microlensing to study stellar objects. A stellar mass microlensing event\nrequiring one month on Earth would only take one hour.\n\n\u201cIt is now possible to predict lensing events for nearby stars; BTS probe\nobservations of dozens or hundreds of predicted microlensing events by nearby\nstars will offer both a means of observing these systems and a novel means of\ninterstellar navigation,\u201d the authors explain.\n\nThe swarm would be only the third mission to leave our Solar System. The\nVoyage spacecraft left the heliosphere, but only inadvertently. So, the swarm\ncould observe the interstellar medium (ISM) during its 20+ year journey. One\nof the questions we have about the local ISM concerns clouds. We only have\npoor data on the nature of these clouds, and scientists aren\u2019t certain if our\nSolar System is in the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC.)\n\n\u201cIn situ observation of the properties of these clouds will be a primary\nscientific goal for mission science during the long interstellar voyage,\u201d the\nresearchers write.\n\nThere are clouds in the ISM near our Solar System. But we don\u2019t know much\nabout them, including if our Solar System is in the LIC or if it\u2019s leaving it.\nImage Credit: Interstellar Probe/JHUAPL\n\nOpportunistic science during the voyage is great, but arrival at Proxima b is\nthe meat of the mission. One day before the probes arrive, they would still be\n35 AU away. At that point, the mission could begin imaging. Proxima b would\nstill only be several pixels across, but it\u2019s enough to see any visible moons.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it would be worth turning some probes to face forward and\nbegin imaging the Proxima system to search for undiscovered planets, moons and\nasteroids in the system, and to begin a Proxima b approach video,\u201d the\nresearchers explain.\n\nUpon arrival at Proxima Centauri b, a one-meter aperture telescope 6,000 km\naway from the planet could attain a six-meter resolution on the surface.\nThat\u2019s an idealistic number, as not all of the planet\u2019s surface could be\nimaged at that resolution. PCb is also tidally locked to its star, meaning one\nside is in darkness. Because of that, the mission should be designed to gather\nlow-light and infrared images of the night side. \u201cNight-side illumination\nimagery might also be the most conclusive technosignature from an initial\nProxima mission,\u201d the authors write.\n\nAs probes pass through Proxima b\u2019s shadow, they could use the light from the\nstar to perform spectroscopy. Probes passing behind Proxima b could use the\nEarth laser system for spectrometry, and if the probes are in a coherent\nswarm, they could use the lasers from pairs of probes on either side of the\nplanet.\n\n\u201cTransmission spectroscopy, which for Proxima b cannot be done from Earth,\u201d\nthe researchers explain, \u201cwill likely provide the best means of determining\nthe existence of a biology or even a technological society on Proxima b\nthrough the search for the spectral lines of biomarkers and technomarkers.\u201d\n\nAs humanity\u2019s first mission to Proxima Centauri b, the swarm would face some\nhurdles and uncertainties. But in a coherent swarm architecture, the mission\ncould also be almost too successful. \u201cA BTS mission, especially with a\ncoherent swarm, may collect more data than can be returned to Earth,\u201d the\nauthors write. If the data returned has to be selected autonomously by the\nswarm itself, that could be more demanding than deciding what data to collect\nin the first place.\n\nScientists have many questions about Proxima Centauri b. Should the swarm ever\nbe launched, any amount of data it returns will be valuable. Even though it\u2019ll\ntake over four years for the data to be sent back to Earth.\n\nAn artist\u2019s conception of a violent flare erupting from the red dwarf star\nProxima Centauri. Such flares can obliterate the atmospheres of nearby\nplanets. Credit: NRAO/S. Dagnello.\n\nScientists don\u2019t know how hot the planet is. They\u2019re not certain if it even\nhas liquid water. It looks like the planet is just over one Earth mass and has\na slightly higher radius. But those measurements are uncertain. Scientists are\nalso uncertain about its composition. The star it orbits is a flare star,\nwhich means the planet could be subjected to extremely powerful bursts of\nradiation. That\u2019s a lot of uncertainty.\n\nBut it\u2019s the nearest exoplanet, the only one we could feasibly reach in a\nrealistic amount of time. That alone makes it a desirable target.\n\nThere\u2019s no final plan for a mission like this. It\u2019s largely conceptual. But\nthe technology to do it is coming along. NASA has funded a mission study, so\nit definitely has merit.\n\n\u201cFortunately, we don\u2019t have to wait until mid-century to make practical\nprogress \u2013 we can explore and test swarming techniques now in a simulated\nenvironment, which is what we propose to do in this work,\u201d said report lead\nauthor Thomas Eubanks from Space Initiatives Inc. \u201cWe anticipate our\ninnovations would have a profound effect on space exploration, complementing\nexisting techniques and enabling entirely new types of missions, for example,\npicospacecraft swarms covering all of cislunar space or instrumenting an\nentire planetary magnetosphere.\u201d\n\nEubanks also points out how a swarm of probes could investigate interstellar\nobjects that pass through our inner Solar System, like Oumuamua.\n\nBut the main mission would be the one to Proxima Centauri b. According to\nEubanks, that would happen sometime in the third quarter of this century.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n  * Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCategoriesMissions, Proxima b, Space Exploration TechnologiesTagslaser\npropulsion, light sail, probe swarm, proxima centauri b, space probes,\nspectroscopy\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
