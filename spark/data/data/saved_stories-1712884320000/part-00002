But the effects can be felt for\nmonths\n\nBy Mansee Khurana\n\nThursday, April 11, 2024 \u2022 5:01 AM EDT\n\nHeard on Morning Edition\n\nContent warning: This story contains vulgar language, threats of sexual\nviolence and death threats.\n\nDoxxing \u2014 the practice of publishing someone's private information for revenge\nor punishment \u2014 has been around since the early days of the internet. It's\nbeen used against reporters, law enforcement personnel and women speaking out\nagainst sexual abuse.\n\nSince last fall, doxxing campaigns have been used to \"name and shame\" those\nwho express opinions about the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe names of Harvard students who signed onto a statement from the student\ngroup Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee were plastered on\nbillboards near the university's campus. A scientific journal fired its\neditor-in-chief for retweeting a satire article. A Florida school district\nplaced a teacher on leave for sending an email about recognizing the\nPalestinian community. NYU Langone Health fired a doctor for pro-Israel social\nmedia posts.\n\nWhile most doxxing campaigns only last a few days, their effects can be felt\nfor months.\n\nOn Nov. 2, Olivia Lynch was walking home from dinner in Brooklyn, N.Y., when\nshe saw a poster that she had seen a few times since the Hamas-led attack on\nIsrael on Oct. 7.\n\n\"My first reaction was a twinge in my heart,\" Lynch said. \"Wow, look at this\ncute kid. Look at these lovely looking people who are being used as pawns in a\nwar. This is awful.\"\n\nThe poster is designed to look like a standard missing persons poster, but\nwith the addition of the word \"kidnapped\" in bright red at the top and one of\nthe faces of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas. The posters are available for\nfree online in more than 30 languages, and anyone can print them out and\ndistribute them. The creators of these posters, Israeli artists Nitzan Mintz,\nDede Bandaid and Tal Huber, told NPR in a statement that these posters are\nmeant to raise awareness of the innocent civilians being held captive.\n\nSome people, including the artists themselves, believe that tearing down these\nposters is an antisemitic act, and videos of people tearing down these posters\nhave gone viral.\n\nLynch doesn't believe that taking down the posters is antisemitic.\n\n\"These posters don't exist in a vacuum,\" Lynch said. \"I think they are serving\nto amplify the messaging that one was seeing, that Israel is completely\njustified in what they are doing in Gaza.\"\n\nSo, on Nov. 2, Lynch tore down a poster she saw on her walk home.\n\n\"What was going through my mind at this point was that this poster is\njustifying the destruction of Gaza because of these hostages,\" Lynch said.\n\nSomeone filmed Lynch doing so, and by the morning, a video of her tearing down\nthe poster was on the internet. Instagram pages like @JewsHateDatabase posted\nthe video with the caption: \"Help us find out who she is \u2014 Jew hater spotted\nin Williamsburg Brooklyn.\"\n\nNPR sent multiple requests for a comment to the page's creators but hasn't\nreceived a response.\n\nLynch got hundreds of emails filled with death threats, threats of sexual\nviolence and promises to get her fired from her job teaching at an after-\nschool nature program called Wild Ferns with fewer than five people on staff.\n\nOne email reviewed by NPR read, \"I hope you get lynched like your last name\nsuggests.\" Another person wrote to her, \"Hope you get raped by Nazi Hamas and\nburn in hell.\" Another read, \"I will make sure every employer knows who you\nare.\"\n\nLynch's employer wasn't spared from the messages. The small business received\nthousands of emails, one-star Google Reviews and Instagram comments demanding\nLynch be fired.\n\nLynch was at work when her phone started to light up with texts from concerned\nfriends less than 24 hours after the video of her taking down the poster went\nviral.\n\n\"I immediately thought that I needed to try and do damage control,\" Lynch\nsaid.\n\n### The consequences\n\nDays after she tore down the poster, Lynch got a call from her boss: She had\nbeen fired.\n\nShe filed a claim for unemployment benefits a few weeks later, arguing that\nshe had a right to express political opinions outside of the workplace.\n\n\"I considered it to be maybe a small act of civil disobedience,\" Lynch said.\n\"It was nonviolent. I was taking down an inflammatory piece of propaganda.\"\n\nThe New York State Department of Labor denied her claim, stating that she \"was\nheld to a higher standard caring for children\" and \"knew or should\" have known\nher actions would jeopardize her job.\n\nLynch filed an appeal to the state's decision, which is currently pending.\n\nEnrique Armijo, a law professor at Elon University, said that Lynch might not\nhave much of a legal case because the First Amendment only applies in cases\nwhere the government is restricting free speech, not a private business or\nemployer.\n\n\"We're not really talking about the First Amendment with respect to private\npeople who are posting flyers or tearing down flyers or saying things about\nother people on social media,\" Armijo said.\n\nRelated Story: The Telegram app has a global doxing issue\n\nIt's clear to Armijo why a small business would make the decision to fire an\nemployee who is the subject of a doxxing campaign.\n\n\"Employers have to run business,\" Armijo said. \"They cannot deal with the\nbarrage of comments from strangers saying that someone should be fired.\"\n\nWild Ferns denied an interview for this story but did send NPR a statement in\nwhich the business stated it had been struggling financially for a while. And\nafter this incident, \"the financial and emotional toll was so immense\" that\nthey've decided to \"suspend the program indefinitely,\" according to the\nstatement.\n\n### How do incidents like this affect free speech culture?\n\nAaron Terr, the Director of Public Advocacy at the Foundation for Individual\nRights and Expression (FIRE), a nonprofit that works to protect free speech,\nsaid that while none of these actions \u2014 tearing down a poster, doxxing someone\nor firing someone for misconduct \u2014 are illegal, they do hurt free speech\nculture in the U.S.\n\n\"If Americans feel like trip wires are everywhere and they don't know exactly\nwhat they can and can't say, you end up in a scenario where millions of\nAmericans opt out of the national political conversation,\" Terr said.\n\nRelated Story: The state of free speech, antisemitism on college campuses\npreceding Israel-Hamas war\n\nTerr believes social media has exacerbated this problem because it's now\neasier for people to send messages harassing businesses to fire someone for\nsomething they've seen online.\n\n\"It has facilitated rapid mass pile-ons in a way that wasn't possible before,\"\nTerr said.\n\nHowever, Terr said it is hard to completely defend Lynch's actions. While he\nthinks that firing someone for actions that took place outside of work is\nincredibly harmful to free speech culture, he sees tearing down a poster as a\ntype of heckler's veto, which is when a speaker's message is silenced by a\ndissenting party.\n\n\"You're not just expressing your own views about something,\" Terr said.\n\"You're also interfering with other people's ability to express their views on\nthe same issue.\"\n\nLynch says she understands that her action can be interpreted in different\nways, but she doesn't think she should've been fired or sent death threats\nbecause of what she did. She said she views those messages as an attempt to\nmake her afraid to speak out.\n\n\"But I will never feel afraid,\" Lynch said. \"I have felt angry at times, maybe\na bit sad, but I've never felt afraid because I am part of something that is\nfar bigger than me.\"\n\nThe audio version of this story was edited by Ashley Westerman.

This practice is pretty common in some online cultures, and it\nsays that it can hurt people's ability to express their opinions. NPR's Mansee\nKhurana has the story of one woman who was doxxed. And we should warn, this\nstory contains some vulgar language.\n\nMANSEE KHURANA, BYLINE: The posters had sprung up all over Olivia Lynch's\nBrooklyn neighborhood. They were black and white, the word kidnapped in bright\nred splashed across the top - below, the face of one of the 240 hostages taken\nby Hamas on October 7.\n\nOLIVIA LYNCH: And my first reaction was that twinge in my heart. Wow, look at\nthis cute kid. Look at these lovely-looking people who are being used as pawns\nin a war. This is awful.\n\nKHURANA: But when Lynch saw these posters, she didn't just see the hostages'\nfaces. She sees a genocide taking place, as Israeli airstrikes in retaliation\nfor the Hamas attacks on October 7 send the death toll in Gaza into the tens\nof thousands.\n\nLYNCH: I think these posters convince people that everything that Israel, with\nthe backing of the U.S. government, are doing to Palestinians is justified.\n\nKHURANA: And on the night of November 2, on her way home from dinner, Lynch\ntore down one of those posters.\n\nLYNCH: I considered it to be maybe a small act of civil disobedience. It was\nnonviolent. I was taking down an inflammatory piece of propaganda.\n\nKHURANA: While she was pulling down the poster from the light pole on which it\nhung, someone filmed her.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: That 6-month-old really did a lot to you, huh?\n\nLYNCH: [Expletive] Israel.\n\nKHURANA: By the morning, a video of her tearing down the poster and shouting\nexpletives was on the internet. Instagram accounts like @JewsHateDatabase\nposted the video with the caption, help us find out who she is - Jew hater\nspotted in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\n\nLYNCH: This was a difficult thing to hear. My issue with the posters is not\nthe people in these posters.\n\nKHURANA: By the afternoon she had been doxxed, her email address, workplace\nand parents' home address all made public. She started receiving death threats\nand threats of sexual violence. Aaron Terr is the director of public advocacy\nat the Foundation of Individual Rights and Expression. He says doxxing - short\nfor dropping documents - may give people doing it immediate satisfaction, but\nit actually hurts everybody's ability to speak freely.\n\nAARON TERR: If Americans feel like tripwires are everywhere and they don't\nknow exactly what they can and can't say, you end up in a scenario where\nmillions of Americans opt out of the national political conversation.\n\nKHURANA: A Pew Research Center survey in 2021 found that 41% of Americans have\nexperienced some form of online harassment. About half of that group said that\nthe harassment was because of their political views. Terr says that in our\ncurrent free speech culture, everyone is at risk for doxing.\n\nTERR: Everyone sort of just has to make a personal, individual calculation\nabout, you know, an issue is important enough for them that they want to speak\nout against it.\n\nKHURANA: Anyone can be doxxed from celebrities to politicians to musicians, to\nnormal people like Olivia Lynch. For her, getting doxxed led to a lot of\nstress.\n\nLYNCH: I had really lost my appetite and was having trouble sleeping because\nof this.\n\nKHURANA: And losing her job. She was fired just two days after that video went\nviral. Even when Lynch tried to file for unemployment benefits, the New York\nState Department of Labor denied her claim because of the video. NPR reached\nout to the department to ask if this was a typical reason to deny unemployment\nbenefits, but that request is still pending. What's tricky about experiences\nlike Lynch's is that all of it is legal - the tearing down the poster, the\ndoxxing, the firing. Enrique Armijo is a law professor at Elon University. He\nsays experiences like Lynch's will probably keep happening. There are no laws\nagainst doxxing because, he says, doxxing is a form of free speech.\n\nENRIQUE ARMIJO: When you're talking about things like intent and offense, it's\nvery difficult to come up with an objective standard, right? Offensiveness is\nalmost by definition a subjective standard because what might offend you might\nnot offend me.\n\nKHURANA: Olivia Lynch doesn't regret her decision.\n\nLYNCH: I refuse to be held responsible for the actions of a racist, sexist\nonline mob. That's not fair (laughter). I mean, I took down a poster.\n\nKHURANA: And she's not going to let what happened to her stop her from\nspeaking her mind.\n\nMansee Khurana, NPR News.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF GIZMO VARILLAS' \"EL DORADO\")\n\n\u00a9 NPR\n\n", "frontpage": true}
