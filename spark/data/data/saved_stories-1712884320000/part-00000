Yale University, Dartmouth College, and\nBrown University used the same rationale to restore testing requirements\nearlier this year; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology revived its\nstandardized testing requirement two years ago.\n\nThe move comes as the nation\u2019s top colleges search for ways to maintain racial\nand socioeconomic diversity on campus without using race as a factor in\nadmissions, which the US Supreme Court prohibited in its landmark affirmative\naction ruling against last summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHopi Hoekstra, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences at Harvard, said\nstandardized tests help colleges predict student success regardless of a\nstudent\u2019s background. Students who did not submit test scores, she said, may\nhave unintentionally withheld information that could have strengthened their\noverall application.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, we know that talent is universal, but opportunity is not,\u201d\nHoekstra said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWith this change, we hope to\nstrengthen our ability to identify these promising students, and to give\nHarvard the opportunity to support their development as thinkers and leaders\nwho will contribute to shaping our world.\u201d\n\n#### Related\n\nFrom athletes to clarinetists: Who gets preferential treatment in top college\nadmissions?Brown University to reinstate standardized test requirementsNew\nresearch jumbles SAT requirements at top colleges\n\nThe college dropped its standardized testing requirement in 2020, as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic limited some students\u2019 access to the tests. Applicants had\nthe option of submitting ACT and SAT scores to supplement their applications.\nThe majority of students who matriculated at Harvard in past four years did\nso, even though it wasn\u2019t required, according to the university.\n\nCritics have long asserted standardized tests are biased toward students from\nwealthier families, who are more likely to take expensive test prep classes\nand have better educational opportunities overall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, however, research by the Harvard-affiliated Opportunity\nInsights group found that standardized exams can help identify standout\napplicants from low-income backgrounds whose raw scores might not be as high\nas upper income students\u2019, but who outperform their classmates. That lined up\nwith some earlier studies, including one from a committee at the University of\nCalifornia system, which found tests like the SAT were more likely to predict\nstudent achievement than high school GPAs.\n\nOpportunity Insights also found that preferences toward legacy admissions and\nstudent athletes do more to restrict diversity than requiring standardized\ntests.\n\nRaj Chetty, a Harvard professor of economics and the director of Opportunity\nInsights, said in a statement that it\u2019s true standardized tests are biased\ntoward students from higher-income families, who may have greater access to\ntest prep resources.\n\n\u201cBut the data reveal that other measures \u2014 recommendation letters,\nextracurriculars, essays \u2014 are even more prone to such biases,\u201d Chetty said.\n\u201cConsidering standardized test scores is likely to make the admissions process\nat Harvard more meritocratic while increasing socioeconomic diversity.\u201d\n\nDavid J. Deming, academic dean of the Harvard Kennedy School, said the\nwidespread availability and the universality of the tests help ensure\nfairness, though some barriers still exist.\n\n\u201cNot everyone can hire an expensive college coach to help them craft a\npersonal essay. But everyone has the chance to ace the SAT or the ACT,\u201d Deming\nsaid in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhillip Levine, a Wellesley College economics professor and expert in the\nbusiness of higher education, said Harvard\u2019s move is more evidence that elite\ncolleges are moving back toward the SAT requirement.\n\n\u201cClearly, this is going to start filtering down to other institutions as\nwell,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Levine said it was too early to say whether less-exclusive schools would\nfollow Harvard and the other Ivies\u2019 lead.\n\n\u201cYou get more applications if you don\u2019t require the SAT. So in a world in\nwhich you\u2019re seeking more applications, reinstituting the requirement may not\nbe advantageous for you,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the top end of the market, where you\u2019re\nless worried about applications, that is less of a problem.\u201d\n\nBob Schaeffer, director of public education at the National Center for Fair &\nOpen Testing, a nonprofit that tracks and critiques standardized exams and\ntesting companies, said he did not anticipate Harvard\u2019s policy change would\ncreate waves among colleges nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe Ivy League and the other super-selective schools are exceptions to the\ngeneral rule,\u201d he said.\n\nSchaeffer said other schools will likely closely monitor diversity and student\nsuccess data at Harvard and elsewhere throughout the next academic year before\ndetermining whether to revive their own testing requirements.\n\nIn a survey of more than 200 of the nation\u2019s top test-optional liberal arts\ncolleges and universities conducted by education services company Kaplan Inc.,\nwhich offers test preparation courses for the ACT, SAT, and others, around 15\npercent said they were considering reinstating standardized testing\nrequirements, according to Kaplan. Around two-thirds of surveyed schools said\nsubmitting an ACT or SAT score helps students\u2019 applications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor applicants without access to the SAT or ACT, Harvard said it will accept a\nhandful of alternative tests, including Advanced Placement exam results and\nInternational Baccalaureate scores.\n\nJoy St. John, Harvard\u2019s director of admissions, said there may be fewer\nstudents taking the SAT or ACT than in the past, and accessing those tests can\ncreate barriers for international applicants.\n\n\u201cWe hope that promising students faced with such challenges will still apply,\nusing alternative forms of testing,\u201d St. John said in a statement Thursday.\n\nLevine said having a wider scope of application materials allows admissions\ncounselors to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of different metrics, which\nis overall beneficial to the system.\n\n\u201cRegardless of how you think about it, there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect\nmeasure of who you should accept,\u201d Levine said.\n\nDaniel Kool can be reached at daniel.kool@globe.com.
