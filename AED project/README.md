#General information
This project entails the finding of the optimal location of public AED devices spread throughout the country. AED devices are used to assist in resuscitating people undergoing cardiac arrest, meaning strategically placed AED's can save lives. Here, a comprehensive analysis of the current locations of these devices and their optimal locations is conducted, using various machine learning and statistical modeling principles.

# MDAProject
Anaconda was used to create the environment, so it is recommended that this is also used when running the project for yourself. Use the environment.yml, rather than the requirements.txt, because of this.
The datasets required to run the R script and notebooks are located in the data folder. All other data available here is output from the project.
