# MDAProject
Anaconda was used to create the environment, so it is recommended that this is also used when running the project for yourself. Use the environment.yml, rather than the requirements.txt, because of this.
The datasets required to run the R script and notebooks are located in the data folder. All other data available here is output from the project.
